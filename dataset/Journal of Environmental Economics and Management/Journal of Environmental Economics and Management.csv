Understanding the impacts of and consumer response to electricity quality improvements is important for development and the environment. We investigate this in the Kyrgyz Republic through randomized improvements in the grid, which can improve electricity service quality. Treated households experience significantly fewer voltage fluctuations per day, an indicator of improved electricity quality post-intervention. Treated households’ billed consumption of electricity services increased during peak months post-intervention, with increases in consumption of 4% and 18% for homeowners and renters, respectively. Consistent with this, treated households, particularly renters, significantly increased ownership of electric heaters. Treated households invested more in energy efficiency, potentially mitigating their electricity bill increases post-intervention.","Although electricity access has increased during the 21st century, poor electricity service quality remains a persistent problem in many developing countries (Zhang, 2018, Burgess et al., 2020, Carranza and Meeks, 2021). This impedes development, as low-quality and irregular electricity services limit consumption and attenuate the economic benefits from grid connections, affecting firms both in the short-run (Fisher-Vanden et al., 2015, Allcott et al., 2016, Cole et al., 2018, Hardy and Mccasland, 2019, Mahadevan, 2021) and in the long-run general-equilibrium (Fried and Lagakos, forthcoming).====Understanding residential consumers’ responses to experiencing changes in electricity quality is also important. Pro-poor growth in developing countries is expected to result in greater household appliance ownership and increased residential electricity demand (Wolfram et al., 2012). Yet hundreds of millions of households depend on grid connections that provide low-quality and unreliable electricity services (Day, 2020) and variable service quality introduces important heterogeneity potentially affecting households’ benefits from electrification (Chakravorty et al., 2014, Samad and Zhang, 2016, Samad and Zhang, 2017, Hashemi, 2022).==== Recent evidence indicates a substantial willingness-to-pay for improved electricity service quality (Alberini et al., 2020, Deutschmann et al., 2021, Meles et al., 2021, Hashemi, 2021) and models indicate households likely respond to such improvements via their appliance ownership (McRae, 2010). If improvements in electricity quality (i.e., fewer voltage fluctuations and more hours per day of full service provision) result in greater residential consumption of electricity services, there are implications not only for household well-being, but for the environment as well (Jayachandran, 2021) as 71% of electricity production in low and middle income countries is generated from burning oil, gas, and coal (IEA/OECD, 2018). Yet little evidence exists on the impacts of – and response to – electricity quality improvements among residential consumers.====This paper reports results from the first randomized experiment designed to provide exogenous variation in electricity service quality. Our experiment does so through randomized improvements in the quality of the grid in the Kyrgyz Republic, a lower-middle-income country in Central Asia with electricity quality issues common to many developing countries, such as daily voltage fluctuations and frequent outages. We ask: what are the impacts of customers experiencing and learning about improvements in service quality on residential billed electricity consumption? Billed electricity consumption could increase for multiple reasons, both due to mechanical changes (i.e., customers can run their existing appliances more due to better service quality) as well as consumer investments (i.e., they invest in and use new appliances). To understand the mechanisms through which these effects occur, we estimate the impacts on household appliance ownership and energy efficiency investments. Lastly, given that renters often do not incur the full cost of changes in electricity bills (e.g., as is common in this setting, renters often pay a fixed monthly sum to landlords that covers utility bills), we investigate heterogeneous responses by home ownership.====Transitioning to “smart grids”, electricity utilities in many countries increasingly install smart meters.==== These investments can address a number of sector challenges, including facilitating improvements in reliability (i.e., reduce frequency of outages) and power quality (i.e., eliminate fluctuations above or below a standardized voltage range).==== To do so, smart meters provide high-frequency energy readings (i.e., readings occur often) and alarms that help the utility identify and locate outages, as well as monitor for voltage fluctuations (U.S. Department of Energy, 2016). Additionally, these meters cut consumers’ grid connections when voltage drops below or spikes above the safe engineering range, protecting appliances from damage and destruction.====Estimating the relationship between electricity service quality and household outcomes is typically challenging for multiple reasons. First, service quality is often endogenous to a neighborhood. For example, utilities may target planned outages (i.e., load shedding) to neighborhoods with low rates of bill payment (see, e.g., Ali et al., 2018). Conversely, neighborhoods with powerful residents (e.g., those powerful for political, financial, or other reasons) or entities providing important services (e.g., hospitals) may be spared such outages. Second, measuring changes in outages and voltage fluctuations is difficult due to common data limitations. Utilities may not record outages and/or voltage fluctuations and, if they do, they may lack incentives to share such data. As a result, most prior economics research on electricity quality has either employed data on self-reported electricity quality or used electricity shortages as a proxy for outages. We overcome these two challenges through our study’s novel experiment and data collection processes.====In collaboration with an electricity utility, 20 neighborhoods were selected within one city. Each neighborhood receives electricity services via a transformer, the component in the distribution system that converts high-voltage electricity to usable, low-voltage electricity for household use (Glover et al., 2011). These 20 transformers, and the approximately 1600 households that they serve, were randomly assigned to treatment or control status. At the end of summer 2018, smart meters were installed at all 798 houses in the treatment group. These replaced the houses’ old meters, which did not provide two-way communication with the utility, send alerts of poor service quality events, or automatically shutdown household connections when voltage fluctuates. The control houses, 846 in total, retained their old meters. The installation of the smart meters at the specified houses was the treatment. Electricity prices remained the same across both groups during the study period.====We measure electricity service quality using multiple data sources. First, we obtain data at frequent intervals from additional smart meters installed at all transformers in the study area. These data provide objective outcome measures for both the treatment and control groups that are separate and distinct from the house-level intervention. In addition, baseline and follow-up surveys provide self-reported measures of households’ electricity service quality, as well as data on household appliances and energy efficiency investments. These datasets are complemented by utility data on monthly household billed electricity consumption.====This focus on grid improvements to improve electricity quality differs from prior economics research. In developed countries, researchers have investigated smart meters as a vehicle for other interventions, such as facilitating time-varying electricity prices or providing households with real-time information on their electricity consumption through in-home displays (see, e.g., Wolak, 2011, Jessoe and Rapson, 2014, Ito et al., 2018). In developing countries, research has addressed the impacts of metering interventions on utility finances and consumer bill payment (McRae, 2015, Jack and Smith, 2020). In our study setting, there are no changes in pricing or in-home displays to provide additional consumer information as in the former studies, nor is this a new transition from unmetered to metered consumption or a shift in the timing of bill payment (from post- to pre-payment) as in latter studies. Further, the utility did not integrate the smart meters into the billing system, so meter readers continued to both read and deliver bills throughout the study. As a result, the primary impacts expected from this intervention ex ante were electricity quality improvements.====We begin by documenting an electricity service quality improvement following the grid upgrades: the intervention led to fewer incidences of voltage fluctuations per day. We corroborate results using transformer smart meter data with additional analyses employing panel survey data. Next, we estimate the consumer responses to these service quality improvements. Treated households’ monthly billed electricity consumption significantly increased, by 50.6 kWh per month during peak demand months (November to March), when many households use electric heaters. In comparison to the baseline control group mean of 806.2 kWh per month, this increase is technically and statistically significant. Billed electricity consumption did not significantly change during off-peak months (April to October). Billed electricity consumption increased almost 5 times more among renters than homeowners, indicative of differential responses to the service quality improvements.====These increases in peak months are consistent with unmet demand prior to the intervention, followed by improved electricity service quality and greater consumption thereafter. Pre-intervention electricity quality issues occurred most frequently during months of peak demand, so these months have the room for the greatest quality improvements. Post-intervention households consume a greater quantity of electricity services during peak demand months due to electricity being available for more hours per day within the standard voltage range.====We investigate the channels through which service quality affects billed electricity consumption, as well as the heterogeneous responses by home ownership status. The increase during peak months could result from greater use of existing appliances (due to the additional hours of quality services sufficient to power those appliances) or investments in new appliances (i.e., more appliances purchased and used). We find evidence of the latter.==== Treated households’ ownership of electric heaters significantly increased after the electricity quality improvement and, consistent with the billed electricity consumption results, that increase in electric heaters was 2.4 times greater among home renters than it was among homeowners. Further, treated households were also more likely than control households to have made an energy efficiency improvement – window replacements, which can increase a building’s retention of heat in the winter. This home weatherization, in conjunction with the common residential use of electric heating, implies that the increase in peak season billed electricity consumption would have been even larger in the absence of increased energy efficiency.====The paper makes several important contributions. Broadly, this paper contributes to experimental research on the impacts of improving public service delivery in developing countries (Duflo et al., 2012, Dhaliwal and Hanna, 2017, Callen et al., 2016, Banerjee et al., 2018, Muralidharan et al., 2018) and a small body of experimental research on infrastructure service quality (Gonzalez-Navarro and Quintana-Domeque, 2016). Differences in electricity service quality are important given the low returns to electrification found in some settings (Lee et al., 2020, Burlig and Preonas, 2016), but not others (Dinkelman, 2011, Lipscomb et al., 2013, Rud, 2012, Van de Walle et al., 2013, Kassem, 2021, Meeks et al., 2021). Whereas much of this existing literature on electrification and development addresses extensive margin impacts (i.e., providing electricity to households previously with little or no access), this paper studies quality improvements on the intensive margin (i.e., additional hours of quality service, where the majority of households are already grid-connected). Further, our experimental design provides an exogenous variation in electricity quality improvements and our data collected – separating incidences of outages from voltage fluctuations – adds nuance to the discussion of electricity service quality and increases attention to voltage fluctuations, which are an understudied yet pervasive problem. By investigating energy efficiency as a channel for household response, the paper contributes to research on both the impacts of residential energy efficiency (see, e.g., Davis et al., 2014, Davis et al., 2020, Carranza and Meeks, 2021) as well as the drivers of energy efficiency investments in developing countries (Fowlie and Meeks, 2021, Beattie et al., 2022).====Beyond electricity quality, our study underscores an additional source of heterogeneity in understanding the role of electricity services in development: differential responses by home ownership. A homeowner-renter gap in electric appliance ownership and energy efficiency investments is documented in developed countries (see, e.g., Davis, 2012, Davis, 2021a), but less so in developing countries.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 explains electricity quality and demand for electricity services, as well as the role of smart meters. Section 3 details the study setting and the experimental design. Section 4 describes data sources and presents baseline checks. Section 5 presents the estimated impacts of smart meters on electricity service quality and the consumer response. Section 6 presents estimates of the returns to consumers from the electricity service quality improvements and discusses generalizing results to other settings.

We exploit a difference-in-differences strategy combining the time variation and cross-prefecture variation in waste imports before the policy change. We find that prefectures that imported waste in the prepolicy period experienced greater air quality improvements after the policy shock. This effect is stronger in regions with loose environmental regulations and poor waste utilization capacity. Further investigation shows that reductions in both the burning of unrecyclable waste and the level of industrial production are channels through which the waste import ban reduced air pollution.","The pollution haven literature has documented that pollution-intensive industries are more likely to be located in countries with lax environmental regulations.==== A more recent study (Kellenberg, 2012) notes that another channel of the pollution haven effect is direct export of physical waste byproducts to countries without stringent environmental regulations, with such waste usually traveling from developed to developing countries. Between 2011 and 2020, the world traded approximately 212 million tons of waste each year.==== Although some anecdotal evidence reveals the negative environmental consequence of importing wastes,==== systematic analysis is lacking. In this paper, we shed light on this question by investigating the effect on air pollution of China's recent 2017 policy that aimed to ban waste imports.====China used to be the largest waste importer in the world. For example, it accounted for 56% of global imports of waste plastic in 2016 (Brooks et al., 2018). However, concerns have been raised about environmental consequences due to improper waste processing. Faced with the challenge of a deteriorating environment, the Chinese government has taken several measures, including the banning of waste imports in 2017. This policy led to a dramatic drop in waste imports (additional details are provided in Section 2). This scenario enables us to exploit the difference-in-differences (DID) strategy for identification. Utilizing a unique administrative dataset on waste imports in 2015 and 2016 (enabling us to compute the import quantity for each prefecture before the policy change) and air quality monitoring data, we find that the waste import ban significantly reduced local air pollution levels as measured by the air quality index (AQI), the concentration of suspended particulates smaller than 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter (====), and the concentration of suspended particulates smaller than 10 μm in aerodynamic diameter (====). Specifically, for prefectures with preban waste imports, the waste import ban policy led to a 4.4% greater decrease in the AQI, a 6.5% greater decrease in the ==== concentration and a 5.6% greater decrease in the ==== concentration. This effect is stronger in prefectures with less stringent environmental regulations and lower waste processing capacity.====We conduct several tests to check the validity of our DID identification strategy. First, we perform an event study–style test to show that prefectures in the treatment and control groups experienced a similar evolution in air pollution before the policy, providing evidence that the parallel trend assumption holds in our paper. Second, we show that our main results are not driven by other concurrent policies and omitted heterogeneity across cities. Third, to address the potential concern that the observed effects may be attributable purely to chance, we adopt a randomization inference approach analogous to Fisher permutation tests (Rosenbaum, 2002); the results show that our estimated effects are not due to chance. We also show that our main results are robust across different samples.====We then explore the underlying channels through which reducing waste imports improves local air quality. Imported waste can be divided into an unrecyclable portion that cannot be used as industrial material and is ultimately discarded and a recyclable portion that can be put into industrial production. The unrecyclable portion is usually poorly sorted in the home countries and contains large amounts of garbage. Anecdotal evidence shows that garbage is often burned into the air without proper treatment.==== To proxy open waste burning, we resort to the satellite fire data collected by NASA's Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and show that the waste import ban has indeed resulted in fewer fire points detected by the satellite. This finding suggests that reducing the occurrence of the open burning of imported garbage is a channel through which waste import bans improve air quality. Second, given that a portion of the imported waste can be recycled and used as inputs for industrial production, the imported waste can cause more pollution by the scale effect (whereby more production leads to more pollution). We find that the waste import ban reduced the value added of the secondary industry. Furthermore, using matched data on waste imports, industrial firms' production activities, and firms' emissions from the prepolicy period, we find that firms that import more waste have higher production levels and firms with higher production levels emit more waste gas. This finding suggests that the waste import ban could reduce pollution by making firms produce less overall. One caveat is that this production channel is likely to be short term because firms could replace inputs from recycled wastes with others in the long term and thus return to their initial level of output.====Finally, we provide a back-of-envelope estimation of the monetized health benefits of the air quality improvements due to the waste import ban policy. Our calculation shows that the monetized benefits brought about by the waste import ban policy to the treated prefectures total at least $6.67 billion.====Our paper contributes to the literature in the following ways. First, it contributes to the growing literature linking the fields of environmental and international economics. Past studies have focused on how domestic environmental policies affect international trade or foreign direct investment (FDI) (see, for example, Cai et al. (2016) and Shi and Xu (2018)). A small but growing number of studies pay attention to how trade policy affects the environment (Fowlie et al., 2016; Duan et al., 2021; Shapiro, 2021). As Copeland (1994) argues, when efficient environmental policies are unavailable, the environmental pollution stemming from trade cannot be effectively adjusted by domestic environmental regulation; in such a case, trade policy can be used as a second-best environmental policy to fix the environmental issue. However, most of this research relies on theoretical or simulation analysis.==== By exploiting a large-scale reform (restricting waste imports) in the largest developing country and showing the effectiveness of such a ban in improving domestic air quality, our paper provides empirical evidence that trade policy can act as an environmental policy.====Second, our paper enriches the evaluation of environmental policies and their health benefits. The number of studies examining environmental policies in developing countries has increased in recent years due to the improvement of environmental regulations in developing countries and better access to pollution data (for example, Davis, 2008; Shi and Xu, 2018; He et al., 2020; Greenstone et al., 2020, 2021). While a large share of these studies focus exclusively on domestic environmental policies that target environmental issues themselves, our paper shows that trade policy can play a role as another form of environmental policy. In particular, our calculations of the health benefits resulting from the waste import ban contribute to the literature on the health effects of environmental policies (see, for example, He et al. (2020) and Rangel and Vogl (2019)). Our study aids in the evaluation of the health improvement impact of such policies.====Third, our paper contributes to the literature on the pollution haven hypothesis (PHH). The PHH predicts that countries with lax environmental regulations have comparative advantages regarding pollution-intensive industries and therefore are more likely to export products produced by these industries, which are expected to negatively affect the environment. Despite the available analytical theories on trade's influence on the environment (for example, Copeland and Taylor, 1994, 1995; Benarroch and Gaisford, 2014; Kreickemeier and Richter, 2014), the empirical evidence is mixed (Grossman and Krueger, 1993; Antweiler et al., 2001; Frankel and Rose, 2005; Levinson, 2009; Roy, 2017; Shapiro and Walker, 2018).==== In addition, Kellenberg (2012) documents a novel channel of the pollution haven effect whereby countries with lax environmental regulations are also more likely to import waste. Our paper differs from the traditional literature on the PHH by examining the environmental consequences of this channel, thereby enhancing our understanding of the pollution haven effect.====Fourth, and more specifically, our paper enriches the research on waste trading. Despite the large amount of global waste trading and the potential related environmental impacts, the available research on this topic is surprisingly minimal (Kellenberg, 2015), except for the few studies on the determinants of waste imports (Baggs, 2009; Kellenberg, 2012).==== However, how waste trade affects the environment, particularly for importing countries, remains unclear. Our paper fills this gap by investigating how waste imports affect a destination country's air pollution. Moreover, we exploit a policy shock as a natural experiment and therefore offer more reliable estimates of the plausibly causal relationship between waste imports and air pollution.====The remainder of this paper is divided into the following sections. Section 2 provides background. Section 3 introduces the data and empirical strategy. Section 4 presents the baseline results, heterogeneity analysis results, and results from several robustness checks. Section 5 investigates the underlying mechanisms. Section 6 calculates the monetized health benefits brought by the waste import ban policy, and Section 7 concludes the paper.",Waste import and air pollution: Evidence from China's waste import ban,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069623000554,Available online 5 June 2023,2023,Research Article,2.0

We exploit the progressive implementation of a national program in China that introduces more comprehensive air pollution monitoring and provides real-time air-pollution information to the public. The program leads to a sharp increase in public awareness and attention to air pollution issues and results in a large increase in the sensitivity of individual’s mental health to changes in air quality, especially among those with more exposure to pollution information and those more susceptible to mental illnesses. Information of worsening air quality has a direct effect on mental health as a source of stressors and an indirect behavioral effect through reducing outdoor activities and ====. Our findings shed light on the design and delivery of environmental information disclosure programs, especially for countries with pressing environmental threats.","With rising attention to environmental safety, immense amounts of environmental information are now accessible to the public. Information disclosure policies are increasingly being used as an effective tool to promote public supervision and engagement in environmental protection in diverse areas, including water safety, greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, radiation, and climate change (see, for example, Bennear and Olmstead, 2008, Neidell, 2009, Deschenes et al., 2017; and Greenstone and Jack (2015)).==== An important research agenda is to understand the role of environmental information in shaping individual’s awareness, cognition, decision-making, mental well-being, and overall welfare in response to environmental risks. Recent literature has established that the disclosure of environmental information mitigates exposure to environmental hazards, increases willingness to pay (WTP) for means of avoidance, and reduces the mortality and morbidity burden of environmental risks (Chay and Greenstone, 2005, Bennear and Olmstead, 2008, Barwick et al., 2019, Freeman et al., 2019, Ito and Zhang, 2020, Tu et al., 2020, Deschenes et al., 2017). Yet much less is known about the role of environmental information in shaping individual’s mental well-being, especially in countries with deteriorating environmental quality.====We aim to fill this gap in knowledge by investigate whether the public disclosure of real-time information on air pollution changes the way individuals respond mentally to air pollution. Specifically, we estimate the causal impact of air pollution on individual’s mental health in periods before and after the information on local pollution levels is readily disclosed, and investigate whether the information disclosure changes – reduces or magnifies – the pollution’s impact on mental health. We then study the underlying mechanisms for this change.====China’s recent real-time monitoring and disclosure program for air pollution provides the empirical setting for this study. Air pollution is a major environmental challenge for China, which is one of the most polluted countries in the world. In 2010, China’s annual concentration of a primary air pollutant – fine particulate matters with a diameter of 2.5 ==== or less (PM2.5) – was over 60 ====, five times higher than the World Health Organization’s safety standard (World Health Organization, 2005). Air pollution is the fifth leading risk factor for all-cause mortality in China and caused 1.1 million deaths in 2015 (Forouzanfar et al., 2016). Yet, a national system for monitoring and reporting air pollution was nonexistent before the 2010s. Amid a rising outcry over the lack of air-pollution information (Ghanem and Zhang, 2014, Greenstone et al., 2022), the government launched a nationwide program in 2013 to undertake real-time monitoring and automated reporting of air pollution (henceforth, the information program). The program was implemented progressively across cities and covered 98% of China’s population by the end of 2016. The comprehensive population coverage and the progressive roll-out provide an ideal empirical setting to study the impact of such a sharp and permanent increase in pollution information on various behavioral and mental responses to air pollution.====Our empirical strategy exploits two sources of exogenous variations. First, we take advantage of the progressive roll-out schedule of the information program across different cities in a general difference-in-differences design. Second, we adopt thermal inversions as the instrumental variable for air pollution to elicit the causal impact of air pollution on mental health both before and after the information program. Essentially, we take advantage of the sharp and staggered roll-out of the information program to investigate whether there exists a “break” in the marginal effect of air pollution on mental health after the information program. In the language of Barwick et al. (2019), we refer to the marginal effect of air pollution on mental health as the ==== of mental health to air pollution, and study whether and how such a gradient changes when information on air pollution becomes readily available.====We provide robust evidence that the disclosure of real-time information on air pollution has significantly increased the gradient of mental health to air pollution. The introduction of the information program has more than doubled this gradient. This pattern is more pronounced for individuals with better access to pollution information, for those with more susceptibility to mental illnesses, and for those living in cities with little prior information on local air quality. While previous literature has documented that information can ==== the impact of environmental threats on individual’s ==== health through facilitating avoidance, our finding highlights that such information can also ==== the impact of environmental threats on individual’s ==== health.====We find a potential awareness-alertness-stress pathway through which the disclosure of pollution information may lead to a greater gradient of mental health to air pollution. We explain in three steps. First, the provision of real-time pollution information has increased public ==== of the severity of local pollution levels as well as the health damages of air pollution. As a direct sign of awareness, the intensity of active online searches for air pollution, health impact of air pollution, and defensive measures against air pollution, all significantly increased in response to an increase in pollution levels. Second, this increased awareness of the severity and harms of local air pollution would naturally make individuals more ==== to the fluctuations in air pollution (Chun et al., 2011, Gottlieb, 2012). Third, with higher alertness and attention, information on a worsening air quality is more likely to register in the mental system and trigger a series of stress responses, such as anxiety and sleep disturbance (Miller et al., 2016, Thomson, 2019, Braithwaite et al., 2019, Li et al., 2017). The physiology and neuroscience literature shows that an accumulation of such stress responses can cause constant wear and tear on the body and the mental system, and result in a higher risk of both short- and long-term physical and mental disorders (Juster et al., 2010, McEwen, 2000, McEwen, 2012). Indeed, individuals who lived in regions that exhibited a larger increase in pollution-related search activities experienced a greater increase in stress and depressive responses to air pollution. In addition, the increase in the gradient of mental health to air pollution became more pronounced when an episode of bad air quality persisted for a longer time, suggesting an accumulation of stress responses over time.====The second driving factor of the greater gradient of mental health to air pollution is avoidance behaviors. Consistent with prior studies, we find that individuals are more likely to reduce the frequency of physical exercises, social activities with relatives, friends, and neighbors, and other outdoor activities after being more informed of the severity of air pollution. These avoidance behaviors, however, may generate mental health burdens. Physical exercise and social activities have been shown to have substantial protective effects on mental health (Kleppang et al., 2018, Chan et al., 2019, Doré et al., 2016, Seeman, 1996, Kaplan et al., 2012, Lecerof et al., 2015). The greater gradient of avoidance behaviors to air pollution also leads to more disrupted daily routines and reduced social integration, which may contribute to a greater gradient of mental health to air pollution. In addition, the information program has led to a substantial increase in the gradient of defensive expenditure to air pollution, such as in purchasing air purifiers (Barwick et al., 2019, Ito and Zhang, 2020).==== While such an increase in defensive expenditure reflects a greater WTP for air quality, it may also lead to an increase in the financial burden and stress.====Our findings are in line with the general hypothesis that information has a direct impact on individual’s mental health====; and that environmental information played a role in shaping individual’s response to environmental threats. However, our results do not imply that the overall welfare effects of the information program are negative. Such calculation would require estimating the effects along various other dimensions. In this respect, our estimates complement recent findings of Barwick et al. (2019) and Ito and Zhang (2020), who quantify the positive effects of the information program on individual’s physical health and WTP through pollution avoidance behaviors and defensive expenditure during the same period. In addition, considering that air quality improved substantially after the information program, our estimates implies that the information program led to additional welfare gains through an improvement in mental health. A back-of-envelope calculation suggests that the information program led to additional saving on direct medical spending for depression of $3.36 billion per year when national concentration of PM2.5 dropped from the 2013 level to the 2016 level.==== Should the level of PM2.5 drop to the WHO guideline limit (10 ====), the estimated additional saving on depression treatment alone would amount to $12 billion per year.====Our findings are informative to policymakers, especially in countries with pressing environmental threats. Our findings show that the provision of environmental information may be a double-edge sword: It raises the ==== of mental health to air pollution, and the change in the ==== of individual’s mental health depends on the change in air pollution levels. In the case of deteriorating environmental quality, public disclosure of such information may create unintended mental health burdens on the population; on the other hand, when the environmental quality is improving, the public disclosure may lead to an improvement in mental health. Therefore, the design and implementation of an information disclosure program may take into account the general trend of environmental quality and should be implemented along with programs of pollution control and environmental protection.====Our study contributes to the literature on the impacts of air pollution on the risk of mental illness and subjective well-being. Recent studies in psychology and neuroscience have shown that exposure to air pollution, especially the particulate matters (PMs), may severely harm the central nervous system (Ross et al., 2018, Mehta et al., 2015, Thomson, 2019) and increase the risk of anxiety and depression (Pun et al., 2017, Power et al., 2015). The economic literature shows that the mental health play a critical role in explaining the large adverse effect of air pollution on individuals’ subjective well-being (Zhang et al., 2017, Levinson, 2012). However, little research has considered the role of pollution information in shaping the relationship between air pollution and mental health. Our study aims to fill this gap in knowledge.====Our study reconciles an important discrepancy in estimates of the gradient of mental health to air pollution. Such a discrepancy exists between countries as well as across time periods within the same country (Greenstone and Jack, 2015, Greenstone et al., 2021). For example, Chen et al. (2018b) estimate a much larger gradient of mental illness to air pollution than Xue et al. (2019), whereas both studies use the same nationally representative data from China, but cover different sample periods. Our study shows that the disclosure of accurate, easily accessible information on air pollution could explain an important part of this discrepancy. In particular, the disclosure of air-pollution information since 2013 can reconcile the larger gradient of mental health to air pollution estimated by Chen et al. (2018b) (based on post-information-program data) and the smaller gradient by Xue et al. (2019) (based on pre-information-program data).====Our study also complements the literature that evaluates the impact of information provision on compensatory responses to pollution exposure. Previous studies have substantiated the effects of environmental information disclosure in shaping decision-making, including having higher WTP for defensive devices and housing with better air quality (Chay and Greenstone, 2005, Freeman et al., 2019, Ito and Zhang, 2020, Deschenes et al., 2017, Tu et al., 2020); adjusting consumption and travel patterns to reduce exposure (Sun et al., 2019, Neidell, 2009, Barwick et al., 2019); reducing labor supply (Graff Zivin and Neidell, 2012, Hanna and Oliva, 2015, Borgschulte et al., 2018); and moving to locations with better air quality (Qin and Zhu, 2018). Our paper adds to this burgeoning strand of research by delineating the important role of pollution information in shaping the mental health response to environmental risks, and find that environmental information amplifies the impact of environmental amenity or adversity on individual’s mental well-being. Moreover, many forms of avoidance responses to pollution exposure, such as reducing outdoor leisure activities, changing consumption patterns, and reducing social activities, may generate unintended mental-health effects.====Finally, our study provides a new perspective to the emerging literature that quantifies the social welfare effects of pollution information disclosure in developing countries, and China in particular. Several studies have evaluated the welfare effects of the 2013 information program in China and documented substantial social benefits in terms of improving regulation of local polluters (Deng and Axbard, 2021), reducing strategic underreporting of pollution levels (Greenstone et al., 2022), raising public awareness on pollution, mitigating harms of pollution exposure, and raising WTP for defensive measures (Barwick et al., 2019, Ito and Zhang, 2020). We document an under-studied effect of the information program through the lens of mental health. Our results suggest the need to account for mental health effects of public disclosure of environmental risks and the need for a proper deliver of information on environmental risks, especially for developing countries in which environmental threats are severe and rising and households may lack effective defensive measures.====We proceed as follows. Section 2 describes the institutional background of the public disclosure of air-pollution information in China. Section 3 describes the data sources and key variables. Section 4 presents our empirical methodology, baseline results, and robustness checks. Section 5 discusses the mechanism. Section 6 considers the welfare implications and Section 7 concludes.","Information, awareness, and mental health: Evidence from air pollution disclosure in China",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069623000451,30 May 2023,2023,Research Article,3.0

Our analysis is conducted in terms of an infinite-horizon differential game (with either open-loop or feedback strategies). We derive two main results, in contrast with previous studies on the topic. First, we show that there exists a unique state-independent efficiency-inducing industry size, ranging between 1 and infinity, if and only if the elasticity of the price-cost margin (capturing static market power) and the elasticity of the difference between social and private resource rents (capturing the tragedy of the commons) are the same. Second, allowing for entry/exit, we show that the regulator can set a license fee to be paid by firms to get access to the resource such that the endogenous number of firms in the equilibrium with regulated entry is socially optimal.","In this paper, we inquire about the optimal number of resource users in common-pool resource industries, under the assumption that resource users are profit-maximizing firms which sell the extracted resource in the marketplace (or use the extracted resource as an input in the production of homogeneous goods to be sold in the marketplace). The two key features of common-pool resource industries are the ==== and the ==== nature of firms’ optimization problem. Indeed, in deciding how much of the resource to extract from the ground, each firm has to take into account not only the opportunity cost of extracting an extra unit of resource, but also the reaction of rival firms to a change in the resource stock. In order to deal with both the intertemporal and the strategic aspects of common-pool resource industries, we study a dynamic (continuous-time) oligopoly game of exploitation of a common-pool resource, with firms competing in quantities (à la Cournot) over an infinite time horizon. We are interested in characterizing the efficiency-inducing industry size, i.e., the number of firms that makes the oligopoly equilibrium coincide with the social optimum. The focus of our analysis is on oligopoly exploitation of common-pool non-renewable resources, such as oil reservoirs, slowly recharging groundwater aquifers (geological formations that store water), and rare earth metals.==== A detailed discussion of practical cases where our analysis is relevant is provided in Section 2.====Traditionally, two sources of inefficiency have been identified in the literature on common-pool resource industries (e.g., Dasgupta and Heal, 1979, Kemp and Long, 1980, Cornes and Sandler, 1983, Reinganum and Stokey, 1985, Cornes and Mason, 1986, Mason et al., 1988, Karp, 1992a, Karp, 1992b, Mason and Polasky, 2002, Benchekroun, 2003, Benchekroun, 2008, Colombo and Labrecciosa, 2015, Colombo and Labrecciosa, 2018, Benchekroun et al., 2020), namely, market power, which refers to the ability of a firm to raise the price above the marginal cost for a given resource stock, and the so-called ”tragedy of the commons”, which refers to the fact that private and social incentives to conserve the resource differ.==== Intuitively, there exists a trade-off between market power and the tragedy of the commons: as the number of firms increases, market power decreases and the tragedy of the commons increases.====To the best of our knowledge, there are only a few papers addressing the issue of the optimal number of firms in the commons. Cornes and Mason (1986) and Mason et al. (1988), by using a static approach, derive an expression for the optimal number of firms exploiting a common-pool resource when the resulting output is sold in an imperfectly competitive market. They show that the optimum number of firms depends directly on the elasticity of the input productivity and inversely on the price elasticity of the market demand. Karp (1992a), by using a dynamic (continuous-time) oligopoly game of exploitation of a non-renewable common-pool resource, shows that the optimal industry size is equal to either 1 (if the common-property aspects dominate) or infinity (if the oligopoly aspects dominate). More precisely, Karp (1992a), Proposition 3), shows that the discounted social welfare associated with the oligopoly equilibrium is an increasing function of the number of firms in the industry when the resource stock is sufficiently large, and a decreasing function of the number of firms in the industry when the resource stock is sufficiently small. Mason and Polasky (1997) focus, instead, on common-pool renewable resources, and show that the socially optimal steady-state industry size is intermediate. Moreover, they show that the optimal industry size typically changes over time, so that a first-best outcome cannot be obtained with a fixed number of firms.====The paper closest to ours is Karp (1992a). Unlike Karp (1992a), who considers a state-independent extraction cost, we assume that the extraction cost is state-dependent (a decreasing function of the resource stock).==== Moreover, while Karp (1992a) derives the discounted social welfare associated with the oligopoly equilibrium and investigates how it is affected by the number of firms in the industry (without considering the social planner’s solution), we seek the number of firms in the industry such that the oligopoly equilibrium coincides with the first-best solution. As such, our solution is not directly comparable to that in Karp (1992a).====We make a new point in the literature. Specifically, by using the price-cost margin to capture (static) market power and the difference between the social and the private shadow prices of the resource to capture the ”tragedy of the commons”, we show that there exists an optimal (i.e., efficiency inducing) industry size, ====, that is ====, ranging between 1 and infinity, and ==== over time (i.e. state-independent), if and only if the elasticity of the market power and the elasticity of the tragedy of the commons are the same. In this case, the first-best outcome can be achieved with a fixed number of firms in the industry. Irrespective of the value of the state variable (stock of a non-renewable resource in the ground), an oligopoly of size ==== will choose the same output level as the social planner would choose.====Our analysis is conducted by using the apparatus of differential games (see Dockner et al., 2000, Long, 2010, Haurie et al., 2012). We consider both open-loop and feedback (a.k.a. Markovian) equilibria. In the former, firms simultaneously commit themselves to entire time paths of harvesting rules at the beginning of the game, taking as given the time paths of the harvesting rules of the rivals. In the latter, each firm chooses a harvesting rule (taking as given the strategies of the rivals), which takes the form of a decision rule based on time and the current state variable. We derive the optimal industry size under the two information structures, showing that, due to the presence of a positive feedback effect in the feedback equilibrium, aggregate extraction is higher in the feedback than in the open-loop equilibrium, implying a lower optimal number of firms in the former than in the latter.====After considering the number of firms as exogenously given, we allow for entry/exit. We assume that each firm, before exploitation begins, must pay a fixed cost to be interpreted as a license fee chosen by the regulator. Entry occurs as long as the value function exceeds the licence fee, and stops when the difference between the discounted sum of profits and the licence fee is driven to zero. The endogenous number of firms in the equilibrium with regulated entry is generally different from the optimal number of firms. However, we show that it is possible for the regulator to set a license fee such that the equilibrium number of firms coincides with the socially optimal one, thus achieving the first-best outcome.====The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows.

We conducted a pre-registered incentivized online experiment with a sample of 769 UK residents to better understand solidarity behavior framed in the context of flooding. In the experiment, participants make costly adaptation decisions that reduce their own risk of endowment loss. Moreover, they can make solidarity transfers to affected partners if unaffected themselves. Participants are matched with a partner who takes adaptation decisions, too. We experimentally vary the adaptation costs of the partner to be either the same (control condition) or heterogenous (known or uncertain). In the control condition, participants show less solidarity with non-adapted partners than with adapted ones. On average, the heterogenous adaptation cost treatments do not significantly affect observed solidarity transfers. Explorative analyses indicate, however, that differences in transfers to adapted and non-adapted partners are mediated by one's adaptation behavior. Under known heterogenous adaptation costs, risk-averse players (who adapted themselves) show as much solidarity with adapted as with non-adapted partners. Overall, the results suggest that information about adaptation cost heterogeneity may promote solidarity after exogenous shocks when people cannot easily adapt proactively.","Extreme weather events cause enormous damage, forcing more and more people, communities, and countries to adapt to a changing environment. Climate change amplifies extreme events like heatwaves, droughts, or floods (IPCC et al., 2022; Stott, 2016), threatening global well-being (IPCC et al., 2022). Even though the capacity to invest in physical infrastructure to minimize vulnerabilities, as well as formal insurance and government support are all widely available in high-income countries, dealing with and recovering from climate hazards also crucially depends on informal social support networks (Aldrich and Meyer, 2015; Hsueh, 2019).====Previous experimental research indicates that people show less solidarity with individuals who are affected by exogenous shocks when the affected individuals deliberately took risks (Cettolin and Tausch, 2015; Trhal and Radermacher, 2009) or forwent to reduce risks (Anderberg and Morsink, 2020; Lenel and Steiner, 2020; Lin et al., 2014). This literature predominantly relates to (health) insurance uptake or entrepreneurial risks in low- and middle-income countries. These experimental findings suggest that solidarity with individuals exposed to climate hazards may be lower if no precautionary measures were taken to reduce their vulnerability. We will refer to this vulnerability reduction in the following as adaptation. For example, homeowners exposed to flood risks could invest in structural reinforcements for their houses.====Adaptation costs typically vary between individuals, for example, due to differences in geographic location, such as living closer to a river – resulting in different degrees of vulnerability to climate hazards (Kelman, 2020). To what extent heterogeneity in adaptation costs affect post-hazard solidarity has – to our knowledge – not been investigated experimentally so far. To fill this gap, we report the results of an online experiment conducted with 769 UK residents. We conjecture that individuals perceive losses that followed no adaptation as less self-inflicted if the victim faced high adaptation costs, thus having made adaptation more difficult. Hence, we expect cost heterogeneity to increase solidarity with non-adapted individuals. However, adaptation costs and capabilities are often unknown to other community members or can only be eyeballed. Therefore, in one experimental treatment, we incorporate uncertainty by not explicitly revealing individual adaptation costs to others. This allows us to test to what extent uncertainty regarding other's adaptation costs affects solidarity.====Our underlying experimental design further includes several critical differences to prior work that are relevant for studying solidarity responses to climate hazards. First, unlike idiosyncratic shocks associated with health or entrepreneurial risks, climate hazards are covariate shocks that typically affect a group of people. In some prior experiments, the solidarity provider is not exposed to any risk (Anderberg and Morsink, 2020; Lenel and Steiner, 2020), or it is guaranteed that only one of two persons in a group will be exposed to the exogenous shock (Lin et al., 2014). Second, participants in our experiment can only partially reduce their risk of endowment loss through adaptation. In other studies, participants can fully insure, reducing the risk of harm (Anderberg and Morsink, 2020; Lenel and Steiner, 2020; Trhal and Radermacher, 2009) or not winning (Lin et al., 2014) to zero. These design differences allow assessing whether findings from existing experiments also apply to a design that captures the covariate shock nature of most climate hazards.====Our paper also contributes to a larger body of experimental research on climate change risks. In so-called collective-risk social dilemmas a group of individuals faces a collective risk of losses that can be avoided through contributions to a public good (e.g., typically framed as climate change mitigation). Such studies have focused on asymmetric endowments and capabilities to contribute to the public good (Milinski et al., 2011, Tavoni et al., 2011), and asymmetric risk exposure (Burton-Chellew et al., 2013). Other studies have explicitly incorporated the possibility of public and private risk reduction strategies (Blanco et al., 2020; Gross and Böhm, 2020; Gross and Dreu, 2019).",Solidarity under heterogenous adaptation costs: Experimental evidence on coping after climate hazards,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069623000426,8 May 2023,2023,Research Article,5.0

However, concerns about the lack of a formal ==== strategy to deal with omitted farmland characteristics have raised doubts about the identification of such impacts. This paper proposes an original method for estimating Ricardian models with plot fixed effects to control for confounding omitted variables. Specifically, we use plot-level repeat-sales French data from 1996 to 2019 to investigate how differences in farmland prices between two sale dates are explained by differences in climate evolutions. We show that our repeat-Ricardian estimates suggest greater benefits of climate change than those found with standard Ricardian analyses. In particular, our repeat-Ricardian estimates indicate that warmer summers benefit French agriculture, in complete opposition to our pooled Ricardian estimates or to the remainder of the literature. Our repeat-Ricardian results are robust to several specifications, climate length-definitions and sub-samples. We provide elements suggesting that the repeat-Ricardian analysis is better able to capture crop-switching towards high-value crops requiring particular soil conditions (e.g. vineyards). Our repeat-Ricardian analysis also indicates greater benefits of climate change compared to those estimated with short-term weather-based approaches, shedding new lights on previous inconsistent findings from the literature.","Climate change threatens the rise of agricultural yields and the profitability of agriculture (Moore and Lobell, 2015). Farmers are however likely to adapt to such change. Mendelsohn et al. (1994) proposed a simple way to value the impacts of climate change on agriculture while taking into account farmers’ adaptation: to regress farmland values on climate conditions. Indeed, because farmland values reflect the discounted stream of future rents once all potential adaptation strategies have been implemented (e.g changes in capital or crop allocation), such regressions are supposed to provide the long-term value of climate for agriculture. Empirically, the so-called Ricardian analysis is a cross-sectional hedonic pricing analysis exploiting differences in farmland prices and climate conditions across locations. The Ricardian analysis has been applied in about fifty countries with consistent results across studies (Mendelsohn and Massetti, 2017). For example, the large bulk of the Ricardian literature identifies beneficial effects of warmer springs and autumns but harmful effects of hotter summers and winters (Massetti and Mendelsohn, 2011, Van Passel et al., 2017). It also agrees on the fact that all these seasonal impacts together are likely to be slightly beneficial for agriculture in high latitude regions – such as the US or Europe – but harmful in low latitude regions (Mendelsohn and Massetti, 2017). However, concerns about the lack of ability to account for omitted variables in the Ricardian analysis have shed doubts on these estimates (Deschênes and Greenstone, 2007, Ortiz-Bobea, 2020). This weakness has led more recent studies to exploit weather fluctuations with panel econometrics methods (Blanc and Schlenker, 2017), regressing agricultural profits (or yields) on weather and individual fixed effects. While this approach has the advantage of purging the estimates of the influence of omitted time-invariant characteristics, the literature considers that the panel approach only accounts for farmers’ ==== adaptation, both because it only accounts for adaptation occurring during a particular year and because weather fluctuations differ from real climate changes (Dell et al., 2014, Kolstad and Moore, 2020).==== Compared to the Ricardian analysis, the panel approach is thus likely to overestimate the costs of climate change.====In this paper, we propose a new method for estimating Ricardian models. Using plot-level repeat-sales data, we examine across plots how changes in farmland prices between two sales are explained by differences in climate over a similar period (i.e. changes of seasonal temperature and precipitation averages over several years). Such a “repeat-Ricardian” analysis combines the advantages of both methods: accounting for long-term adaptation thanks to the use of farmland prices – as in standard Ricardian analyses – while controlling for confounding omitted variables with individual (plot) fixed effects (as in the panel approach). The introduction of plot fixed effects into the Ricardian framework allows us to limit omitted variable biases in an original way. Indeed, the usual practice in previous Ricardian studies has been to include numerous control variables. However, measurements of these variables are usually not available at the plot level but rather at aggregated levels (e.g. at the municipal and departmental levels in France). Such aggregated data hides a large remaining heterogeneity within the aggregation unit. This is particularly true for soil conditions, as they can be very spatially heterogeneous over space, even within a municipality (Ay, 2021). Consequently, the inclusion of aggregated-level controls does not necessarily overcome the omitted variable bias, and can even add measurement errors on top (Auffhammer et al., 2013). Because most of these variables are, however, fixed over time, the inclusion of plot fixed effects in the repeat-Ricardian analysis is likely to purge the estimates of their confounding influence.====To illustrate the interest of our approach, we estimate our repeat-Ricardian model on the set of farmland plots that were sold twice between 1996 and 2019 in France (8,614 transactions), and ==== the obtained estimates to those obtained with standard pooled Ricardian models on ==== repeat sales. The data comes from PERVAL, a notarial database compiling information on ==== real-estate transactions that have occurred in France since 1996. Our data has several advantages beyond its repeat-sales content. First, using observed transactions rather than the self-reported farmland values that are commonly used in the Ricardian literature should provide more reliable estimates of the value of climate (Bigelow and Jodlowski, 2023). Second, using individual instead of aggregated data – as commonly used in the Ricardian literature – allows us to avoid aggregation biases (Fezzi and Bateman, 2015). Third, these observations exhibit statistically similar prices to the other plots sold in France between 1996 and 2019. They also display no particular characteristics regarding other observed features (e.g. plot size, location, climate change). Our results are thus likely to represent consistent estimates of the impacts of climate change on French agriculture.====The source of identification of the value of climate in the repeat-Ricardian analysis is the exploitation of heterogeneous changes in climate conditions over time and space. France experienced such heterogeneous climate changes between 1996 and 2019: although some municipalities faced seasonal temperature reductions as great as −1.10 °C, most municipalities experienced increases in seasonal temperatures, up to ====2.40 °C (see Table 1). Precipitation changes were even more heterogeneous during the period. The identification strategy of the repeat-Ricardian analysis thus does not solely rely on ==== heterogeneity in climate and farmland prices across locations as in standard Ricardian analyses, but exploits both their ==== and ==== heterogeneity. Doing so, our repeat-Ricardian analysis shares some similarities with the “long-differences” approach that measures the impacts of long-term climate variations – not solely weather variations – on economic outcomes (Dell et al., 2012, Burke and Emerick, 2016).====The results of our repeat-Ricardian analysis suggests that climate change is likely to benefit agriculture. While this conclusion has already been highlighted in previous Ricardian studies (e.g. Mendelsohn et al., 1994), our analysis suggests much higher positive impacts of climate change than previously estimated. We show that, compared to our repeat-Ricardian estimates, the use of standard pooled Ricardian estimates obtained from similar data leads to an underestimation of the positive impacts of IPCC’s climate change scenarios on French agriculture by a factor between two and twenty for the period 2070–2099. This large difference is essentially explained by the fact that our repeat-Ricardian analysis identifies ==== of warmer summers on farmland prices. To our knowledge, such a result differs from the large bulk of the literature that has concluded that warmer summers will negatively impact farmland values. Such a typical result is also found in our data when estimating pooled Ricardian models. The difference in the estimated impacts of summer temperatures between our standard and repeat-Ricardian analyses is thus not due to our particular dataset (as we estimate the two models on the same sample), but really to a difference in identification strategies. Such a difference is supported by several robustness checks (e.g. alternative climate length-definitions, sub-sample analyses). The repeat-Ricardian estimates are in fact remarkably robust to the inclusion of control variables and changes in specifications, which represents a sharp difference from standard Ricardian analyses (Schlenker et al., 2005, Deschênes and Greenstone, 2007, Ortiz-Bobea, 2020), and suggests that plot fixed effects control for most of the confounding impacts of unobserved farmland characteristics.====The difference between the estimated climate impacts in the pooled and repeat-Ricardian approaches is striking. This suggests that plot fixed effects capture high correlations of particular omitted plot characteristics – or that are difficult to measure at the plot level – with changes in climate and farmland values (e.g. soil quality or slope). In particular, the positive impacts of summer temperatures could imply that the repeat-Ricardian analysis is better able to capture crop switching towards high-value crops that benefit from warmer summers and require particular plot characteristics. To further support this interpretation, we demonstrate that vineyards have recently expanded in French regions that experienced a rise in summer temperatures. Although the expansion in vineyard areas remains limited, such growth in warmer regions is in line with the plausible impact of plot fixed effects in the repeat-Ricardian analysis.====This paper contributes to three strands of the literature. First, we extend previous attempts at estimating Ricardian models with panel econometric methods by using fixed effects at the plot level. Indeed, while the first Ricardian studies exploited cross-sectional differences across locations, more recent efforts have taken advantage of the panel structure of the data. In particular, several studies have estimated pooled Ricardian models (Schlenker et al., 2006, Deschênes and Greenstone, 2007, Massetti and Mendelsohn, 2011, Bozzola et al., 2018). Others have estimated random effects models to account for unobserved heterogeneity (Fezzi and Bateman, 2015, Vaitkeviciute et al., 2019). However, pooled and random effects approaches do not address the issue of omitted variable bias associated with unobserved time-invariant factors. Only the use of individual fixed effects would remove such bias (Wooldridge, 2015). To our knowledge, our study is the first to estimate Ricardian models with individual (plot) fixed effects. Our results suggest that, despite the inclusion of numerous controls in Ricardian estimations, remaining omitted farmland characteristics lead to large bias in the assessment of the costs of climate change for agriculture.====Second, we contribute to the hedonic literature by providing the first repeat-sales assessment of the value of climate. Because of the difficulty of constructing a panel of repeat sales, such analyses are scarce in the literature. The hedonic literature has however established that using multiple sales of the same good over time allows for better control of unobserved heterogeneity and provides more accurate estimates (Bishop et al., 2020, Banzhaf, 2021). Despite this insight, repeat sales of farmland have rarely been exploited in the literature (never in the Ricardian literature). To our knowledge, Buck et al. (2014) is the single hedonic study using repeated farmland sales. Motivated by the measurement of water value, Buck et al. show that previous cross-sectional and pooled analyses suffer from omitted variable bias despite the inclusion of numerous – aggregated-level – control variables. They show in particular that including plot fixed effects provides significantly higher estimates than cross-sectional and pooled estimates. In line with Buck et al. (2014), we show that accounting for multiple sales of the same plots over time leads to estimates that are statistically distinct from those obtained with standard pooled analyses.====Third, we contribute to the debates on differences between the long- and short-term responses to climate change (Burke and Emerick, 2016, Merel and Gammans, 2021). Indeed, the literature considers that, due to its long-term nature, the Ricardian analysis should theoretically yield lower estimates of the costs of climate change on agriculture than those obtained with short-term panel approaches (such as Deschênes and Greenstone, 2007). However, empirical results in the literature have to date indicated the opposite. This inconsistency between theoretical and empirical insights has constituted a puzzling issue for a long time. Several papers have already proposed intermediate “medium-term” approaches to overcome this issue (Burke and Emerick, 2016, Merel and Gammans, 2021), but with limited success so far. Here, we propose an alternative approach, by regressing farmland values on climate conditions and plot fixed effects. Importantly, we highlight the fact that our new method allows us to resolve the empirical–theoretical inconsistency discussed in the literature.

Linking these fragmented regional or sectoral programs could improve environmental and economic outcomes, but differing initial conditions pose a challenge to linking. We explore the use of an allowance exchange rate, which denominates the compliance value of an emissions allowance differently in each program. In a theoretical model, we find that linking with an exchange rate in the politically plausible range—between the benchmark regimes of ","The environmental consequences of greenhouse gas emissions are felt around the globe, regardless of where those emissions originate. Correspondingly, in the 1990s, numerous economists heralded a single international carbon market as the cost-effective solution to climate change. Such a market would, in principle, lead to a single global carbon price through the trade of emissions allowances, which would serve to identify and realize emissions reductions at the lowest possible cost and yield the cost-effective geographic distribution of abatement. Despite the logic of this approach, international policymakers were unable to implement this vision and climate governance has taken a different path.====Today 68 international, national, regional, state, provincial, and municipal carbon pricing or trading programs are in operation, instead of the single international carbon market that was once imagined (World Bank 2022). Across these programs, the prevailing carbon prices range from $0.00 to $137.30 USD per ton of carbon dioxide (CO====) equivalent,==== representing an immense variety of environmental ambitions and abatement costs. Additionally, in some jurisdictions, different sectors of the economy are covered by separate existing or proposed pricing or trading programs (Perino et al. 2020). For example, in Germany, power plants are covered by the European Union's trading program and face a price of $87 per ton, while emissions from the buildings and transportation sectors are covered by Germany's trading program and face a price of only $33 per ton.==== This fragmentation leaves important opportunities for improved cost-effectiveness on the table and coordination could enable greater environmental stringency at lower total costs.====A central way to improve the cost-effectiveness of this patchwork is to aggregate through bilateral or multilateral linking, a process in which the regulatory authorities in each program mutually allow their regulated firms to use emissions allowances from any of the linked programs to meet compliance obligations (Jaffe et al. 2009).==== The expected cost savings in linking carbon markets stem from differences in marginal abatement costs, but linking markets with different emissions reduction opportunities will create a revenue transfer that is viewed as politically challenging (Verde et al., 2020). Recent policy discussions regarding the linking of trading programs have considered an allowance exchange rate, which potentially denominates the compliance value of an emissions allowance (i.e., the quantity of emissions per allowance) differently in each program. An exchange rate provides policymakers with a mechanism to improve environmental and economic outcomes, to better balance the costs and benefits of linking programs, and to reconcile different program characteristics that otherwise might prohibit programs from linking. An exchange rate also provides policymakers with a way to link separate sectoral programs in the same jurisdiction without fully harmonizing the programs. We discuss these benefits in more detail below.====In this paper, we demonstrate that an allowance exchange rate can be used to improve both the environmental outcome of a linked system and the economic outcomes in each linked region or sector, as well as to harmonize trading programs with different initial program conditions including marginal costs, program stringency, and price collars. We develop an analytical model of a linked trading system to describe how an exchange rate affects overall efficiency and market outcomes, including distributional effects. We further explore these results by simulating the linking of two trading programs using a detailed model of regional electricity markets within the US that characterizes different specific design features in each program, accounting for how they interact with their respective regional electricity markets.====Carbon trading or pricing programs, as with many public policy choices, are the result of complex decision-making processes that include many competing stakeholder interests (Cohen et al., 1972, Kingdon, 1984), policy sequencing (Pahle et al., 2018), and political economy constraints (Rabe 2018). Once specific policy components—such as emissions cap levels or price containment mechanisms—are enshrined in law, they typically exhibit policy inertia, making them difficult for future policymakers to change, even during scheduled program reviews. Additionally, many authors argue for long-run program stability because administrative changes to carbon markets undermine investor confidence (Salant and Henderson 1978; Aldy et al., 2017; Burtraw et al., 2022). To reflect these realities of real-world climate policy, in our analytical model of linking, we take the designs of the existing trading programs as pre-determined and fixed for the time horizon considered.==== We then explore how linking at various allowance exchange rates alters market outcomes. In particular, we seek to determine what exchange rates, if any, yield both economic benefits in each region and environmental improvements globally, as well as what exchange rate is socially optimal.====Our analytical model yields novel and non-intuitive results about linking trading programs with an exchange rate. We first find that linking with an exchange rate between the benchmark regimes of autarky (no linking) and traditional 1:1 trading (linking without an exchange rate) yields greater abatement than the amount achieved at each of the bookends, and this additional abatement is achieved at strictly lower costs than autarky. We also show that exchange rate values in this range yield economic surplus gains in each region, as compared to autarky.==== This range of exchange rates is likely to be the only set of exchange rates that would be considered by policymakers because it represents an intermediate step toward full integration, moving from the status quo toward traditional 1:1 linking. Thus, linking programs with any plausible exchange rate can be expected to yield benefits for the environment and each regional economy that dominate the outcomes under autarky, and yield environmental benefits when compared to the conventional approach to linking.====We further find that traditional linking (i.e., one-for-one trading between programs) with fully fungible allowances, which achieves an efficient distribution of abatement through a uniform allowance price (Mehling et al. 2019), is rarely socially optimal. Trading programs typically fail to set emissions caps at optimal levels—as shown by the wide range of prices in existing programs—and linking with an exchange rate can alter the total amount of abatement, because one allowance no longer corresponds to one unit of emissions. As a result, it is socially optimal to use an allowance exchange rate that trades off the cost-effectiveness of equating marginal costs in favor of moving the linked system closer to the efficient level of total abatement. When trading program emissions caps achieve an inefficiently low level of emissions abatement, as has been generally observed to date, this socially optimal exchange rate lies within the same likely range described above. This result contributes to the literature showing the optimality of non-uniform carbon prices in many contexts.====Our analytical model also considers the use of an allowance exchange rate when linking programs with price collars, which is novel in the literature. When considering the linking of trading programs with price collars, a potential criticism is that one program's price collar might erode the environmental ambition of the other linked program (Vivid Economics 2020; Doda et al. 2022). We show that for a politically plausible range of allowance exchange rates, linked price collars are not expected to bind. Thus, even in the presence of price collars, environmental and economic benefits are expected when linking with an exchange rate.====Our simulation modeling explores the linking of two hypothetical trading programs that cover regions of the United States electricity sector. Using this more robust modeling framework, we confirm our analytical results about abatement, abatement costs, and the socially optimal allowance exchange rate. We find, however, that the efficiency gains may be distributed in ways not predicted by our simple analytical framework. Additionally, linking with an exchange rate can greatly affect the co-benefits of reducing other air pollutants. The consideration of co-benefits usually reinforces the climate benefits and efficiency gains of linking, but it may alter the choice of a specific allowance exchange rate.====A wealth of qualitative literature describes the potential advantages of linking in economic terms and the institutional arrangements that would be necessary under international agreements (Mehling et al. 2018). For example, in principle, bilateral or multilateral linking achieves a unified price per unit of CO==== emissions across the newly linked system that is expected to lower overall abatement costs. The potential gains from efficiently allocating abatement are greater the greater are differences in pre-linked allowance prices. Linking also can dampen allowance price volatility caused by regional variations in the demand or supply of allowances because typically the factors that influence emissions such as weather or economic activity are imperfectly correlated across jurisdictions (Flachsland et al. 2009; Burtraw et al., 2013; Doda et al. 2019). In some circumstances, linking can ameliorate concerns over competitiveness impacts by explicitly addressing the possibility for leakage of economic activity between jurisdictions that may result from differences in program stringency (Jaffe et al. 2009). Moreover, there are other potentially significant benefits to linking that are not economic in nature. From an environmental perspective, the reduction in abatement costs achieved by linking could make it easier to enhance ambition (Bodansky et al., 2016). From a political perspective, linking starts to dispel the free-rider narrative that can prevent individual jurisdictions from pricing carbon in the absence of an international carbon price (Flachsland et al. 2009).====There is also a significant qualitative literature that outlines the potential costs of linking. First and foremost, established links between trading programs have required significant negotiations between jurisdictions to harmonize the design of the programs; the time and resources spent on this process of harmonization can be thought of as a fixed cost of linking. In addition, the efficiency gains achieved by linking may come with associated costs. For example, linking requires ceding some control over domestic allowance prices, which might be regarded as a political cost (Ranson and Stavins 2016), or a virtue when it insulates policymakers from narrow interest groups within their jurisdiction (Burtraw et al., 2013). While linking may reduce overall abatement costs, it may have negative economic impacts on particular actors in each jurisdiction (Newell et al. 2013).==== Moreover, linking can exacerbate allowance price volatility in certain cases (Doda and Taschini 2017). From an environmental perspective, a broader market is likely to reduce leakage, but linking could increase emissions leakage if allowance prices increase in the program that is more susceptible to leakage (Jaffe et al. 2009) and may alter incentives for cap setting, encouraging programs to set higher emissions caps to achieve lower prices and therefore export more allowances, thereby resulting in higher emissions than would occur without linking (Bohm 1992; Helm 2003). Weitzman (2019) refers to the former issue as the primary free-rider problem and describes elements of program design including price floors and ceilings to affect distributional outcomes as a potential secondary free-rider problem. Strategic considerations may influence the decision about how to initially distribute emissions allowances, for example, through the use of output-based allocation to provide a production incentive to mitigate leakage that would likely increase the allowance price (Palmer et al., 2017). Linking also might provide an incentive to introduce companion policies, such as technology support policies, that reduce local demand for allowances, to increase allowance exports and associated government revenues.====Weighing the advantages and disadvantages of a specific link requires an accounting of the unique designs of each of the involved trading programs and how they would interact under a particular linking architecture. Quantitative approaches are useful in this regard. One vein of the quantitative literature on linking utilizes models to provide estimates of the efficiency gains achieved by linking (Springer 2003) or the emissions outcomes of different coalitions of linked trading systems (Paltsev 2001). A second vein of the quantitative literature on linking takes an analytical approach to investigate the impact of different linking architectures (e.g., a link between mass and rate-based trading programs or a restricted one-way link that discounts incoming allowances) (Fischer 2003; Schneider et al., 2017), or the impacts of unique program design features (e.g., market size) on the economic implications of linking (Doda and Taschini 2017).====Jurisdictions considering a potential link have some control over the domestic costs and benefits of the link by using an allowance exchange rate, which denominates the compliance value of an emissions allowance (i.e., the quantity of emissions per allowance) differently in each program. That is, an exchange rate mandates that an allowance from one program is worth more or less, in terms of compliance (allowable tons per allowance), than is an allowance from another program. While economists typically discuss exchange rates in the context of pollutants that impose local damages that vary by the source of emissions (Hung and Shaw 2005), the scholarly interest in applying exchange rates in the context of greenhouse gas emissions has increased in recent years (Fischer 2003; Metcalf and Weisbach 2012; Holland and Yates 2015; Böhringer and Fischer 2020). Greenhouse gas allowance exchange rates have also been included in recent policy discussions, including efforts by the World Bank's Networked Carbon Market Initiative==== (Marcu 2015; Macinante 2016) and China's stated intentions to discount allowances from regional emissions markets when its national trading program launches (Carbon Pulse, 2016).==== In addition, a discount rate—which is effectively an “asymmetric” exchange rate—is being negotiated under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement to achieve overall mitigation in global emissions (Schneider et al., 2018; Piris-Cabezas and Lubowski 2019). A fluctuating exchange rate may emerge implicitly in programs linking jurisdictions with different monetary currencies if at least one has a binding price collar, such as the California-Quebec link. Quemin and de Perthuis (2019) and Schneider et al. (2017) compare exchange rates with other mechanisms, such as quantitative limits on trading and border adjustments as transitional mechanisms, to guide heterogeneous programs towards cost-effective outcomes. Linking with an explicit exchange rate would involve accounting for the jurisdiction of origin in allowance exchanges and portfolios, which incidentally may offer an administrative remedy to some of the challenges of potential de-linking (Pizer and Yates 2015).====Where carbon pricing already exists in segments of the economy, many jurisdictions are considering new and separate programs in other sectors. One motivation for separate programs is that the price elasticity of emissions reductions is relatively low, for example in the transportation and building sectors, and a uniform carbon price linking to existing programs would impose a cost burden in those new sectors without yielding substantial investment or emissions reductions.==== Nonetheless, carbon pricing can accelerate diffusion of technology and provide revenue to fund infrastructure and other investments. Even within existing regional programs, the ambitions of individual jurisdictions often evolve differently over time. Many jurisdictions have mandated accelerated emissions reductions even while they are linked within a broader regional market, which could result in internal emissions leakage within the broader market, sometimes described as the waterbed effect (Perino 2018; Perino et al. 2020). By using an allowance exchange rate to link sectors or jurisdictions that have different ambition and abatement opportunities, policymakers can sustain the environmental ambition of each program and improve cost effectiveness while attenuating distributional concerns and financial flows among sectors or programs.====Both the qualitative and quantitative veins of the literature are useful in characterizing the theoretical benefits and costs of linking but tend to assume that trading programs are nearly identical in design. We extend the existing literature by evaluating the linking of regional and sectoral trading programs with various and different designs (i.e., different levels of program stringency and price collars) and considering how different design parameters interact with alternative architectures for linking (e.g., different exchange rates for allowances). We make two primary contributions with this work. First, we develop an analytical model that formalizes the economic implications and emissions market outcomes of regional or sectoral linking with an exchange rate. With this model, we are the first to analytically describe the linking of sectoral trading programs with an allowance exchange rate. The model yields novel findings on the results of linking emissions markets, as well as the formalization of results that had previously been described only qualitatively. Second, we test several of our analytical results and illustrate other important market outcomes of linking by simulating a link between regional trading programs. We use a simulation model of electricity markets within the US to characterize the specific design features of two hypothetical regional trading programs, accounting for how they interact with their respective regional electricity markets. We simulate the trading programs in autarky and under various exchange rates. The electricity market model allows us to illustrate a range of efficiency and distributional implications and emissions outcomes that can arise from linking without losing the detailed designs of the two emissions markets as well as the nuanced and important interactions that might occur between them when linked.",Linking carbon markets with different initial conditions,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069623000384,29 April 2023,2023,Research Article,7.0

To accomplish this requires rigorously estimating the demand for deforestation. We contribute to this endeavor by estimating the effect of crop prices on the demand for conversion of land from forest to agriculture in the tropics during the 21st century. The two main difficulties involved are the lack of harmonized data on local crop prices in the tropics and the fact that they are determined simultaneously with decisions to deforest. We propose a strategy to circumvent these two issues using high-resolution annual forest loss data for the tropics, combined with information on crop-specific agricultural suitability and annual international crop prices. We find that crop price variation has a significant impact on deforestation: increases in crop prices are estimated to be responsible for one-third of total deforestation in the tropics (totaling about 2 million km","Tropical deforestation is one of the main causes of global environmental degradation. Recent estimates indicate that food systems are responsible for a third of global anthropogenic GHG emissions (Crippa et al., 2021). It has been estimated that 17% of tropical moist forests have disappeared since 1990, and of the remaining one billion hectares (as of 2019), 10% are degraded (Vancutsem et al., 2021). Deforestation threatens crucial ecosystem services, such as biodiversity richness, climate regulation, carbon storage and water supplies, and encourages the spread of infectious diseases.==== Forests not only provide private goods such as timber and non-timber products and local public goods in the form of watersheds, erosion control, nutrient recycling and local climate effects, but also global public goods such as carbon storage and biodiversity (see, for example, Sandler, 1993). The main market failure involved arises from the nature of these global public goods and the presence of positive externalities, whereby the preservation efforts of one country also benefit other countries. Moreover, market forces appear to be among the most important factors driving the agricultural expansion (Angelsen, 1999, Pendrill et al., 2019b) that leads to tropical deforestation (Geist and Lambin, 2002, Curtis et al., 2018, Balboni et al., 2022). Forecasts predict a sharp increase in food demand in coming decades, with projected growth of at least 50% by 2050 (Fukase and Martin, 2020, FAO, 2017). This will clearly drive crop prices up and will also likely lead to a strong increase in the demand for land, and in the private value of agricultural land (Souza-Rodrigues, 2019).====We seek to estimate the effect of changes in crop prices on deforestation in the tropics. We combine various datasets for the tropical regions at the spatial resolution of 0.5-degree latitude and longitude grid cells (approximately 55 × 55 km at the equator) for the period 2001–2018. We first make use of fine-grained estimates of yearly deforestation at the level of 1 arc-second pixels (approximately 30 m ==== 30 m at the equator, Hansen et al., 2013). For each cell, we compute the total number of pixels that are deforested in each year. We then gather cell-specific information on the agronomic suitability of 15 crops in order to proxy the potential crop specialization at the cell level (Global Agro- Ecological Zones, GAEZ hereafter, Fischer et al., 2012). We combine these data with the international prices of crops traded on international markets in order to construct a cell-specific, time-varying crop price index. This index is computed as the weighted sum of international crop prices in a given year, weighted by the relative agronomic suitability of each crop in the cell.==== Our final sample includes around 12,000 cells of 0.5 × 0.5 degree for the period 2001–2018.====This strategy makes it possible to estimate the effect of local crop prices on local deforestation while taking into account the threat of simultaneity between the conversion of forest land to agriculture and local crop prices, in the absence of harmonized data on local crop prices. It exploits within-cell variation in the international crop price index and in deforestation over time. We control for a large array of unobserved factors, including all time-invariant cell characteristics, national time-varying shocks that might correlate with both deforestation and international crop prices, and local shocks such as weather fluctuations. We find that changes in crop prices significantly affect deforestation in the tropics and that the effect is sizeable: our baseline estimates imply that the increase in our price index during the sample period explains around one third of the total deforestation observed in the tropics during that period (i.e. approximately ==== million km====). The effect of crop price variation on deforestation increases significantly with initial forest cover, and also depends on cell-specific characteristics. The effect is more pronounced in cells more open to international trade (proxied by the distance to a seaport), in less wealthy cells (proxied by nighttime luminosity in 2000) and, to a lesser extent, in cells with weaker state capacity (proxied by the distance to the capital city). The results are robust to a variety of sensitivity tests, including the use of different estimators, standard errors adjustments, alternative definitions of the canopy threshold, inclusion of additional controls that may affect both deforestation and prices, and the exclusion of large traders that might be influencing world commodity prices. While we cannot totally rule out that the results may be partly driven by a direct effect, such that international prices directly affect the deforestation decisions of actors such as multinationals or local land managers, we nonetheless provide suggestive evidence that they are driven by an indirect effect, such that international prices affect deforestation by way of local prices. Using data on a sub-sample of countries and crops, we find that local crop prices indeed correlate substantially with international prices. We interpret the results to be demand-driven, based on a number of robustness checks which suggest that the supply conditions in large producers do not affect the estimates. This interpretation is further supported by the results which remain qualitatively similar when using a measure of foreign demand based on changes in foreign imports, rather than our international price index. Hence, our results suggest that changes in global demand and modifications of individual preferences may be having a strong impact on deforestation levels.====The paper contributes to the literature in various dimensions. First, it is the first attempt to estimate the effect of crop prices on deforestation at the local level on a global scale. While the idea that crop prices, driven by expanding global demand, are contributing to tropical deforestation is not new (Angelsen, 1999, Angelsen and Kaimowitz, 1999, Angelsen, 2010, Rudel et al., 2009, Busch and Ferretti-Gallon, 2017), the empirical evidence to date has a number of drawbacks (Pendrill et al., 2022).==== The usual approaches in the studies carried out on a global scale include spatial attribution, input–output models, and trade and land-balance models.==== These approaches typically use supply-side models at the national level and downscale national trade or production data to the local level. Second, by using worldwide information on agricultural suitability based on resource limitations (plant eco-physiological characteristics, climatic and edaphic requirements of crops), our approach is more tractable and is able to overcome the absence of fine-grained information on local prices in many countries.==== Third, our methodology is agnostic in terms of scale of agricultural production, in contrast to studies based on spatial attribution or classification methods, which attribute large-scale commodity-driven deforestation to shifting agriculture (Curtis et al., 2018, Austin et al., 2019).==== Fourth, it makes use of a sample of areas that were forested at the beginning of the sample period, rather than only deforested areas at the end, thus facilitating causal interpretation. Fifth, our empirical approach, which combines exogenous local crop suitability with global crop prices, allows us to control for a wide range of potential confounding factors not accounted for in previous studies. Finally, we highlight a number of policy-relevant local factors that affect the way in which fluctuations in crop prices trigger deforestation.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the potential mechanisms while Section 3 describes the data and the empirical strategy. Section 4 presents the results. Section 5 presents the sensitivity analysis and discusses at length the interpretation of the results.

We exploit two sudden policy changes in Milan's congestion pricing scheme resulting in a shift from priced to unpriced road use: a temporary suspension of the scheme in 2012, and a durable reduction in its application schedule. We find that the sudden removal of road pricing decreases bike-sharing use by about 5%. The policy impact mainly occurs through the increase of road traffic congestion, which makes cycling less safe and pleasant. The reduction in the schedule leads to an 8% decline in bike-sharing use in the affected time window. Our findings indicate that policies inducing drivers to internalise the external costs of car use also promote the uptake of non-polluting transport modes. This widens the spectrum of benefits that need to be considered in the design and implementation of road pricing policies.","Transport-related greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution are crucial environmental policy issues. The transport sector generates almost 25% of global CO==== emissions from fuel combustion, with road transport making up for over 70% of total transport CO==== emissions (IEA, 2019). Urban populations are particularly exposed to air pollution caused by road transport: about 97% of cities in low- and middle-income countries and 49% of cities in high-income countries do not meet WHO air quality guidelines (World Health Organisation, 2018). Outdoor air pollution has seen an increasing trend in urban environments: between 2008 and 2013, annual mean concentrations of PM==== globally increased by 8% (World Health Organization, 2016).====In OECD countries, the cost of the health impact of outdoor air pollution, including both deaths and illnesses, was about USD 1.7 trillion in 2010. Road transport has been estimated to account for over 50% of the cost of these health impacts (OECD, 2014; OECD, 2016). In addition to costs of air pollution from road transport, urban traffic congestion entails significant economic costs, including the cost of additional in-vehicle travel time and the cost of fuel wasted in congestion.====Because road transport causes an important part of emissions in urban areas and economic losses from congestion are significant, cities face the challenge of designing transport policies to address these problems. Urban road pricing is part of these policy efforts.==== The extent to which road pricing policies can effectively reduce congestion and emissions depends on the travel behaviour changes they induce: modal shifts away from car use and towards soft mobility options are key in this endeavour. Providing green mobility services, such as bike sharing, is a complementary way to facilitate the desired behavioural changes.====In this paper, we provide the first assessment of the causal impact of road pricing on the use of bike sharing, a sustainable urban transport mode which has become increasingly popular in the past decade. Our paper contributes to two main strands of the literature: first, the literature investigating the effects of road pricing on travel behaviour and the environment; and second, the literature on the interaction between bike sharing and traffic congestion, and how this is affected by the urban transport policy mix.====While a few papers have analysed the impact of urban road pricing on the use of motor vehicles and, to a lesser extent, on public transport (Eliasson et al., 2009; Gibson and Carnovale, 2015; Leape, 2006), the effects of pollution and congestion pricing on the adoption of non-motorised urban transport options remain largely unexplored.==== Likewise, while the previous literature has assessed the traffic congestion benefits associated with the introduction of bike sharing in urban transport systems (Hamilton and Wichman, 2018), no study has looked at the effect of policy-induced changes in traffic congestion on bike-sharing.====When exposed to urban road pricing, users might alter trip times or routes, shift to other means of transport, or completely forgo trips (Leape, 2006). Most empirical evidence on these effects has relied on the analysis of congestion pricing schemes implemented in London, Milan and Stockholm. For example, congestion pricing reduced motor vehicle use by up to 27% in Stockholm (Eliasson et al., 2009). Similarly, a suspension of congestion pricing led to a 14.5% traffic increase in Milan (Gibson and Carnovale, 2015), and to the use of more polluting vehicles in the city centre (Percoco, 2014).====Time substitution of trips has been observed both in Milan and in Stockholm, as motor vehicle users shift their departure times to avoid paying a fee, leading to peak-spreading (Gibson and Carnovale, 2015; Karlström and Franklin, 2009). Congestion pricing has induced spatial substitution in both London and Milan: drivers circumvent the area to avoid paying a fee, thus leading to increased traffic in the areas neighbouring the congestion zone (Leape, 2006; Gibson and Carnovale, 2015).====While pointing to modal shift from car use to public transport and bike use, analyses of the impact of road pricing on these means of transportation have solely been based on before/after comparisons of aggregate statistics rather than on causal inference building upon microdata (Leape, 2006; Eliasson et al., 2009). Thanks to a detailed dataset containing microdata on over 12 million user-identified bike-sharing trips, this paper estimates the causal effect of congestion pricing on bike-sharing use. To this end, we exploit a natural experiment setting in Milan,==== where congestion pricing has been in place since early 2012.====Our empirical strategy is based on two policy changes: a sudden and temporary suspension of Milan's congestion charge in summer 2012, and a durable reduction in the application schedule of the charge on Thursday evenings in autumn 2012. Both policy changes translate into a shift from priced to unpriced road use, either throughout the entire day or at a specific time of the day, effectively generating two natural experiments. Comparing bike-sharing use between time windows treated and untreated with congestion pricing enables the assessment of the policy impact.====Car entries to the congestion charge zone are expected to increase at times when access to the centre becomes unpriced. Bike-sharing use might decrease for two main reasons. First, cyclists turn to cars or other motorised modes due to the reduction in the relative price of car use vis-à-vis bike-sharing. We denote this channel with the term ====. The price effect might also have an indirect impact on bike-sharing use: if public transport users turn to driving, less crowded public transport might attract former cyclists, reducing the demand for bike-sharing use. Second, increased street congestion within the cordon toll zone might make cycling less safe or less pleasant. Thus, bike-sharing use might also decrease because of the increased traffic congestion in the streets,==== a channel denoted with the term ====.====We discuss in detail the drivers of the price and congestion effects, and investigate the relative importance of price signals and urban traffic congestion in inducing changes in bike-sharing use. To this end, we exploit the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of bike-sharing use. More specifically, we characterise bike-sharing trips according to their time, their origin and destination, and the position of these with respect to the boundaries of the congestion pricing zone.====We find that suspending congestion pricing reduces daily bike-sharing use by around 5% in the short run. On the other hand, the durable reduction of the schedule of the congestion charge reduces bike-sharing use in the affected time window, Thursday early evening, by around 8%.====We also analyse the extent to which these impacts vary along two dimensions of the urban environment: the direction of bike-sharing traffic relative to the congestion charge zone and the proximity of bike-sharing stations to metro stations. Furthermore, we discuss how the effects of congestion pricing vary with the timing of bike-sharing trips, and with the individual habits and preferences of bike-sharing users.====Our findings indicate that policies directly aimed at internalising the external costs of car use, can have an indirect but noticeable impact on alternative transport options. As a consequence, such policies can support behaviour change along with other policy interventions aimed at directly incentivising cycling, such as the development of bike lanes.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows.

The cost of a bicycle trip increases from $0 to $1 after 30 min. We observe cyclists adding time to their trip by checking-in at an intermediate station along their route to avoid the price, thus revealing their value of saving time (VST) cycling. Estimates of the VST for cycling are close to the minimum wage or roughly 20% of hourly wages implied by median incomes. These estimates are smaller than comparable estimates for automobiles, likely driven by leisure benefits of cycling. Although bicycle commuters exhibit somewhat larger VSTs, our results across user type, time, and route-specific characteristics are relatively homogeneous, suggesting a more fundamental time–money tradeoff. Additionally, we estimate small changes along extensive margins in response to a large price increase, but changes along intensive margins are virtually nonexistent.","Time is a fundamental economic constraint. Becker (1965) operationalized time-allocation decisions as a function of forgone earnings: in essence, the opportunity cost of time is equal to the shadow value on money income. DeSerpa (1971) generalized this model to allow different activities to possess different values of time, providing a consistent framework to evaluate how individuals trade off money for time spent in a specific activity.====The value of time – or, more concretely, the value of saving time (VST) – is a critical input into both transportation policy and nonmarket valuation methods that rely on travel costs. One of the largest automobile externalities is the external cost of traffic congestion (Parry et al., 2007), thus reducing time spent in traffic is often the largest economic benefit of improvements in transportation infrastructure. On the other hand, time spent traveling to recreational sites is typically the largest cost associated with a recreational trip (Phaneuf and Smith, 2005), which can then be used to value environmental quality changes. For example, the opportunity cost of time was a primary feature of the value of lost recreational benefits from the Deep Water Horizon oil spill (Deepwater Horizon Natural Resource Damage Assessment Trustees, 2016). Although the theory of time allocation decisions is well-established, there remain unsettled empirical questions about the value of time for specific purposes (utilitarian vs. recreational),==== for different modes of transit, and for differences arising from methodological approaches (e.g., stated vs. revealed preference).====In this paper, we estimate revealed values of saving time for cyclists on an intensive margin in contrast to much of the literature that relies a combination of stated and revealed preference data using discrete-choice frameworks. Much of this literature focuses on time–money tradeoffs identified through motorists’ preferences for free travel on congested routes vs. priced, free-flowing travel on toll roads or express lanes either using stated preference surveys that present hypothetical scenarios, revealed decisions based on observed route choice, or a combination of both (Small et al., 2005, Fezzi et al., 2014, Lew and Larson, 2005, Bockstael et al., 1987, Feather and Shaw, 1999).==== In contrast, we leverage observed cyclist behavior in response to a “notched”, nonlinear pricing structure that introduces a discontinuity in the cost of a trip beyond 30 min. This setting is unique in that the discontinuous price threshold provides a direct price for time spent commuting and recreating via bicycle. In response to this nonlinear incentive, we identify cyclists who re-dock their bicycle midway through their trip to reset their trip’s duration, thus avoiding the price but adding a time cost to their trip—a phenomenon colloquially referred to as “daisychaining”. By comparing the duration of daisychained trips to counterfactual direct trips on similar routes, we estimate a time-for-money trade off in a way that is consistent with DeSerpa (1971), which provides a framework to estimate activity-specific values of time and allows individuals to gain utility directly from time spent in a given activity. These features are important because cyclists likely use bikesharing programs for utilitarian and recreational purposes. We explore this heterogeneity directly via cyclist type, temporal heterogeneity, and observable route characteristics that are suggestive of a given trip’s purpose.====We uncover several key results. First, we estimate that cyclists spend 7–9 min daisychaining to avoid a discontinuous price increase of $1 in our preferred specifications. These estimated time expenditures are robust to controlling for unobserved heterogeneity at the route and cyclist level, and they are estimated on a matched sample that accounts for the nonrepresentativeness of daisychained trips. Second, there is intuitive heterogeneity in this response based on observable characteristics: routes, users, and time periods associated with leisurely trips generally exhibit greater time expenditures, while routes, users, and time periods that are associated with utilitarian trips exhibit smaller time expenditures daisychaining. Although this heterogeneity aligns with predictions from our conceptual framework and general intuition, the gap in time expenditures for leisure vs. commuting trips is relatively narrow.====Using these estimated time expenditures, we measure cyclists’ revealed value of saving time at approximately $6–9 per hour. This estimate is approximately 13%–25% of local wage rates, depending on different measures of income. This value of time saved is small relative to official US Department of Transportation (DOT) guidance (U.S. Department of Transportation, 2014), which suggests valuing time saved cycling at 100% of the wage rate. The measure used in DOT guidance, however, presumes that time spent on a bicycle provides discomfort and should be valued similarly to time spent waiting outside for (or standing inside of) a bus. These values are intended to capture the disutility of commuting. In this paper, we argue that cycling provides enjoyment benefits, resulting in a lower VST than alternative modes of transit. Our estimates are also small relative to recent revealed preference estimates from the transportation literature. Wolff (2014) finds that drivers’ speed choice in response to fuel costs reveal an estimate around 50% of the prevailing wage; Fezzi et al. (2014) find estimates closer to 75% of the wage rate for drivers choosing to use toll roads en route to the beach; and Goldszmidt et al. (2020) find estimates equal to 100% the median wage from a large-scale experiment with a ridesharing company that experimentally varies wait times for consumers. Our estimates are considerably smaller than most in this literature, which can be explained by the fact that cyclists bicycle because it provides greater utility than driving. Time spent commuting on a bicycle is valued more strongly than time spent commuting in a vehicle, which, sensibly, translates to lower values of ==== time for cyclists. Further, many cyclists use bikesharing programs as leisure or as an input to a leisurely activity (Chan and Wichman, 2020).==== Although perhaps counterintuitive, the smaller values of saving time on a bicycle that we estimate are supportive of policies that increase commuting and recreational cycling opportunities because they are inclusive of the enjoyment cyclists receive when cycling. Specifically, because the VST for cycling is a fraction of estimated VSTs for other modes of transit, this suggests that cyclists would be willing to spend comparatively more time cycling than driving a car, waiting for an Uber, or standing on a bus for a similar trip purpose.====Our primary time-expenditure estimates for cyclists vary by whether a bikeshare user is a “registered” or “casual” user, by day-of-week and hour-of-day, and by route characteristics (such as proximity to parks, bicycle lanes, transit stops, and commercial building density). The strongest aspect of heterogeneity we find is that registered users on weekday mornings add the least amount of time to their trips to avoid the price increase, which translates to a larger value of time saved. This behavior accords with findings from Bento et al. (2020) who focus on the value of urgency, driven by scheduling constraints, and Buchholz et al. (2020) who find that values of time revealed through a ride-hailing service are slightly larger during work hours. Even for these cyclists who are likely commuting to work, their estimated VST is roughly 1/3 the wage rate. What is more surprising in these results is the degree of homogeneity in VSTs across user type and trip purpose. Across the spectrum of implied utilitarian and recreational trips, our estimated value of time is approximately equal to the minimum wage and around 20% of the prevailing hourly wage inferred from median incomes.====Additionally, we exploit a 400% increase in the price of a trip beyond 30 min, from $1 to $5, to explore price responsiveness of cyclists along extensive and intensive margins. We estimate a modest increase in the proportion of trips daisychained (extensive margin), which is concentrated among casual users, weekend trips, and routes with more park area and lower transaction costs for daisychaining. Along an intensive margin, however, we estimate no change in the duration of daisychained trips or the speed of daisychained trips (relative to direct trips) in response to the price increase. We find additional suggestive evidence that cyclists with more familiarity of the bikeshare system (regular users on weekdays) might ride slightly faster on direct trips to avoid the price increase. The lack of price responsiveness on the intensive margin is likely driven by the fact that many intermediate stations exist along routes, so cyclists need not expend more than 7–9 min to avoid the price, regardless of its level. Alternative behavioral explanations for this price inelasticity include reference dependence focused on the free segment of the trip or responsiveness to quantity thresholds and not price levels.====Overall, this paper make several contributions. We provide the first revealed preference estimate of how cyclists trade off time for money, which is an important input to transportation policy decisions, especially as those policies aim to reduce automobile externalities by shifting drivers to active modes of transit. Second, we contribute to the broader revealed preference literature on valuing time for both commuting and leisure purposes by exploiting a nonlinear pricing structure that affects both types of bikeshare usage. By leveraging user, time, and route characteristics, we shed light on how time–money tradeoffs are affected by the purpose of the trip within the same sample for a novel mode of transit. Lastly, we document extensive margin changes in response to a large price change, but find virtually no responsiveness along intensive margins.====In what follows, we provide background on bikesharing, in general, and on the cyclists’ behavior that we leverage to reveal time-for-money tradeoffs, in particular. We then situate this behavior in a conceptual framework that motivates our empirical approach.

Linking or otherwise expanding the scope of an emissions trading system (ETS) across multiple jurisdictions can exploit efficiency gains from increased flexibility as to where to emit or abate. The most prominent example of cross-country emissions trading is the EU ETS, which started in 2005 and covers greenhouse gas emissions from energy-intensive installations (as well as airlines) across 27 EU member states, the UK, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland. In North America, cross-jurisdiction emissions trading occurs between the 11 northeastern states participating in the U.S. Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a cooperative effort to cap and reduce CO==== emissions from the power sector, and also in the linked cap-and-trade systems of California and Québec.====While multilateral emissions trading is appealing on overall cost-effectiveness grounds, linking across countries involves ceding regulatory control, and the result may not (sufficiently) reflect the heterogeneous preferences of countries regarding the prevailing emissions allowance price (Flachsland et al., 2009). In the EU ETS, emissions allowance prices between 2008 and 2018 were stuck at very low levels, between €5 and €10 per ton of carbon dioxide (CO====).==== Against this background, several states covered by the EU ETS began exploring unilateral options for setting minimum CO==== prices nationally. The UK led by requiring power sector facilities to pay a carbon price support on top of the ETS allowance price to ensure that a specific domestic minimum carbon price is achieved (Hirst 2018). France was openly advancing a price floor for the power sector in 2016 (Szabo 2016). The desire to increase domestic CO==== prices through unilateral action, even though a jurisdiction already participates in multilateral emissions trading, is not confined to the European Union. For example, New York State's Independent System Operator has proposed a carbon pricing adder to electricity dispatch prices, despite its participation in the RGGI (Akin-Olçum et al., 2021).====In the EU case, to support allowance prices, the European Commission postponed the auctioning of 900 million allowances from the years 2014–2016 until 2019–2020 (so-called back-loading) and introduced what is now called the market stability reserve (MSR) from 2019 onwards (EU 2018), which (after coupled with invalidation provisions) pushed allowance prices upwards. The subsequent price increases still did not alleviate concerns about the durability of the effect of these measures in the mid-run (Rosendahl 2019; Flachsland et al., 2020) and the sufficiency of the ETS allowance prices for sustaining the decarbonization path towards climate neutrality by 2050 (Edenhofer et al., 2017; Ricke et al., 2018).==== Unilateral efforts continued, as the Netherlands drafted a law for a minimum CO==== price in the electricity sector, similar to that in the UK, and included in its 2021 budget a legislative proposal for a carbon price floor on industrial installations as well.==== In 2022, Denmark adopted a corporate carbon tax which effectively works as a national carbon price floor for Danish companies covered by the EU ETS.====An extensive economic literature discusses the role for CO==== price floors in emissions trading systems, primarily as an instrument to hedge against uncertainty. Under uncertainty over the costs and benefits of emissions abatement, a hybrid strategy that combines elements of quantity and price regulation can be superior to either approach taken alone for regulating carbon emissions (see, e.g., Weitzman 1974; Roberts and Spence 1976; Newell and Pizer 2003; Hepburn 2009). Myopic behavior by risk averse agents may also call for a price floor to align CO==== prices more closely with dynamically cost-effective price levels (Fuss et al., 2018; Kollenberg and Taschini 2019). In a similar vein, sharp price fluctuations can hamper the long-term efficiency of investment decisions as well as R&D activities in emissions abatement and justify measures such as a price floor to reduce excessive price volatility (Jotzo and Wood 2011).==== The potential for large price swings in CO==== trading systems is well framed by Borenstein et al. (2019), who document that the range of uncertainty over energy demand and thus baseline emissions often exceeds the range of abatement opportunities that can occur within a politically acceptable price range, meaning that allowances in an ETS are more likely to trade at administratively set floors or ceilings than inside a price collar.====These studies have all focused on ==== CO==== price floors, whereas today we see emerging cases of jurisdictions sufficiently unhappy or impatient with systemwide price supports that they want to intervene on their own. Strategic unilateral climate policies have received attention in the literature on using trade measures to protect against carbon leakage and support coalition building (e.g., Nordhaus 2015; Böhringer et al., 2016). However, divergent unilateral carbon pricing strategies ==== a coalition have received scant attention.====Our paper contributes to the literature by focusing on the different kinds of economic incentives and implications of ==== price floors implemented in a ==== emissions trading system. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to provide a cross-comparison of unilateral price floor options, using theoretical analysis along with quantitative simulations based on empirical data. As a first approach, for deriving the primary effects with maximum transparency, we analyze options in the canonical case of a cap-and-trade system with a fixed target in a static setting.====We investigate three options for setting minimum prices unilaterally—referred to as ====, ====, and ====—and their consequences for national and ETS systemwide allowance prices, revenues from emissions allowances, emissions, and economic welfare. First, the most commonly discussed approach to implement a national minimum price is to impose a supplemental tax on emissions equal to the difference between the prevailing ETS price and the minimum price (====). Although effective at raising revenues, this policy is ineffective at reducing systemwide emissions, which are fixed under the cap (the so-called “waterbed effect”), instead pushing down systemwide allowance prices; the resulting price disparities across jurisdictions cause systemwide economic efficiency losses. Second, a national auction reserve price would raise systemwide prices by withholding allowances (====). This strategy lowers systemwide emissions while maintaining price equalization across jurisdictions; however, only a narrow range of price increases can offset the revenue costs of lost sales for those with a unilateral price floor. The third option would require domestically covered entities to retire additional allowances for their emissions compliance, so that the effective cost per unit of emissions equals the targeted minimum price (====). This policy has the effect of increasing demand for allowances and thus pushing up the ETS price while reducing systemwide emissions; the price increase is enjoyed by all allowance holders, so revenues increase in proportion to the member states’ auctioned allowance holdings; firms in participating jurisdictions face higher marginal abatement costs, leading to a systemwide efficiency loss.====We consider three incentives for unilateral action that differ from the typical arguments of managing uncertainty in systemwide price floor discussions.====First, additional (or displaced) emissions reductions can bring environmental benefits when the prevailing ETS price does not fully internalize the social cost of carbon or of other externalities such as ancillary local pollutants. Whereas a higher social cost of carbon would demand more systemwide abatement, the latter rationale creates benefits from additional domestic reductions, shifting emissions away from home.====Second, unilateral action may bring additional revenues that offer fiscal benefits domestically: for example, they can be used to lower other, more distortionary taxes (Goulder 1995; Bovenberg 1999) or to pay for innovation and investment in low-carbon technologies. Such earmarking can be useful both for addressing technology market failures and to improve the political acceptability of carbon pricing (Kallbekken et al., 2011; Baranzini and Carattini 2017; Le Den et al., 2017; Santikarn et al., 2019).====Third, changes in the ETS price influence the terms of (allowance) trade. A member state may gain or lose from manipulating the systemwide price of emissions allowances, depending on whether it is a significant net importer or exporter of emissions allowances.====In our theoretical analysis, we derive optimal unilateral price floors that maximize the welfare gains of the unilaterally acting region as compared to a reference ETS situation without a price floor. We show that for a given domestic minimum price, ==== raises the most revenues for the unilaterally acting jurisdiction and results in the lowest systemwide allowance prices—and the largest price differential—but no net reduction in emissions. ==== lowers emissions the most and maintains cost-effectiveness but requires the greatest financial sacrifice by the acting jurisdiction. ==== represents a compromise between effecting real emissions reductions and retaining revenues, albeit with an efficiency loss due to higher domestic marginal abatement costs.====We complement the theoretical analysis with numerical simulations based on empirical EU ETS data to gain quantitative insights into optimal unilateral price floor strategies. Estimates of the marginal cost of public funds for member states indicate that the fiscal benefits of raising revenues from emissions taxes can be considerable, in which case ====—the most common form to date—can be a preferred policy, even with a waterbed effect. On the other hand, if the social cost of carbon is high enough relative to the reference ETS price, ==== or ==== are preferable.====A notable insight of our quantitative analysis is that, for identical emissions reductions, the efficiency loss of ==== relative to ==== is very modest, while the trade costs of ==== can become substantial. As a consequence, ==== can be preferable for achieving environmental benefits, and even more so if additional weight is placed on public revenues. Ultimately, a national government's preferred policy will depend on the extent to which the jurisdiction values revenues, which suggests ==== or to a lesser degree ====, versus the scope of emissions reductions, which favors ==== and also ====, particularly for jurisdictions with more emissions to leverage for overcompliance in order to absorb more allowances from the multilateral emissions cap.====In practice, most emissions trading systems deviate from the canonical scheme with program-specific market-management provisions and intertemporal linkages. As a prime example, the EU ETS MSR has rules for holding back, invalidating, or re-inserting allowances into circulation based on the number of banked allowances, in effect puncturing the waterbed effect and leading interventions to have different impacts depending on their timing through the process of allowance bank management (Perino et al., 2020; Gerlagh et al., 2021). RGGI meanwhile features both a cost-containment reserve and an emissions reduction reserve triggered by price thresholds. Such an upward sloping allowance supply will tend to compress the differences between the options but not influence their ranking. On the other hand, the MSR introduces some peculiarities that imply downward-sloping allowance supply for future changes (Perino et al., 2020), highlighting the need for EU-specific analysis to consider the overall context and timing of unilateral action. We discuss this and other potential extensions in concluding remarks.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a theoretical analysis of the economic effects of the three unilateral policy options to achieve domestic minimum prices. Section 3 presents our complementary numerical analysis on optimal price floor strategies.

A one ====g/m==== increase in PM 2.5 increases the same-day death rate by just over 4% from the mean. These effects tend to increase in magnitude over longer time horizons and are robust to a host of sensitivity tests. When analyzing potential mechanisms, we also demonstrate that an additional unit of PM 2.5 increases COVID-19-related hospitalizations by 0.8% and use of intensive care units by 0.5% on the same day. Using individual case records, we also show that higher PM 2.5 exposure at the time of case confirmation increases risk of later mechanical ventilation and mortality. These results suggest that air pollution plays an important role in mediating the severity of respiratory syndromes such as COVID-19.","The 2019 novel Coronavirus has claimed millions of lives globally. The total number of confirmed Coronavirus cases is in the order of hundreds of millions. The global economy suffered substantially as well. Policymakers around the world faced difficult trade-offs between public health and economic performance, especially in the early phase of the pandemic, as many policies to curb the spread of the disease entailed important consequences for the economy. We consider one element of this trade-off: contemporaneous air pollution exposure, with a specific focus on fine particulate matter. Fine particulate matter, or PM 2.5, refers to airborne particles with diameter of 2.5 ====m or less. When inhaled, these particles can travel deep into the respiratory system and have been linked to a wide range of adverse health outcomes (====). While PM 2.5 was associated with COVID-19 outcomes very early in the pandemic’s development (see ====), to the best of our knowledge very little action has been taken to address contemporaneous air pollution exposure in possibly helping to alleviate severe COVID-19 illnesses, with the exception perhaps of stringent traffic restrictions in China during the early phases of the pandemic, as described further in ==== for a discussion).====Hence, this paper aims to contribute to our understanding of the contemporaneous effects of air pollution on respiratory illnesses, with the goal of informing policy in response to respiratory-related pandemics. To this end, we use plausibly random daily changes in wind direction over the period from January 22 to August 15, 2020, to predict local fine particulate matter concentrations, providing quasi-experimental evidence of the effect of PM 2.5 exposure on COVID-19 outcomes. We leverage an established identification strategy that pre-dates the COVID-19 pandemic (====, ====, ====). In our preferred high dimensional fixed effects specification with weather, local policy, and social distancing controls from Unacast cell phone data, we show that a one ==== increase in PM 2.5 increases the same-day number of confirmed cases by 1.8% from the mean case incidence in a county, where confirmed cases are likely to be a measure for severe cases given that many individuals infected with COVID-19 do not show symptoms (====, ====, ====). In the three-day period following a perturbation in air quality, the relationship between fine particulate matter exposure and cases is over twice as large, at 0.35 additional cases per 100,000 individuals. Meanwhile, a one ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====; see also ==== for a general review of the literature). Our findings are also consistent with the recent COVID-19-specific medical literature suggesting a role for air pollution in modulating COVID-19 illness severity. In particular, local air pollution, and especially PM 2.5, may contribute to the severity of an infectious disease such as COVID-19 by debilitating the cardiovascular and immune systems (====, ====, ====).====Our paper contributes to several strands of literature. To start, it complements research by two concurrent papers that also apply causal inference techniques to add to our understanding of the relationship between local air pollution and COVID-19 outcomes. Our paper, ====, and ==== all conclude that contemporaneous exposure to local air pollution worsens COVID-19 outcomes. Our studies, however, have some distinct features. Our study’s application of the same identification strategy as ==== to a wider range of COVID-19 outcomes is unique, including not just cases and deaths but also hospitalizations, intensive care unit use, ventilator use, viral tests, and positivity rates. For these analyses, we leverage both daily state-level records as well as restricted individual-level case surveillance information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). We assess these COVID-19 outcomes in the context of the United States, the largest economy in the world and the nation with the most recorded COVID-19 cases and deaths over our sample period and overall. ==== also study the context of the United States, but focus on increased pollution from industrial facilities reporting to the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI). TRI facilities emit a variety of harmful pollutants into air and other environmental media, including no less than 770 toxic substances that cause cancer or acute human health effects (see ==== for a full list of TRI chemicals). Further, populations near TRI facilities may be more vulnerable to the effects of pollution than other communities, in part due to past exposure to TRI emissions. Hence, despite the rather widespread presence of TRI facilities in the United States, estimates in ==== apply to different pollutants and underlying populations than our nationwide study. As such, ==== tend to find a stronger relationship between pollution and COVID-19 outcomes than we do. In contrast, ==== apply an empirical approach that resembles ours, using plausibly exogenous changes in wind as an instrument for PM 10 as the main pollutant of interest. However, their focus is on Germany, a highly developed country like the United States, but one with possibly different institutional factors, public health policy during the COVID-19 pandemic, cultural preferences for compliance with regulation, and demand for environmental protection. In particular, case incidence per 100,000 individuals in Germany was less than one quarter the figure for the United States over our respective sample periods (1.7 compared to 7.9), and death incidence was similarly close to one half the US figure (0.09 to 0.2). Yet, we note with interest that our estimates are very well aligned with those in ====, potentially speaking to the external validity of our two studies.====These three studies, together, set the basis for what we hope may be an emerging literature applying causal inference techniques to examine the relationship between air pollution and COVID-19 outcomes and, along with ==== and ====, outcomes from viral infections at large. This strand of literature complements the epidemiological literature, generally correlational in nature, which is led by ====. With respect to ==== and the other epidemiological studies (such as ====, ====, ====), our approach is different in at least three dimensions. First, we use plausible exogenous variation to address potential endogeneity issues. Second, we focus on current exposure to particulate matter. The contemporaneous dimension is crucial during a pandemic because policymakers have the ability to influence contemporaneous pollution levels and individual avoidance behavior, but have no control over past exposure to air pollution. Third, we explore the underlying mechanisms linking pollution exposure to COVID-19 outcomes, such as analyses of hospitalizations, intensive care unit use, and mechanical ventilation.====Further, our study contributes to a growing literature showing detrimental effects of air pollution on a wide range of outcomes. For empirical reasons, such literature initially considered mostly early-life outcomes such as infant mortality (e.g., ====, ====, ====, ====) and birth weight (e.g., ====), but it has expanded substantially over the last decade to adult outcomes such as emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and adult mortality (e.g. ====, ====, ====, ====), dementia (e.g., ====), contemporaneous and long-run education outcomes (e.g., ====, ====), and other measures of productivity (e.g., ====). Our study is especially relevant to this body of work regarding adult mortality, adding additional evidence that COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, use of intensive care units, and mortality respond to local air pollution. Further, it adds to the growing body of work illustrating the short-term effect of pollution on health outcomes, including the relationship between days of exposure to pollution and mortality (e.g., ====, ====, ====, ====). Overall, we contribute to the literature on pollution and health by showing that air pollution, and in particular PM 2.5, plays an important role in the management of deadly infectious diseases such as COVID-19, and that these effects emerge very rapidly.====Finally, our study contributes to an emerging literature on the economics of the COVID-19 pandemic, aimed at identifying the best policy responses to this emergency (see ==== for a review). As such, our findings have important policy implications, which the paper discusses in detail. Such policy implications apply both to pandemic and non-pandemic times. From the contemporaneous relationship between PM 2.5 and COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, it follows that keeping pollution at low levels may have an immediate payoff in reducing severe cases and deaths during a pandemic. Policymakers have a wide range of short- and long-term policy levers available to reach this goal, as discussed in Section ====.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

Medical evidence has shown that a mother’s exposure to common chemical pollutants in drinking water that can pass through the placenta, such as arsenic, cadmium, and lead, is associated with the underdevelopment of the fetus (Rahman et al., 2009, Kippler et al., 2012, Renzetti et al., 2017). Moreover, disease-causing microorganisms in drinking water are linked to the transmission of diarrhea, a leading cause of death and malnutrition globally in children under five.====A vast literature has examined the causal link between early-life exposure to safe drinking water and child health, but with a focus on the short-term effect. Early-life exposure to unsafe drinking water results in poor birth outcomes and infant health (Currie et al., 2013, Rocha and Soares, 2015, Hill and Ma, 2022), while improvement in drinking water quality effectively reduces infant and child mortality (Galiani et al., 2005, Gamper-Rabindran et al., 2010, Alsan and Goldin, 2019, Bhalotra et al., 2021). Meanwhile, early-life exposure to safe drinking water is found to increase long-term educational and cognitive outcomes (Zhang and Xu, 2016, Chen et al., 2022). However, there are relatively few studies on the long-term effect of early-life exposure to safe drinking water on childhood health. Quantifying the long-term effect on childhood health is important for at least three reasons. First, it enriches knowledge about the first-order effect of safe drinking water on health outcomes. Second, it helps us understand to what extent improving childhood health underlies the effects of early-life conditions on non-health outcomes in later life. Third, it sheds light on the actual return of investments in improving access to safe drinking water.====We study the relatively long-term effect of early-life exposure to safe drinking water on childhood health in the context of rural China. A unique feature of this setting is that drinking boiled water is a common practice (Zhang et al., 2009). As boiling can inactivate most microorganisms in water (WHO, 2015), it protects Chinese children from being infected by disease-causing microorganisms in drinking water. Boiling, however, cannot remove the chemical pollutants from water, but water purification equipment can. We exploit the gradual rollout of a rural drinking water program in China that built water plants with water purification equipment and laid pipelines to supply treated tap water directly to rural households. Treated tap water has a lower concentration of active microorganisms and chemical pollutants than other sources of untreated water (Zhang et al., 2009). Given that the practice of drinking boiled water could inactivate most microorganisms even without access to treated tap water, our study provides suggestive evidence on whether the effect of treated tap water is attributable to the low concentration of chemical pollutants, as opposed to disease-causing microorganisms which are the main impurities in drinking water studied in previous research (e.g., Jalan and Ravallion, 2003, on India and Bhalotra et al., 2021, on Mexico).====We utilize rich data at the village level and individual level from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS). We start with an event study analysis to identify the dynamic effect of exposure to tap water. There is a growing consensus that environmental factors ==== and during the early years of life can have a persistent impact on health in later life (Almond et al., 2018). However, the critical window of exposure to safe drinking water for children’s health is not yet clear. Combining the timing of the first tap water connection in villages and the birth dates of a sample of children from the CFPS data, we are able to determine a child’s access to safe drinking water over time. We show that the beneficial impact of tap water on height-for-age, a marker of childhood health, comes from the ==== period and that there is a limited additional impact from postnatal exposure. We then use a difference-in-differences (DID) strategy, exploiting the variation in the timing of the first tap water connection across villages and comparing the children conceived before and after the connection within villages, to isolate the effect of ==== exposure to tap water on childhood health.====We find a sizable positive effect of ==== exposure to treated tap water on childhood height. Children with ==== exposure to tap water are 0.3 standard deviations taller at the ages of 1–11 than those of the same age and gender without the exposure. The estimate is very stable when we additionally control for province-specific cohort fixed effects, specific cohort effects for villages with similar characteristics, ==== exposure to health programs, and ==== exposure to other infrastructures (including electricity, roads, cable television, and landline phones). Moreover, the effect persists as the children grow up. For the same sample of children, the effect on height diminishes by one-third at the ages of 5–15, to 0.2 standard deviations, but is still of statistical and economic significance.====We also detect positive effects of ==== exposure to tap water on other health outcomes measured at birth and during childhood, such as the incidence of sickness and doctor visits. Examining children’s most severe diseases since birth by cause, we find that ==== exposure to tap water significantly reduces the incidence of non-waterborne digestive diseases, whereas the incidence of other disease types, including waterborne diseases, is not affected. These findings are consistent with the existing evidence that an improvement in water quality significantly reduces morbidity and mortality related to the digestive system (Ebenstein, 2012, Alsan and Goldin, 2019). They also lend support to our argument that the effect of ==== exposure to treated tap water on health is most likely driven by the low concentration of chemical pollutants rather than disease-causing microorganisms.====We further explore the mechanisms mediating the effect of ==== tap water exposure on childhood health. We probe two channels implied by the model of life-cycle human capital formation in Cunha and Heckman (2007) and Heckman (2007): (1) the direct channel, operating through the immediate effect of ==== exposure on health before age one; and (2) the behavioral channel, emphasizing parental investments in response to the exposure. We test both channels by exploring the heterogeneity by maternal education. We find that when the village has no tap water connection, low-educated mothers are less likely than high-educated mothers to use safe water for cooking, and having a tap water connection in the village reduces the difference.==== Consequently, the positive effect of ==== exposure to publicly provided tap water on height is greater for children of low-educated mothers than that for children of high-educated mothers. We then show that only for children of low-educated mothers does ==== tap water exposure improve health outcomes at birth and in infancy and induce postnatal health investments by parents. Therefore, our findings support both channels and are consistent with the argument that behavioral responses magnify the baseline effects of early-life conditions (Adhvaryu and Nyshadham, 2016).====Our results survive a battery of validity tests and robustness tests. We provide strong evidence supporting the common trends assumption by applying the event study framework to childhood height and pre-determined variables. Our estimates are robust to potential confounding factors, including other public infrastructures and health programs, the construction of sanitation facilities, and county-level socioeconomic development. We also show that our estimates are not sensitive to the possible issues of sample selection, reporting error in the data, and measurement error in the treatment variable, and are robust to making statistical inference using a permutation test. Furthermore, we provide evidence that neither negative weights nor treatment effect heterogeneity raises concerns over the interpretation of our DID estimates (de Chaisemartin and D’Haultfœuille, 2020).====This study contributes to the literature on the effect of improved water infrastructure on well-being. Improving access to safe drinking water is found to have positive short-term effects on the well-being of infants, children, and adults.==== Zhang (2012), the study most related to ours, explores the same rural drinking water program in China and shows that the introduction of treated tap water in villages has a strong immediate effect on the health status of both adults and children. However, the effect becomes much smaller and insignificant when village fixed effects are controlled for. In contrast, our study finds a strong and persistent effect of ==== tap water exposure when village fixed effects are controlled for.==== To the best of our knowledge, only two studies, which also explore the same rural drinking water program in China, assess the long-term effects of early-life exposure to tap water. Zhang and Xu (2016) find that individuals exposed to the program from age 0 to 2 had attained, on average, 1.68 additional years of education by early adulthood. Chen et al. (2022) find that exposure to tap water between conception and age five significantly enhances cognitive development at ages 10–15. In this study, we detect a positive and persistent effect of ==== exposure to tap water on childhood health, proffering improved childhood health as a potential pathway for the long-term impact on non-health outcomes. Moreover, we show that in the context where chemical pollutants in drinking water are likely to have more consequences than disease-causing microorganisms, the ==== period is the critical window for exposure to treated tap water to improve childhood health.====This study also extends the literature on the causal relationship between early-life conditions and human capital development. In the past two decades, the fetal origins literature has blossomed.==== Knowledge is expanding rapidly on the long-term effects of ==== conditions, but much less is known about the middle years between early life and adulthood (Almond et al., 2018). Our study fills some gaps in the missing evidence by focusing on the effects of early-life conditions on childhood outcomes. Moreover, our study enriches the knowledge on the interplay of public interventions in early life and household disadvantages. We find that exposure to treated water under the rural drinking water program has a much larger effect on the height of children of low-educated mothers, which supports the mitigating role of publicly provided treated water on household disadvantages. Finally, our study enhances the understanding of parents’ behavioral responses to early-life events. Whether parental responses undermine or magnify the immediate effect of early-life events is a long-standing debate, and the existing evidence is mixed (Almond and Mazumder, 2013). We show that parents increase health investments in response to their children’s exposure to tap water ====, which magnifies the baseline effect of the exposure.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides background information on the development of drinking water infrastructure in rural China and reviews the literature linking chemical pollutants in water with fetal development. Section 3 provides details about the data. Section 4 presents the event study analysis, the econometric specification used for the estimation, and the validity of the identification strategy.

How should such indirect policies be set? In this paper, we model the impact of efficiency incentives (EIs) on consumer behavior and analyze the normative implications of these policies in settings with internalities and externalities. We elucidate how the conditionally-optimal EI depends upon key empirical values and we also demonstrate how EIs can be paired with auxiliary policies to achieve optimality across various settings. Our analysis pinpoints the importance of the rebound effect in determining the net impact of the EI on externalities. Thus, our theoretical exposition provides concrete guidance for policy makers and program managers seeking to implement such policies. We further elucidate these theoretical insights through two empirical examples pertaining to air conditioner and refrigerator replacements.","Consumer energy efficiency incentives (EIs) are commonplace. In the United States, there are numerous state and federal programs offering tax credits for electric vehicles, rebates for efficient home appliances, and subsidies for home weatherization. These diverse programs share a common environmental impetus: reducing environmental impacts stemming from fuel or electricity use. However, none of these policies follow the standard Pigouvian pricing that is economically optimal for tackling externalities, instead targeting the energy efficiency of upstream durable goods.====In this paper, we ask: How should EIs be optimally set? We analyze the role and performance of EIs in three different settings: with internalities, with externalities, and with both.==== To this end, we construct a consumer model that endogenizes consumer investments in energy-efficient durables. We show that EIs can successfully mitigate behavioral failures from internalities, but that they tend to be suboptimal in settings with externalities because they create distortions between private goods and efficiency investments. Given this failure, we derive the (conditionally-)optimal EI for energy-efficient durables, which depends critically on the magnitude of the rebound effect. Throughout, we use the term “conditionally-optimal” for settings where the policymaker may be constrained to a single policy instrument targeting the durable good (i.e., a standalone EI), as opposed to a policy that targets the outcome of primary interest (e.g., Pigouvian price on emissions) or a policy package that couples the EI with other energy policies (i.e., a two-part instrument or 2PI).==== To our knowledge, no prior work has derived the conditionally-optimal EI. In an important class of cases, we find that EIs can actually be counterproductive and spur ==== energy use, and we show how these results are linked to extreme rebounds.====Our results have practical relevance given the prevalence of EIs in the real world. Energy efficiency has long been touted as a means of reducing resource extraction, mitigating pollution, and combating climate change. Yet market failures and behavioral failures may impede adoption of energy-efficient durables (Gillingham et al., 2009, Linares and Labandeira, 2010), which helps rationalize the prevalence of efficiency incentives. Utilities in the United States have spent billions of dollars encouraging customers to invest in energy efficiency (Loughran and Kulick, 2004, Auffhammer et al., 2008). The United States also offers federal tax credits for energy-efficient home improvements, such as certified heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems (Borenstein and Davis, 2016, Neveu and Sherlock, 2016). Similarly, both state and federal programs provide incentives for electric and hybrid vehicles. Our work investigates the potential and pitfalls of such policies. We demonstrate that EIs are, on their own, an imperfect remedy for environmental concerns and will deliver suboptimal outcomes. However, such policies can aptly address behavioral failures or credit and liquidity constraints, and they can also be coupled with other policies to deliver optimal outcomes.====Our work complements prior work on EIs, which analyzes participation, take-up, consumer behavior, and supply responses to EIs (Loughran and Kulick, 2004, Gillingham et al., 2006, Auffhammer et al., 2008, Gillingham et al., 2009, Carley, 2012). However, previous work focuses primarily on causal identification and ex post policy evaluations of existing policies rather than optimal tuning of policy instruments. There remains little guiding theory for how these interventions should be optimally formulated by decision-makers.==== We seek to fill this gap by providing a framework for analyzing and optimizing such policies, in line with the theory of the second-best (Bennear and Stavins, 2007). In this way, our work complements empirical investigations by delineating a cohesive theory for evaluating the performance of EI programs. This theory elucidates the objects of analysis that are important for welfare, thus helping to guide empirical investigations into fuel elasticities, efficiency elasticities, and rebound effects. We also provide normative insights into how policies should be designed according to the empirical magnitudes of these different objects.====Our analysis also dovetails with the rebound effects literature. We incorporate rebound effects into policy design by constructing and analyzing a micro-founded model that endogenizes rebound. Empirical work has focused primarily on estimating the size of rebound effects (see Gillingham et al. (2016) and van den Bergh (2011) for summaries of this large literature), while theoretical inquiry has sought to characterize and decompose rebound effects (Borenstein, 2015, Chan and Gillingham, 2015). We make a distinct contribution by explicitly evaluating how the rebound effect impacts policy design—an important gap in the extant literature. Prior research has examined rebound effects ==== policy,==== while our contribution considers the opposite: how should EI policies be designed to account for the rebound effect? To examine this, we construct a model that accommodates consumer efficiency choice and EIs while endogenizing the rebound effect. The typical rebound effect studied in the literature is based on an ==== change in efficiency (Chan and Gillingham, 2015). However, in many cases, the more relevant rebound effect is an endogenous one: the additional fuel usage spurred by incentivized efficiency improvements. Our model explicitly allows for these objects to be linked through the consumer maximization problem.====Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of our theoretical framework through an application to two real-world EI programs for refrigerator and air conditioner replacements in Mexico. Using data and results from Davis et al. (2014), we calculate the conditionally-optimal EIs for these two programs. Due to a difference in the magnitude of the rebound effect across the two programs, we find large differences in their optimal EIs. For the refrigerator program, we find that the original program’s EI is close to our estimate of a conditionally-optimal EI. In the air conditioner program, we find that the optimal EI should actually be a ==== rather than a subsidy because the incentive led to a large enough rebound to cause backfire (i.e., an increase in electricity use).====In what follows, we construct a simple model of energy consumption and energy efficiency choice in Section 2. Sections 3, 4, and 5 analyze the performance of EIs in three different settings: with internalities, with externalities, and with both. Section 6 discusses some of the model’s limitations. Section 7 applies our theoretical framework to two real-world EI programs for air conditioners and refrigerators. Section 8 discusses implications for policy and empirical research.",On consumer incentives for energy-efficient durables,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069623000311,27 March 2023,2023,Research Article,14.0

The reform introduced an unconventional Increasing Block Tariff featuring prices set according to annual cumulative consumption and a bimonthly billing cycle. Analyzing data from a household survey and administrative water bills, we detect a small effect on low-use households but find large water savings among high-use households. Moreover, we find strong evidence that high-use households respond to future price while current price remains fixed, and that the small share of households who appear myopic do not respond to dynamic incentives.","The welfare implications of many important economic policies are determined by consumers’ response to nonlinear prices. A vast literature concerns whether consumers respond at all to nonlinearities in their budget set, and which prices consumers respond to — marginal, average, or other.==== As consumption information is usually only available over a single budget period, the analysis of demand in the presence of nonlinear prices is typically static (Aron-Dine et al., 2015).==== Evidence is rare on the question: To what extent do consumers respond to the dynamic incentives created by nonlinear prices that vary within a single budget period? Analyzing the dynamic aspect of this response would be possible if information about intermediate consumption levels were available within a single budget period or by using the approach of dynamic modeling. Thus far, the discussion has been mostly limited to health insurance in the literature, and has not yielded a consensus.====In this study, we investigate the effect of an unconventional Increasing Block Tariff (IBT) on household water consumption and household response to the dynamic incentives it created. IBTs are commonly used nonlinear pricing schedules for goods such as electricity, water, or phone services, as well as in progressive tax schemes. We exploit a natural experiment arising from a water pricing reform beginning in January 2015 in Hangzhou, the capital city of Zhejiang Province in southeast China and one of the most economically vibrant cities in China. Prior to the reform, all households in Hangzhou had faced a low and flat rate that had been unchanged for ten years. The reform involved a transition from a flat rate to a three-tier IBT for a subgroup of households whose meters were directly administered by the water utility at the time of the reform. The other households were subject to a new flat rate that was 50% higher than the prior flat rate, which was nonetheless also nearly equivalent to the lowest tier rate in the new IBT. Using a difference-in-differences (DID) approach, we are able to isolate the effect of the IBT price structure on household water consumption, relative to the simple flat rate.====An ideal experiment for whether dynamic incentives matter in influencing households’ response to nonlinear prices would keep the current price fixed while generating variation in the future price (Aron-Dine et al., 2015). Three unique features of the pricing reform in Hangzhou come close to approximating such an ideal experiment. First, the budget period for the IBT is annual, while the billing cycle is bimonthly. Specifically, households subject to the IBT face a marginal price for water consumption that is based on their cumulative consumption up to that point in the year. That is, once their cumulative consumption up to that point in the year passes the threshold for the second tier (set at 216 m==== in the study setting), the higher price of the second tier is triggered, and they then face that new marginal price, until they cross the next threshold (which is set at 300 m====). At the end of the year, the marginal price then reverts back to the first-tier price, and again remains there as long as the household remains below the second-tier threshold in the second year. This feature introduces variation over time in the expected future price that high users face under the IBT. Second, the threshold for the second tier of the IBT is set high. Thus, for most households facing the IBT — all but the highest users — the current price remains constant at the level of the first tier. Third, for households facing the flat rate, the current and expected future prices remain the same and fixed throughout the year, regardless of household consumption level. Therefore, we are able to use a DID approach to examine the extent to which households respond to the dynamic incentives created by this type of IBT.====We construct a balanced panel data set of household water consumption from 2014 to 2016 by combining data from a household survey and administrative water billing records. The results suggest that on average, the IBT leads to a mild and insignificant drop in household water consumption. At first glance, this finding appears consistent with much of the literature that shows that IBTs fail to effectively incentivize conservation (see, e.g., Wichman (2014)). We then examine household response in two subsamples, divided by household baseline annual water consumption level: low-use households (baseline below the median), and high-use households (baseline above the median). To test whether results are sensitive to outliers in the distribution of pre-reform consumption, we also consider a third subsample of moderately high-use households (baseline above the median and less than the second-tier threshold of the annual IBT), that excludes the highest users. Parsing the sample in this way, we detect a small and insignificant effect of the IBT on the water consumption of low-use households, while we find significant water savings among high-use and moderately high-use households. On average, the IBT lowers household water consumption by 0.047 m==== a day for a high-use household. When we focus on the moderately high-use households, the water savings effect is smaller but remains statistically significant. Moreover, in all three subsamples, the effect of the IBT increases in the second year of implementation, suggesting a greater long-term effect than the short-term effect observed in 2015.====Further analysis reveals other interesting patterns in the data. For high-use households facing the IBT, the water savings effect of the IBT starts early in the year when they are still far from the second-tier threshold and the budget renewal date. Importantly, we also find that for moderately high-use households facing the IBT, water saving is especially high in the middle of the year, despite these households’ high likelihood of remaining at a constant current price throughout the budget period. We take this as strong evidence that such households incorporate even a small risk of future price increases into their current water consumption decisions. In contrast, for low-use households, in the initial period of the budget period, the IBT does not result in any difference in water consumption between those facing the IBT and those facing the flat rate. This is in line with expectations because the expected future price will always be the same as the current price for such households. In addition, at year’s end when the water budget is about to be renewed, the IBT leads to a significant increase in water consumption. Though the mechanism for this apparent behavioral response is unclear, it may indicate that a high remaining “balance” at year’s end drives low-use households towards over-consuming water later in the year.====Additional heterogeneity analysis reveals substantial differences in the IBT effect across subgroups of high-use households. We detect little water savings among IBT households who appear highly present-minded, suggesting that future-oriented time preferences play a role in response to the dynamic incentives of this IBT design. We also find that the water conservation effect of the IBT among high-use households is greater when households have less-educated members, fewer members, or larger housing area per capita. Dropping extremely high-use households does not alter these patterns. Moreover, our results survive a series of robustness checks, including imposing alternative sample restrictions, using alternative thresholds for defining high-use households, using alternative specifications, using a data set constructed at the monthly level, accounting for measurement error in meter reading dates, and dealing with the possible truncation of non-IBT households. Finally, an alternative identification strategy that investigates consumption only among IBT households suggests that this price change significantly narrows the gap in water consumption between high- and low-use households.====Besides extending the literature on consumers’ response to nonlinear budget sets, our study fits in the vast empirical literature that investigates the effect of price or non-price interventions on resource conservation. Nonlinear pricing (Olmstead, 2009, Szabó, 2015) and individualized rates (Smith, 2022) are employed as price interventions. Recently, a growing body of literature explores the impact of non-price interventions, and the interactions of price and non-price interventions.==== In this study, we evaluate a pure water price intervention. As there is no change in the format and frequency of water bills before and after the reform, we are able to rule out the possible confounding effect of non-price factors. We show that even in a context where water spending amounts to a small fraction of household income, the change in water pricing structure can induce significant water conservation among high-use households.====More specifically, our study also relates to empirical tests of the effects of IBTs on water consumption. To our knowledge, only two studies have isolated the causal link between IBTs and residential water consumption. Exploiting the introduction of a third price tier in an IBT for water in Santa Cruz, California, Nataraj and Hanemann (2011) find that doubling marginal price leads to a 12% decrease in water use among high-use households. Examining the conversion from a flat tariff to an IBT in North Carolina, Wichman (2014) provides heterogeneous price elasticity estimates and finds that the transition to an IBT may increase water consumption due to price decreases in the lower tiers. Due to the distinct design of each IBT and differences in the contexts in which they are applied, additional studies are worthwhile. In addition, our study is the first to consider an unconventional IBT for water pricing in which the budget is renewed only annually. This type of IBT is prevalent in China but rare elsewhere. In recent years, IBTs have been widely implemented across cities in China, to support the government’s goal of encouraging water use efficiency while ensuring fair access to water.==== By 2019, 34 of the 36 major cities had transitioned to some form of an IBT. Among them, 21 major cities including Hangzhou (with a collective population of 145.7 million) were using an IBT with a water budget that is renewed annually. The effects of such an annual IBT design have not yet been discussed. Understanding whether and how this particular IBT design supports the Chinese government’s water conservation goals is critically important for policy makers there, and for those in other counties facing similar water scarcity problems.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss the time line and structure of the water pricing reform as implemented in Hangzhou. Section 3 describes the research design and the data we use.

Our findings suggest that wildfires have caused more mortgage arrears in severely damaged areas, with both economic and statistical significance. For other areas with relatively minor damage, the increase in arrears is small and statistically insignificant.","Global climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of natural disasters. OECD (2003) highlighted this as an emerging risk in the 21st century. These disasters destroy physical assets, such as homes, which have detrimental financial implications for the affected individuals. A recent report by The Insurance Institute of Canada (2020) highlights that extreme weather will impact every area of insurance with the following risks: more people and assets are in the path of weather-related losses, which results in ====; climate change accountability leads to ====; and changes needed in response to climate change create ====.====The aforementioned climate-related risks also affect the stability of the financial system. The Network for Greening the Financial System, an international network of 87 central banks, recommends that central banks and supervisors integrate climate-related risks into financial stability monitoring and microsupervision (NGFS, 2019).==== Uncertainty related to the climate also increases the difficulty of assessing its potential economic impacts (Burke et al., 2015). Understanding the potential effects of natural disasters, which have become more frequent and severe due to climate change, on household finance is particularly important in Canada because elevated household indebtedness has already been identified as a vulnerability in the financial system (Cateau et al., 2015).====We conducted an empirical case study of the impact of the 2016 Fort McMurray Wildfire, the costliest wildfire disaster in Canadian history. According to Statistics Canada (2017), 5890 km==== of land and approximately 8% of all private dwellings were destroyed by the fire, making this the largest insured loss for insurance providers. This disaster also created substantial indirect costs as the evacuation temporarily halted oil–sand production near Fort McMurray. The estimated output loss was 0.4% of real GDP in the second quarter of 2016. The wildfire’s total cost is estimated at $9.9 billion Canadian dollars, with about $3.7 billion in insured losses.====Wildfires offer a unique opportunity for an in-depth analysis of the economic consequences of natural disasters. This incident resulted in uneven destruction within Fort McMurray. The wildfires severely burned some areas, while evacuated residents residing in less damaged areas were able to return home the following month. This differential impact allows us to identify the severity of the direct impact on individuals with property losses versus those with relatively indirect effects.====Using detailed monthly consumer credit data from 2014 to 2018, we categorized individuals into two groups based on whether they lived in (1) severely damaged areas or (2) less damaged areas and analyzed the economic effects of wildfires on these groups separately. We focus on financial distress in insured mortgages measured by loan delinquency for the following reasons. First, residential properties are immobile and vulnerable to damage from natural disasters. Second, mortgages are the single largest loan item for most individuals. Third, the effect of natural disasters on mortgage delinquency has strong implications for mortgage insurers, financial institutions, and policymakers providing explicit guarantees via mortgage insurance.====The wildfire’s treatment effect is estimated using a synthetic control method (SCM). This method is often used for policy evaluations in finance, economics, and political science. It aims to create a hypothetical control unit that resembles Fort McMurray’s characteristics, yet never experiences wildfires. The treatment effect is measured as the difference in mortgage arrears between the actual and hypothetical control outcomes. We find that wildfires have a substantial impact on mortgage delinquencies. After controlling for confounding effects, such as oil price changes, we attribute the doubling of delinquencies in severely damaged areas almost entirely to the wildfire effect. However, this increase was temporary and quickly dissipated between 12 and 18 months after the event. In contrast, we find minor and statistically insignificant effects in areas with less damage, with these impacts dissipating after only three months.====Our findings highlight the need to account for climate risk in consumers’ lending decisions, as there may be spillovers to other finance and insurance industry stakeholders. Spillovers can appear in terms of an increase in the financial burden due to the loss of use, delay in insurance settlements, or disruption in income streams. It is incumbent on the finance and insurance to understand and manage their exposure to these risks. A potential reason for credit performance worsening is limited risk sharing (Favilukis et al., 2017), as households fail to insure against catastrophic risks due to prohibitively high insurance prices (Kousky and Cooke, 2012) or whole market failure in equilibrium (Raykov, 2014). Our findings support recent research that suggests the need to account for climate risk in the pricing of assets and bonds (refer to Gollier, 2014, Pedersen et al., 2020, Bolton and Kacperczyk, 2020, Flammer, 2021).====Potential changes in pricing may have long-lasting effects on the Canadian housing finance system because the public securitization of insured mortgages provides a cost-effective supply of funding to lenders, supporting competition in the mortgage market (Mordel and Stephens, 2015). This study also highlights the need for preparedness for natural disasters, which may be in the form of debt forbearance or debt-relief programs from the finance industry, or disaster relief from the public sector.====This study is closely related to the growing literature on the effects of natural disasters. Gallagher and Hartley (2017) find a temporary and modest increase in mortgage delinquency after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. This outcome can be explained by a small and transitory effect on income (Deryugina et al., 2018), which can be attributed to wage gains from a weaker labor supply as residents migrate out of the affected areas (Groen et al., 2020). Regarding the distribution of federal flood assistance for Hurricane Harvey, Billings et al. (2019) argue that fewer assistance loans are allocated to financially constrained homeowners, resulting in more insolvency. In the long run, Ratcliffe et al. (2020) suggests that natural disasters lead to declines in credit scores and loan performance. Overall, the impacts of natural disasters vary significantly owing to differences in severity, disaster aid levels, media coverage, and political interest (Edmiston, 2017, Issler et al., 2019). Individuals can obtain sufficient liquidity from other channels (Morse, 2011). Recently, Paudel (2021b) suggests that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) reduced the number of human-induced forest fires and Bilyk et al. (2020) examines how the COVID 19 shock affects Canadian households by comparing the pandemic and natural disasters. In addition to household finance, catastrophic disasters may also affect bank funding and reduce the supply of loans (Hosono et al., 2016) as well as firm survival (Basker and Miranda, 2017). From a macroeconomic perspective, Cavallo et al. (2013) utilized SCM to study the impact of catastrophic natural disasters on economic growth. The author did not find any significant effects.====Our work differs from the existing literature in several ways. Unlike floods and hurricanes, wildfires are arguably unpredictable in terms of geographical location. Households may be less prepared than those living i n floodplains or coastal areas. Unlike Hurricane Katrina’s extensive damage to New Orleans’ oil-producing facilities, oil–sand production surrounding Fort McMurray was only temporarily halted, which prevented the effect from propagating through supply chains (Barrot and Sauvagnat, 2016, Hsu et al., 2018) and limited the loss of jobs to a transitory income shock. The distinct pattern of wildfire damage also enables us to better quantify the losses from the physical risks of a natural disaster. Namely, the heterogeneous impacts across different neighborhoods in Fort McMurray allow us to study the treatment effect based on the intensity level of the damage. This approach provides the advantage of using synthetic control over a difference-in-differences setup, which requires splitting the control and treatment groups at the boundary of the event. Finally, our focus on insured mortgages at a monthly frequency also offers new insights for risk management on the evolution of mortgage arrears compared to previous studies using quarterly or annual data.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides background information on the 2016 Fort McMurray Wildfire, Section 3 describes our data set and reports relevant stylized facts, Section 4 specifies the empirical methodology, Section 5 presents the results on loan defaults, and Section 6 concludes the study description.",We didn’t start the fire: Effects of a natural disaster on consumers’ financial distress,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069623000086,17 March 2023,2023,Research Article,16.0

I investigate the effects of a restriction termed ‘mandatory rationing’ on residential water consumers who face differential exposure to the content of the policy. I find a significant response among households who were likely to be fined, but also among households with low likelihood of facing penalties. I provide evidence that this occurs because the policy directly affected consumption through non-price channels. My findings show that fine-based policies can have impacts beyond the targeted population as a result.","Financial penalties are both widely used in conservation policy and extensively studied in the economics literature. While such penalties are mathematically equivalent to a price increase, existing theory (Becker, 1993, Sandel, 2009) and empirical research (Gneezy and Rustichini, 2000, Li et al., 2014) highlight the fact that these penalties may produce different results than a simple change in price. The mechanisms by which financial penalties or incentives affect behavior include price-based mechanisms, but they also include stigma, impacts on intrinsic motivation, and other non-price channels (Faure and Escresa, 2011, Gneezy et al., 2011).====There is an emerging strand of literature which identifies the crowding-out or crowding-in of norms and intrinsic motivations (For a review, see: Rode et al., 2015). While many highlight the crowding-out of intrinsic motivations by price-based interventions (Titmuss, 1970, Gneezy and Rustichini, 2000, Gneezy et al., 2011), the findings presented in this paper are suggestive of not simply a lack of crowding-out but a crowding-in of norms and social pressure to contribute to the public good. My results parallel Smith (2018), which found that the price channel of a price-based intervention in groundwater extraction and conservation was only able to explain approximately 74 percent of the reduced pumping, attributing the remaining 26 percent to crowding-in of conservation norms. Like Smith (2018), I observe that the behavioral change in my setting cannot be completely captured by price-based mechanisms. In fact, non-price mechanisms may explain the majority of the overall policy impact in this context.====Using the context of residential water restrictions during drought, I examine how large fines on a target population can cause meaningful responses both among targeted households and outside of that target population. In this paper, I consider how financial penalties can affect behavior through non-price mechanisms, ranging from peer effects to social pressure. To provide insight into how a fine-based policy affects individuals separately from fine avoidance behavior, I need to observe responses among individuals who face the signal of the fine without the financial and other consequences of the fine itself. I provide this context by examining a municipal quota-based policy, backed by fines, intended to generate water conservation during exceptional drought conditions in coastal California. The structure of the financial penalty, which was imposed on households consuming beyond a uniformly specified allotment, allows for examining the consequences of the policy on households who faced the signal of the fine-based policy without the direct consequences of the fines themselves.====I use a difference-in-differences methodology that leverages matching across an arbitrary boundary between two water districts with contrasting policies. I am able to generate individual difference-in-differences estimates and then identify the heterogeneity in these estimates with respect to indicators of exposure to the policy. This allows me to illustrate the average policy response among households with a low risk of being fined and among households throughout the distribution of fine risk. A key contribution of this research is the ability to examine the effect of fines on contributions to a public good among individuals who were subject to a policy but unlikely to face fines themselves.====The reduced-form results from this exercise not only demonstrate that the policy was effective but also highlight the relative similarity of the response among households with very different probabilities of facing fines. Households in the treated district at the fifth decile of consumption during the summer prior to the policy reduced consumption by 3.9 percent, while those in the eighth decile of prior consumption responded by 7.5 percent. This is despite the fact that those households in the fifth decile consumed, on average, 71 percent of the threshold in the prior summer, while those in the eighth decile consumed, on average, 106 percent of the threshold in the prior summer. Likewise, in terms of predicted consumption in summer 2014, households with a predicted consumption of 40 percent of the penalty threshold reduced consumption by over 3 percent. Considering matched East district households as the counterfactual, 89 percent of households in the estimation sample were projected to face no penalties, and this group reduced consumption by 3.8 percent in spite of this.====The consequence is that a fine equivalent to increasing the marginal price only for high consumption by 25 to 50 dollars (382 to 763 percent) per hundred cubic feet of water induced a similar aggregate response to what would be predicted from a 37 percent increase in prices for all households, in addition to the price effects for households directly affected.==== In average prices, the fine was equivalent to an increase between 2.77 and 15 dollars (54 to 299 percent) per hundred cubic feet of water for high-consuming households.====Given these findings, it is important to consider what factors might explain these behavioral changes. I provide evidence to suggest that two overlapping non-price mechanisms are driving this result. The first is that household responses to the policy are correlated with the exposure of the neighborhood surrounding the household. This indicates that there may be peer effects or spatial spillovers, which may operate through either technology diffusion or the second and related mechanism, social pressure. There is evidence to suggest that the penalty-based policy ‘crowded-in’ social norms related to water consumption and conservation, inducing a direct disutility of consuming water and reduced demand. These normative impacts may operate through the criminal stigmatization of water or internalization of water conservation as an important contribution to the public good.====Alternative potential explanations could include risk aversion, over-weighting of low-probability events, uncertainty, and incorrect beliefs about own consumption. The structure of billing for water consumption might suggest that households are not perfectly informed about their consumption. However, the institutional setting includes extensive effort by the water district to provide all necessary information, and the results are not consistent with imperfect information as the primary mechanism.==== In a related vein, Homonoff (2018) attributes a large response to a relatively small tax on disposable plastic bags to loss aversion, as discussed in Tversky and Kahneman (1992), noting that a subsidy of similar size was substantially less effective. However, risk aversion, over-weighting of low-probability events, general uncertainty, and biased beliefs about own consumption all would generally require usage reductions among high-usage households far greater in magnitude than those observed. This is because the financial penalty grows linearly in consumption, and the average price a household faces is also an increasing function of consumption in this area of the distribution.====The implications of these results are important for optimal policy design, especially for policies targeting resource conservation and other contributions to public goods. This study builds on the existing optimal fines literature by contributing empirical evidence for the importance of non-price mechanisms (See, for example: Becker, 1993, Polinsky and Shavell, 1979). It is important for policymakers considering whether or not to impose fines, or to employ a different policy mechanism, to consider not only the fine avoidance behavior, but also the aggregate effect of fines on the population. This may cause a change in optimal policy choice, especially when the policymaker faces institutional constraints.====This paper is related to a literature in law and economics that considers the ‘expressive’ effect of the law (McAdams, 1997, Cooper, 1998, McAdams, 2000). Theoretically, the expressive effect of the law is the impact a law has through its impact not on financial incentives or incentives to avoid prison, but on social norms and, potentially, individuals’ preferences. Expressive effects of public policy are separate from – and additional to – any impacts that a policy may have through changes in financial or legal incentives. The results presented in this paper speak to such a separate channel for the policy studied and contribute to the empirical literature on the topic. In one recent working paper, Rees-Jones and Rozema (2020) explicitly consider this expressive effect among the non-price impacts of sin taxes.====This paper also contributes to the literature on over-compliance with environmental regulation. Shimshack and Ward (2008) present evidence in a firm emissions setting that over-compliance is driven by regulation of other emissions jointly produced and by uncertainty. In contrast, my setting provides evidence of over-compliance that cannot be explained by regulation of other related consequences of the regulated decision. Similarly, I provide evidence that this over-compliance by households is inconsistent with a pure uncertainty and risk aversion explanation. Levels of risk aversion necessary to explain the over-compliance are inconsistent with observed consumption and pricing. While Brännlund and Löfgren (1996) ascribe over-compliance to uncertainty, my results are more consistent with McClelland and Horowitz (1999), who find that over-compliance is the result of some direct benefit, rather than uncertainty.====In addition, this paper contributes to the extensive literature on utility policy and demand management. Residential demand for utilities is notably price inelastic, with estimates in the literature generally falling between −0.04 and −0.33 (Pint, 1999, Olmstead et al., 2007, Ito, 2013, Ito, 2014, Wichman et al., 2016, Auffhammer and Rubin, 2018), and several authors have demonstrated that non-price channels are important for conservation policy in both the electricity (Allcott, 2011, Allcott and Rogers, 2014, Asensio and Delmas, 2015) and water sectors (Ferraro and Price, 2013, Brent et al., 2015). As utilities turn to non-price mechanisms to generate conservation, this work expands on a growing literature documenting which conservation policies work for residential water consumption and why these policies are successful.====Existing work has established that many demand management programs, including messaging, outdoor watering restrictions, and small price increases, create only modest conservation gains with substantial heterogeneity in effectiveness (See, for example: Bruvold, 1979, Renwick and Archibald, 1998, Renwick and Green, 2000, Ferraro and Miranda, 2013, Wichman et al., 2016, Wichman, 2017). In particular, several studies have examined a closely related policy of restricting outdoor watering, a form of partial rationing which typically focuses on timing rather than quantity, providing evidence that such policies can reduce welfare by restricting choice and produce mixed results in terms of conservation (See, for example: Hensher et al., 2006, Grafton and Ward, 2008, Fielding et al., 2012, Mansur and Olmstead, 2012, Castledine et al., 2014, Browne et al., 2021). The policy in this study, however, provides households with freedom to choose how to achieve overall consumption restrictions across indoor and outdoor usage, as well as a direct method to pay for consumption beyond the allotted threshold.====This study also builds on Renwick and Green (2000) and Bruvold (1979), who examine restrictions placed on total consumption by households using aggregate data. To the author’s knowledge, this paper is the first study to use household-level panel data from two service areas separated by an arbitrary boundary to examine restrictions on the total combined indoor and outdoor consumption by households, which is a relatively rare tool but increasingly under consideration in the most drought-prone areas of the world. As a contribution to our understanding of how conservation policies, and fine-based rationing policies in particular, impact consumers, this information is increasingly important for water managers, as well as policymakers in other areas of conservation, who are considering which policies to implement.",A fine is more than a price: Evidence from drought restrictions,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009506962300027X,16 March 2023,2023,Research Article,17.0

Such countries host almost 40% of the world’s population and face inherently different environmental, demographic, and socio-economic conditions than their counterparts in temperate areas. Using detailed data from all Colombian municipalities, I show that anomalously hot or cold days increase mortality even at narrow temperature ranges, which are characteristic of the tropics. An additional day with a mean temperature above 27 °C (80.6 ====F) increases mortality rates by approximately 0.24 deaths per 100,000, equivalent to 0.7% of monthly death rates. Unlike temperate locations, I find that deaths attributed to infectious diseases and respiratory illnesses drive this relationship in the hot part of the distribution, mainly affecting children aged 0–9. These findings uncover new factors and populations at risk and imply that the average person who dies after a hot temperature shock loses approximately 30 years of life. I also provide evidence that access to health care and quality of services could mediate between temperature and mortality.","The changing climate has spurred a large literature examining the effects of short-term variations in temperature on a number of economic and health outcomes, including morbidity and mortality.==== Several papers have documented that instances of extreme heat and cold increase human mortality, resulting in a ‘U’-shape relationship between the two over a wide range of temperatures with close to zero effect at mild temperatures (Deschênes and Greenstone, 2011, Barreca et al., 2016, Burgess et al., 2011, Carleton et al., 2018, Heutel et al., 2021, Cohen and Dechezleprêtre, 2022). However, most of this knowledge comes from countries located in temperate latitudes, such as the U.S. or China, where extreme temperatures are observed during winters and summers.==== Populations in tropical latitudes, on the contrary, are subject to narrow ranges of temperature throughout the year due to the lack of seasonal variation given their closeness to the Equator. Extending the estimates from the temperate region would suggest close to zero effects in mortality from weather shocks in many tropical places where temperatures remain almost constant at ‘mild’ levels throughout the year.====This paper documents the relationship between temperature and mortality in a tropical country, provides evidence on the underlying mechanisms and suggests adaptation opportunities through access to health services. Understanding how mortality reacts to temperature shocks in such a setting is essential because the tropics hosts almost 40% of the world’s population and 55% of children under five years old, both shares expected to increase to approximately 50% and 60% respectively by 2050 (Edelman et al., 2014). Moreover, populations in these latitudes are expected to bear much of the effects of climate change (Parry et al., 2007). However, the lack of comprehensive datasets in tropical countries has limited our knowledge of how mortality reacts to variations in temperature in these settings and, more so, of the type of technologies and policies that could help mitigate the human health costs associated with climate change.====I use a unique and novel data set that combines monthly Vital Statistics from all Colombian municipalities from 1993–2016 with high-resolution meteorological data that produces a balanced panel with close to 300,000 observations. This allows me to exploit monthly variation within municipality and include municipality-by-year and month-by-year fixed effects to account for most sources of unobserved heterogeneity. The data’s time span and frequency also allow me to control for the possibility of inter-temporal mortality displacement by including lagged temperature variables and estimating cumulative effects. I merge this data with administrative records on the percentage of the population by municipality covered by some form of health insurance to measure access to the health care system. I also use records on the number of legal claims (==== in Spanish) made to courts against health insurers when there are problems with service delivery to construct quality measures of health services. ==== are frequently used by individuals because it is low-cost and an expedite way to enforce access to restricted health services. Because of their prevalence, regulators and the Ministry of Health also use the number of claims to construct measures of insurer performance and quality.====I find that even at narrow temperature ranges, characteristic of the tropics, anomalously hot or cold days increase mortality, suggesting that even small variations in mild temperatures can affect human health. Deaths attributed to infectious and respiratory illness mainly explain the effects documented at the hot end of the temperature distribution, primarily affecting children aged 0 to 9. I provide suggestive evidence that access to health care and good quality services are important in mitigating temperature-related mortality risks. These are novel findings because they uncover new populations and risk factors associated with heat-related mortality. They also shed light on possible adaptation strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change and the importance of health care provision and good quality services on resilience to temperature shocks. To my knowledge, this is the first paper to assess the importance of the quality of health services as a mediating factor between temperature and mortality.====Specifically, I find that an additional day with a mean temperature below 17 ====C (62.6 ====F) or above 27 ====C (80.6 ====F) increases monthly mortality rates by approximately 0.24 and 0.16 deaths per 100,000, respectively, equivalent to 0.62% and 0.43% of monthly death rates. Put another way, a day below 17 ====C in this setting has a higher effect than what Barreca et al. (2016) find for an additional day below 4 ====C for the U.S, or what Cohen and Dechezleprêtre (2022) find for Mexico for an additional day below 17 ====C. At 17 ====C, estimates for the U.S. are very close to zero and to 0.2% for Mexico. On the hot part of the temperature distribution, an additional day above 27 ====C in my setting has a similar effect to a day between 27–32 ====C in the U.S. over the period 1931–1959 (0.37%), and much higher to more recent estimates.====These estimates correspond to cumulative effects of temperature shocks after an exposure window of five months. Including additional lags beyond five months, I find that mortality not only reacts to unusually ‘cold’ or hot days contemporaneously but peaks after an exposure window of five and seven months, respectively. An additional day above 27 ====C increases mortality by 0.27 deaths per 100,000 after seven months, corresponding to a 0.72% effect. After accounting for the possibility of delayed effects of hot temperature shocks, mortality increases much more than estimates for the U.S. or Mexico.====These findings imply that hotter-than-average days have a longer window of delayed effects than what has been documented thus far. I contribute to the literature that studies how temperature shocks propagate over time. Evidence regarding near-term mortality displacement, also referred to as ‘harvesting’ and understood as the idea that deaths caused by a contemporaneous weather shock could be compensated by a subsequent fall in mortality over the following days or weeks, is mixed. Deschenes and Moretti (2009) show that in the U.S., harvesting is substantial after heat shocks meaning that effects are close to zero after an exposure window of 30 days. In contrast, Cohen and Dechezleprêtre (2022) find that heat effects in Mexico are still significant after 30 days, and Barreca et al. (2016) find that U.S. estimates remain virtually unchanged after two months.====Tropical countries differ in environmental, socio-demographic, and economic conditions, which could trigger differential responses in the temperature-mortality relationship than their temperate region counterparts. First, the temperature in tropical areas exhibits no seasonality as typically observed in temperate countries, implying that populations are exposed to narrow and constant temperature ranges throughout the year. For the U.S., there is evidence of harmful ‘de-adaptation’ to infrequently experienced temperatures (Heutel et al., 2021), suggesting that higher mortality risks could arise even at the mild end points of a narrow temperature distribution if those temperatures are not experienced very often.====Second, differences in the underlying causes of death that give rise to the temperature-mortality response function might differ between latitudes. For example, tropical environments are more hospitable to human diseases, given the absence of winter temperatures (Kamarck et al., 1976). These diseases include, among others, those related to respiratory and infectious illnesses that involve viruses and bacteria. Evidence from the epidemiology literature suggests that higher-than-average temperature shocks aid in replicating microbes causing human diseases and subsequently increasing viral transmission (Council et al., 2001). For example, Hii et al. (2009) show that dengue incidence increased after the occurrence of high temperatures in Singapore. Unlike temperate areas, these factors in tropical climates might pose additional risks to human health after temperature shocks and explain the differences documented thus far. If this is the case, policies and technologies that could be appropriate for temperate countries to adapt to temperature shocks might not necessarily be cost-effective for tropical areas.====Finally, the literature highlights the importance of income in shaping the relationship between temperature and mortality (Carleton et al., 2018). Since the tropics tend to host low and middle-income countries, differential responses could also be expected. Lower-income populations are also expected to bear much of the effects of temperature shocks, mainly because of their lower adaptive capacity (Cohen and Dechezleprêtre, 2022). Understanding adaptation strategies, or technologies that could be readily available and incentivized by public policy, such as access to health care and quality, could be essential to understand how we can mediate the adverse effects of temperature shocks.====Having established that mortality reacts to changes in temperature, I investigate whether differences in relevant causes of death and populations at risk give rise to the temperature-mortality response function previously described. I find that mortality effects are unequally distributed across causes of death and age groups. Heat-related mortality is mainly attributed to respiratory and infectious diseases, with an additional day above 27 ====C increasing specific-cause mortality rates by 2.7% and 2.0%, respectively. As for age groups, children aged zero to nine are at higher risk after hot temperature shocks.====I uncover new populations and risk factors associated with heat-related mortality. Most studies have identified infants (0–1) and the elderly as the main risk groups (White, 2017, Cohen and Dechezleprêtre, 2022, Yu et al., 2019). I find an overall effect on children, with deaths associated with respiratory and infectious diseases playing a significant role. Respiratory and infectious-related deaths include those associated with diseases such as whooping cough, flu, malaria, dengue, zika, and tuberculosis, among others. Temperature and extreme climate events have been associated with the proliferation of such viruses and bacteria (e.g. vector, water-borne, etc.), and especially to tropical diseases that thrive in hot and humid conditions (Gasparrini et al., 2015).====In contrast, the economics literature has identified cardiovascular diseases as the leading cause of heat-related mortality (Deschenes and Moretti, 2009, Cohen and Dechezleprêtre, 2022, Deschenes, 2014, Yu et al., 2019). This is likely due to viruses and bacteria being less prominent in the temperate region (Kamarck et al., 1976). For example, deaths associated with infectious diseases are close to zero in the U.S. Deschenes and Moretti (2009). These insights are consistent with the finding that hot-temperature shocks have delayed effects and take up to an exposure window of seven months to translate into mortality effects. Consistent with the epidemiological finding that the proliferation and contagion of infectious and respiratory diseases are influenced by population density, I also find that urban and rich municipalities drive the effects of heat-related mortality.====I further investigate whether the response function evolved over time to shed some light on possible adaptation behaviors. Overall, I find a 55% decline in cold-related mortality over 1993–2016, while heat-related mortality increased throughout the period. This is a novel finding since studies in the U.S. have found a decline in heat-related mortality over the 20th century, mainly attributed to the diffusion of residential air conditioning. Access to such technology reduces stress in people’s thermoregulatory systems and, thus, deaths associated with cardiovascular diseases (Barreca et al., 2016).====I explore the role of access and quality of health care as a modifier of the response function. I use the distribution of ==== rate by insurer to construct a quality measure by determining whether complaints per 1000 inhabitants fell above or below the ==== or the ==== percentile of the distribution of complaints rate at the baseline year. Estimates in magnitude are larger for days below 17 ====C. However, effects on the hot end of the temperature distribution are significant, suggesting that access and especially good quality health services could help mitigate the adverse effects of hot temperature days on mortality. I contribute to the literature that documents the importance of access to health care as an adaptation policy to climate change (Mullins and White, 2020, and Cohen and Dechezleprêtre, 2022).====The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the data sources, the main characteristics of temperature and mortality in Colombia and summary statistics that inform the empirical strategy. Section 3 outlines the econometric models used to estimate the temperature-mortality response function. Section 4 discusses the main results from fitting baseline regressions, heterogeneous findings, the evolution of the relationship throughout the years in the sample, and the role of access and quality of health services as a mediating factor on the temperature-mortality response function. Section 5 concludes and discusses the policy implications of the findings.","Into the tropics: Temperature, mortality, and access to health care in Colombia",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069623000141,4 March 2023,2023,Research Article,18.0

In the U.S. and Europe, such delays have been attributed primarily to increases in market concentration, airport congestion, and weather shocks (Deshpande and Arıkan, 2012; Mayer and Sinai, 2003; Santos and Robin, 2010).

Although research has linked air pollution to adverse health consequences (Chay and Greenstone, 2003; Chen et al., 2013; Lelieveld et al., 2015), impaired cognitive performance (Carneiro et al., 2021; Ebenstein et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2018), reduced labor supply (Hanna and Oliva, 2015), lower work productivity (He et al., 2019; Zivin and Neidell, 2012), decreased happiness (Zhang et al., 2017; Zheng et al., 2019), and road traffic accidents (Sager, 2019), the relationship between air pollution and flight delays or cancellations has not been quantitatively assessed.====In this paper, using a newly-compiled dataset of airport traffic, air pollution, and weather from 2015 to 2017, we evaluate the impacts of air pollution on flight departure delays in China. There are several reasons for this focus. First, China has become the world's largest aviation market, with over 610 million passengers carried every year since 2017 (The World Bank, 2018). Second, flight delays have become a pressing issue in China. According to the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), approximately 8% of the total departures (∼243 thousand flights) were delayed for more than 2 h in 2017 in large Chinese airports that transport over 10 million passengers each year. Flight delays routinely account for about 50% of all customer complaints to the CAAC (). Finally, despite significant progress in reducing pollution emissions (Zhang et al., 2019), major Chinese cities such as Beijing and Shanghai still rank among the most polluted in the world. Hundreds of flights were either severely delayed or canceled daily in the winters of 2012, 2013, and 2016, as air pollution shrouded these two cities (Tang and Hoshiko, 2013; Zhuang, 2016).====Air pollution may cause flight delays or cancellations for two possible reasons. First, particulate matter can reduce atmospheric visibility (Hyslop, 2009). Poor visibility at airports can downgrade the capacity of an airport and therefore lead to delays or cancellations of departing flights. Second, air pollution reduces the cognitive performance of airport ground crew and airline cabin crew, which may increase the possibility of flights being delayed or cancelled. Several studies document negative correlations between air pollution and cognitive performance (Carneiro et al., 2021; Ebenstein et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2018). Ebenstein et al. (2016) find that transitory PM==== exposure is associated with a significant decline in student academic performance. Thus, short-term exposure to PM==== is expected to negatively affect cognitive performance of airport ground and cabin crews. Because efficient air transportation is a complex task that requires tight coordination among airport ground and cabin crews, the efficiency of airport operations could be significantly reduced by air pollution. However, the literature has so far overlooked the potential impact of air pollution on flight delays.====In this study, we first investigate the impact of air pollution, measured as the daily average concentrations of PM==== on flight departure delays in China between 2015 and 2017. Second, we assess the extent to which improved air quality induced by more stringent air pollution policies contributed to the change in flight delays in China from 2015 to 2017. China has been undertaking aggressive actions to combat air pollution since the promulgation of the “Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan” in 2013. Significant declines in PM==== concentrations have been observed nationwide from 2013 to 2017. (Zhang et al., 2019). The answer to our second research question provides critical information about the potential gains from improving air quality in China.====The dataset used in our analysis contains flight-level information for all domestic and international air carriers landing at or departing from airports in North China (including Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Inner Mongolia and Shanxi provinces) from April 1, 2015 to September 30, 2017. We use two methods to measure flight departure delays. We first calculate a flight's ==== delay based on its actual and scheduled departure times. For flights with previous assignments, we deduct these flights' arrival delays from the gross delays to calculate ==== flight delays in the current assignment. Because the raw high-frequency flight-by-flight dataset has a considerable number of missing observations, following Schlenker and Walker (2016), we aggregate the ==== (or ====) delays of individual flights to obtain daily total flight delays at the airport level; we then measure flight delays using daily average delay per flight (= daily total flight delays/daily total number of flights).====Estimation of the impacts of pollution on flight delays is challenging because airports constitute a major source of air pollutants. Airport runway congestion due to bad weather, network delays, or air traffic controls contributes significantly to local air pollution (Schlenker and Walker, 2016). To credibly identify the causal effects of PM==== on flight departure delays, we use two instrumental variable (IV) strategies, where we rely on changes in atmospheric thermal inversions and wind direction as exogenous shocks to local pollution levels. Prior studies have used thermal inversions as an instrument for PM==== when estimating the effects of PM==== on a wide range of outcomes, such as health (Arceo et al., 2016; Jans et al., 2018), productivity (Fu et al., 2021; He et al., 2019), road safety (Sager, 2019) and crime (Bondy et al., 2020). Several recent studies also show that wind direction induces an exogenous shock to local pollution concentrations and can be used as an instrumental variable for PM==== (Bondy et al., 2020; Carneiro et al., 2021; Deryugina et al., 2019).====Our results suggest that exposure to rising levels of PM==== significantly increases flight departure delays. We find that, on average, a one-standard-deviation increase in the daily PM==== concentration leads to 6.4 additional minutes in gross departure delay per flight and 4.5 additional minutes in net departure delay per flight after excluding arrival delays from previous assignments, with PM==== instrumented by wind direction. The estimated impacts on flight delays remain statistically similar when instrumenting pollution with thermal inversions. These IV estimates are robust to a wide range of variations in specifications, data, and estimation strategies.====A key identifying assumption of our IV approaches is that, after controlling for weather conditions and relevant fixed effects, changes in thermal inversions and wind direction are not related to changes in flight departure delays, except through their influences on pollution levels. This assumption could be violated because both instruments are weather phenomena, and they may be correlated with unobserved weather events that affect flight planning. To ensure robustness of our findings, we augment our main specification by adding flexible weather controls. We also analyze subsamples that exclude days with inclement weather for flight operations. It is reassuring that our results are robust to these additional analyses, thus providing strong supportive evidence of the robustness of our estimates to the presence of unobserved weather confounding factors.====We also investigate the validity of the monotonicity assumption when using wind direction as an instrument; this assumption is less of a concern for the inversion instrument because it is unlikely that the pollution-inversion relationship holds in some regions but is reversed in other regions. More specifically, we estimate alternative specifications by allowing instruments to vary with the size of wind direction bins and the number of groups of air pollution monitors (as explained below). Our results remain robust to these variations, which lends support to the monotonicity assumption for the wind direction instrument. Our IV estimates are also robust to simultaneously instrumenting for PM==== and other air pollutants, including sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, and nitrogen dioxide, suggesting that the estimated impacts of air pollution on flight delays are indeed due to PM==== and are not related to other air pollutants.====These adverse effects of pollution on flight delays are more pronounced for passengers travelling long distances and departing from large airports. The observed national average ==== (====) delay per flight increased by 4.6 (4.5) minutes in 2017 compared to that in 2015. We estimate that the reduction in PM==== concentrations attributable to clean air policies in China, avoided approximately 13–18% of the increases in national average flight delays and saved US $54 to $69 million in passenger time in 2017 alone.====Our findings have a number of implications. First, the robust negative correlation between PM==== and flight departure delays demonstrates a substantial impact of air pollution that has been neglected by current estimates of social costs of air pollution, which primarily focus on health outcomes and productivity. Second, our results suggest that improving air quality at airports presents an opportunity to reduce flight departure delays, especially for flights departing from large airports and travelling long distances on polluted days. Finally, our results further support China's ambitious clean air policies by showing that the improvement in air quality in China has led to a considerable economic benefit due to avoided flight delays.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

Between 1987–2014, the Snake River Basin adjudication determined who had legal rights to use water, covering 139,000 water rights and 90% of Idaho’s water use. Using differences in the timing of adjudication between different sub-basins, we find that adjudication caused a 140% increase in the frequency of water right trades and transfers; that these trades and transfers moved water to parcels of land more suitable for irrigated agriculture; that water-use intensity remains unchanged after adjudication; and that adjudication prompts irrigators, especially those owning surface water rights, to shift from lower-value to higher-value land uses. These changes create benefits with a present value of at least $402.7 million, outweighing the one-time fixed cost of $94 million Idaho spent on adjudication.","Water use in the Western United States is governed by the legal doctrine of “prior appropriation”. Under this doctrine, historical water use patterns give rise to ==== property rights. Specifically, if an individual has historically diverted water and put it to beneficial use, then they gain a legal right to continue diverting water for beneficial use. Although the resulting water rights exist in the form of legal entitlements, historically states have spent few resources to systematically verify or document these rights.==== Consequently, water rights are often ambiguous and costly to enforce, which can create frequent disputes, distort resource allocation and production decisions, deter investment, and act as a barrier to transferring water rights.====Historically, disputes over water rights were resolved on an ==== basis: when a problem arose, a judge would review the claims of all involved parties, often at significant expense, and determine the rights of each constituent. Over the past thirty years, it has become commonplace for states to minimize disputes by undertaking the process of ====, through which a court formally verifies which users within a watershed have valid rights and what their entitlements are. However, large-scale adjudications often take decades to complete and involve substantial litigation costs because of their scale and complexity. Initially, legal experts expected large adjudications to be completed within a few years. Yet as litigation caused the process to drag on for decades, the cost to taxpayers became increasingly steep, leading some legal scholars to question the efficacy of ==== (Tarlock, 2009, MacDonnell, 2015).====From an economic perspective, adjudication leads to more clearly defined property rights for water by improving the exclusivity, enforceability, and transferability of said rights. Enforcement of rights typically has involved time-consuming ground-truthing, conflicts between water users, and litigation, none of which is responsive to the immediate needs of irrigators during drought. The adjudication process reduces the uncertainty of water delivery by establishing and enforcing a clear hierarchy of water rights priorities within each sub-basin, thus potentially leading to improvements in resource allocation for land and water (Cobourn et al., 2021), while also stimulating investments in the production processes (Besley, 1995).====Adjudication also may reduce the transaction costs involved in the transfer of water rights, which can be substantial. Prior appropriation of water rights exists detached from the land on which the water is used. In principle, water rights could thus be transferred across different parcels of land.==== Many economists have argued that this could give rise to a flexible market for water rights and more efficient ==== allocation of water (e.g. Burness and Quirk, 1979, Burness and Quirk, 1980, Anderson and Libecap, 2014). However, the development of ==== has been hampered across the Western United States by the lack of institutional support (Olmstead, 2010, Leonard et al., 2019). Before adjudication, sellers must prove to the State that they have a legitimate claim. This is costly because it requires systematically documenting historical use and puts sellers at the risk of losing their right if the State fails to endorse it. Sellers are also typically required to show that proposed trades and transfers of water rights have no adverse impacts on third parties, which can be challenging when potential third parties cannot be identified easily in the absence of formal documentation.==== These are examples of what Coase (1960) would describe as “transaction costs”, and general basin adjudication is a policy that we might expect would reduce these transaction costs.====The benefits of adjudication might also be shared differently among different users based on the water source, such as surface water and groundwater. For example, surface water users usually face significantly more seasonal variability than groundwater users. Furthermore, surface water users can monitor more easily and exclude others from exploiting their resource through existing infrastructure. In contrast, new groundwater wells can be easily established anywhere above an aquifer; thus, these wells are harder to monitor. Adjudication also enables state agencies to manage surface water and groundwater conjunctively.==== Under conjunctive management, groundwater users may have their water use mitigated on an ongoing basis because surface water rights are generally established earlier in time. This represents a net transfer of water from groundwater to surface water users post-adjudication.====To date, little research has attempted to quantify the impact of a large-scale adjudication, a gap in the literature that we aim to fill.==== In this study, we seek to understand whether the economic benefits of adjudication outweigh the substantial initial costs incurred during the adjudication process, and if so, what the channels are through which those benefits arise and whether there are differential impacts among different groups of water users, such as surface vs. groundwater users. We study these questions in the setting of the adjudication of the Snake River Basin in Idaho. Between 1987 and 2014, Idaho built a large bureaucracy to undertake the largest water right adjudication completed to date in the Western United States.==== The adjudication covered 87 percent of Idaho’s land area and 90% of its water use for some 139,000 individual water rights, corresponding to the court settling approximately one case every 90 min for 24 years.==== Put another way, the adjudication settled one court case for every ten people in Idaho. During this process, water courts clarified individual property rights, reformed water law, and streamlined the institutions that managed and approved water right transfers within the State. The adjudication process also allowed state agencies to modernize their water rights management and enforcement using computerized hydrologic models, remote-sensing-based water usage monitoring, and conjunctive management of groundwater and surface-water rights.====We identify the medium-run impacts of adjudication using panel variation in the quasi-random timing of adjudication between sub-basins. Fig. 1 illustrates a map for each sub-basin in Idaho that formed the basic unit for the adjudication process. Histories of Idaho’s adjudication indicate that the Snake River Basin was divided into 35 sub-basins, and the adjudication took place on a sequential sub-basin by sub-basin basis. The timing of adjudication is determined by the limited legal and administrative capacity by the court system and Idaho’s Department of Water Resources (Vonde et al., 2016) and thus is plausibly unrelated to economic outcomes of our interest.==== Furthermore, because every sub-basin within the Snake River Basin eventually becomes adjudicated, there is no selection into adjudication, which might bias our estimates.==== Under such a setting, we propose to identify the benefits from adjudication in a difference-in-differences (DID) framework under a parallel trends assumption that the trends in adjudication between adjudicated and not-yet adjudicated basins would be the same but for adjudication. We apply standard panel data regression techniques with individual and year fixed effects (two-way fixed effects, or TWFE), which assumes that treatment effects are homogeneous across time. We also test the robustness of our modeling specification by estimating the doubly robust Difference-in-Differences (DRDID) estimator proposed by Callaway and Sant’Anna (2020), which allows treatment effects to vary over time.====The empirical analysis is presented in a number of parts. First, we test for reduced-form evidence that adjudication leads to an increase in the rate at which water rights are traded or transferred. After adjudication, we find a 140% increase in the rate at which water rights are traded or transferred. This increase is robust to a variety of specifications. After adjudication, trades and transfers of both groundwater and surface water rights increase at a similar rate, indicating broad benefits from reduced transaction costs.====Second, we use remotely sensed data to examine whether paper transfers of water rights led to real changes in agricultural production decisions and whether these changes differ between user groups. We find that on average, water rights transfers move water to parcels of land more suitable for irrigated agriculture.==== However, based on measured evapotranspiration, we do not find meaningful changes in water intensity after adjudication; instead, the predominant margin of change after adjudication is in terms of land use decisions. This is consistent with our hypothesis that adjudication increased the efficiency of water use without changing the degree of exploitation of water resources. Specifically, we find that after adjudication, irrigators substitute from lower-value pastureland into higher-value croplands, resulting in a 2.7% increase in expected net revenue on average. A similar pattern occurs when a farmer buys a water right, resulting in a 3.5% increase in expected net revenue. Taken together, adjudication creates annual economic benefits of $20.1 million per year; when discounted in perpetuity at a 5% rate, these economic benefits have a present value of $402.7 million. At least 15% of these benefits can be explained by the increase in the rate of water right transfers induced by adjudication, which is suggestive of realized gains from trade (this amounts to $2.8 million in annual benefits or a present value of $56 million). The economic benefits, as measured by planting more profitable land uses, mostly accrue to surface water users. Surface water users increase their cropland acreage by 4.3 percentage points after adjudication, whereas groundwater users only increase cropland acreage by a statistically insignificant 0.3 percentage point.====This paper adds to three distinct areas of the scholarly literature. First, we contribute to the understanding of the economic impact of variations in property rights. There is growing empirical literature that examines quasi-random variation in property rights generated from sources such as political reform (Alston et al., 2000, Libecap and Lueck, 2011, Galiani and Schargrodsky, 2010), political connectedness (Goldstein and Udry, 2008), or technological change (Hornbeck, 2010). This paper adds to the literature by measuring how institutional changes reduce transaction costs, as theoretically motivated by Coase (1960) and Demsetz (1967); and how that leads to measurable efficiency gains. Recent authors have observed that this is still an understudied area of the environmental literature (Wang, 2007, Libecap, 2016, Leonard et al., 2019).====Second, we add to the literature on understanding the economic performance of prior appropriation water rights and water markets in the Western United States and worldwide, especially where water is ==== (Olmstead, 2010, Leonard et al., 2019). A few recent papers have studied the economic implications of prior appropriation water rights in the Western United States (Brent, 2016, Lee et al., 2020, Cobourn et al., 2021) and alternatives to the prior appropriation system, such as collective allocation institutions (Ji and Cobourn, 2018, Smith, 2021). Another strand of the empirical literature looks at the economic performance of water markets, specifically in the context of the Rio Grande (Debaere and Li, 2020), California’s groundwater (Ayres et al., 2018, Ayres et al., 2021), a historical Spanish water market (Donna and Espín-Sánchez, 2018), and the Murray–Darling Basin Rafey (2020). Our study bridges the two strands of literature by documenting the efficiency gains through clearly defining property rights for water within the existing institution of prior appropriation. As noted in Leonard et al. (2019), institutional advancements such as ==== adjudication reduce transaction costs and increase the efficiency gains from trade, which is exactly what we find here.====Third, this paper also adds to the literature on the economic value of water. A number of studies value irrigation water using the hedonic method, for example Mukherjee and Schwabe (2014) and Buck et al. (2014) in California, Faux and Perry (1999) in Oregon, Petrie and Taylor (2007) in Georgia, and Brent (2016) in Washington State. Our study adds to this literature by quantifying the monetary value of water in the context of the semi-arid U.S. West.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives further background on prior appropriation water rights and the Snake River Basin adjudication. Sections 3 Data, 4 Identification, respectively, describe the data and identification strategy; Section 5 demonstrates that adjudication increases the frequency of water right trading; and Section 6 demonstrates that adjudication results in measurable economic benefits; Section 7 concludes.",The Economic Value of Clarifying Property Rights: Evidence from Water in Idaho’s Snake River Basin,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069623000177,3 March 2023,2023,Research Article,20.0

We assess the regional and sectoral responses in agriculture to rising temperatures using a rich and comprehensive panel of Chinese counties over more than two decades. We leverage temperature variations both from year to year and over multiple-year periods to separately identify short-run and intermediate-run responses. We find that temperature effects vary between northern and southern China, and between sectors (cropping, livestock, forestry, and fisheries). Warming's impacts are concentrated in the cooler northern region, where contemporaneous high temperatures depress both the cropping and livestock sectors but benefit the forestry sector. When intermediate-run adaptations are accounted for, the negative short-run impact of extreme temperatures on the cropping sector can be largely mitigated. But the mitigating effect is limited in the livestock sector. These findings inform the design and ranking of region and sector-specific policies and investments for agricultural adaptation to climate change.","Climate change, one of the most pressing environmental challenges of our time, poses severe threats to global agricultural systems (Calzadilla et al., 2013; Shukla et al., 2019). Unfavorable climatic conditions can hinder the agricultural production that supplies food, fuel, clothing, and shelter to humans (Kirilenko and Sedjo, 2007; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2010; Wheeler and Von Braun, 2013). These threats become more significant as global demand for agricultural products increases and diversifies with rising income and rapid urbanization (Tilman et al., 2011; Keating et al., 2014). The sustainability of future economic growth will crucially depend on the resilience and responsiveness of agriculture as the climate warms (Howden et al., 2007). Importantly, the different regions and sectors of the agricultural system vary in their sensitivity and adaptability to global warming. An understanding of these variations is needed to inform the development and prioritization of cost-effective adaptation strategies, especially in developing countries with resource and capability constraints.====This study focuses on China, the world's largest agricultural economy. China is the largest importer and the sixth largest exporter of agricultural products on the globe. In 2019, the total value of its agricultural output exceeded a trillion US dollars, and the total traded value of agricultural products (imports and exports combined) amounted to 230 billion US dollars (MOA, 2019; FAO, 2020). Over the past 70 years, China's annual mean land surface temperature has increased by an average of 0.26 °C/decade, substantially exceeding the global average of 0.15 °C/decade (CMA, 2021). The impact of rising temperatures on Chinese agriculture, and its ability to adapt to them, matter both for the country's vast domestic population and market, and for billions of people around the world.====In this paper, we provide a holistic empirical evaluation of regional and sectoral sensitivities and adaptabilities of Chinese agriculture to rising temperatures, based on a rich and comprehensive panel dataset drawn from approximately 2500 counties over more than 20 years. In a panel fixed effect framework, we exploit within-county year-to-year variations in local land surface air temperature distribution to identify short-run temperature impacts on regional and sectoral specific agricultural output values, controlling for other weather variables and nonlinear regional trends. Guided by a conceptual model, we illustrate that the empirical estimates not only reflect physical impacts of temperature on agricultural products, but also carry information, though to a lesser extent, regarding direct and indirect price effects incurred by temperature deviations.====We find that temperature impacts on agriculture are in general more salient in northern China. An additional 24-h with temperatures above 35 °C would lower the aggregate output value of northern agriculture by about 4.95%, relative to the reference temperature range of 10–15 °C. This reduction is mostly driven by induced value losses in the cropping and livestock sectors. Unlike in northern China, we do not find significant impacts of temperature on agricultural output values in southern China. These regional and sectoral heterogeneities are particularly meaningful since we would find generally insignificant temperature effects had we aggregated all the regions and sectors for our empirical examination.====We support the value-based sectoral and regional estimates with empirical estimates on the major products in each sector and each region, considering that direct physical impacts still constitute the primary channel through which temperature affects the aggregate output value. To this end, we assess the yield responses of six major crops in the cropping sector, including corn, wheat, rice, vegetables, soybeans, and oil crops. In the other three sectors, we examine the impacts of rising temperatures on the total production of individual products. Major products in the livestock sector include meat, milk, and eggs. In the forestry sector, we analyze several primary and processed timber products (raw logs, sawn logs, chipboard and plywood) and non-timber forest products. Our analysis of the fishery sector considers aquatic products in both freshwater and seawater. In all the four sectors in both northern and southern China, our product-level estimates in general support the value-based results, despite heterogeneities across different products.====Building on our estimated contemporaneous effects, we further explore value responses in the intermediate run, considering that (i) heat impacts may accumulate over years for certain agricultural products, and (ii) meaningful adaptive actions may be induced upon experiencing shocks. Here we rely on three different estimation strategies, including a moving-average specification, a distributed-lag model and a long-difference approach. Building on the empirical estimates obtained from the first two approaches, the contrasts between our short-run and intermediate-run sectoral estimates are contextualized with a set of projection simulations based on hypothetical uniform warming of 0.5 °C, 1.0 °C, 1.5 °C, and 2.0 °C, respectively. The results indicate that, although the cropping and livestock sectors in northern China are similarly affected by high temperatures in the short run, the cropping sector is much more resilient in the intermediate run than the livestock sector. The projection simulation based on the long-difference estimates further supports that intermediate-run adaptations can fully mitigate the short-run negative impact in the cropping sector, but the mitigating effect is much more limited in the livestock sector.====This paper contributes to the literature on understanding climatic impacts on agriculture. Previous research has extensively examined the implications of rising temperatures for the cropping sector.==== However, empirical analysis of other sectors, such as livestock, forestry, and fisheries, remains scant (Carter et al., 2018), despite them jointly contributing nearly 40% of global agricultural output by value (The World Bank, 2020). Overlooking warming's implications for these sectors would preclude a general view of the agricultural system's likely evolution as climates change. Our analysis not only fills this gap by providing estimates on the livestock, forestry, and fishery sectors in addition to the cropping sector. Moreover, with a unifying framework, our sectoral estimates will allow decision makers to comprehend the relative responsiveness of agricultural sectors to rising temperatures, and to prioritize adaptive efforts and investments. It is also worth mentioning that, without our effort on collecting a comprehensive dataset on the world's largest agricultural economy, this holistic evaluation would not be feasible.====The estimation strategy we adopt in this paper takes advantages of both the Ricardian approach and the panel approach for identifying climatic impacts. Using agricultural output value as the outcome variable enables us to incorporate both direct physical impacts (supply-side) and indirect price effects (demand-side) of temperature on agriculture. It has a conceptual similarity with the existing hedonic studies (Mendelsohn et al., 1994; Deschênes and Greenstone, 2007), while focusing on output values as the variable of interest has excused us from confounding effects arising from induced input adjustments.====Our empirical analysis on the intermediate-run response also builds on the emerging literature on identifying agricultural adaptation to climate change. Our work falls into the group that requires estimates to implicitly account for adaptation.==== Based on yield measures, Burke and Emerick (2016) devise the “long-difference” approach and find minimal long-run adaptation of US corn and soybean productivity to rising temperatures. Mérel and Gammans (2021) propose a novel estimation strategy to obtain estimates that reflect both short-run response and long-run adaptability.==== In contrast to Burke and Emerick (2016), the empirical illustration in Mérel and Gammans (2021) suggests that meaningful yield adaptation exists for certain crops in the US and France. Our results on sectoral adaptability, in the context of China, echoes these findings as we also find intermediate-run adaptability in the cropping sector. However, our findings suggest that cropping's adaptability to warming cannot be directly generalized to other agricultural sectors.====Our key results have important policy implications. In particular, the weaker adaptability in the livestock sector implies that immediate actions should be taken to mitigate the persistent negative impact of warming on this sector. Beyond this sectoral heterogeneity, the north-south regional differentiation in our results is informative for those making concrete adaptation plans for geographically vast countries like China, especially since previous empirical studies have focused exclusively on average temperature effects across the entire country (Chen et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2017; Chen and Gong, 2021).====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides necessary background on China's climate and agriculture. Section 3 presents a conceptual model that illustrates the contents of information carried by the empirical estimates. Section 4 introduces our novel and comprehensive datasets. Section 5 discusses estimation of temperature effects on sectoral values, with supporting evidence based on the product-level estimates.

In this work, I use quasi-random US county detections of the invasive emerald ash borer (EAB), a forest-attacking pest, to investigate how invasive-induced deforestation can impact obesity rates and time spent on physical activity. Results suggest that EAB is associated with 1–4 percentage points (pp) (mean = 37.0%) annual losses of deciduous forest cover in infested counties. After EAB detection, obesity rates are higher by 2.5pp (mean = 24.7%) and daily minutes spent on physical activity are lower by 4.9 minutes (mean = 51.7 min), on average. I show that less time spent on outdoor sports and exercise is one possible, but not exclusive, mechanism.

Results are supported by many robustness and falsification tests and an alternative IV specification. This work has policy implications for invasive species management and expands our understanding of invasive species impacts on additional economic outcomes of interest.","Globally, the continued spread of invasive species is disrupting environmental quality and flows of ecosystem services provided by the natural environment. Invasive species have been shown to diminish water and air quality and agricultural productivity and can lead to deforestation and altered time use patterns (Sikorska et al., 2019; Jones and McDermott, 2018; Paini et al., 2016; Walsh et al., 2016). Human mortality and morbidity impacts of invasives have also been documented, particularly in instances where environmental quality is severely disrupted (e.g., Jones, 2019a; Mazza et al., 2014; Juliano and Philip Lounibos, 2005). Similarly, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) warns that invasive species are a “threat to human well-being” because they fundamentally alter the “make-up and the character of the biological world” (UNEP, 2016).====Despite such statements, our understanding of empirical, specific links between invasive species and individual human well-being outcomes is in fact quite limited. Few causal inference studies exist that employ experimental or quasi-experimental identification strategies.==== Much of the extant literature on invasive species impacts to human outcomes is correlational, which makes it challenging, from a causal inference point-of-view, for us to understand the true economic burden of invasive species on society. Furthermore, the extant literature has primarily focused on the mortality and morbidity impacts of invasive species spread (e.g., premature death, infant health, disease burdens) or on economic damages to silviculture, agriculture, and fisheries. While such work is important, it also means that invasive species impacts to other important, yet rarely studied health-related outcomes, such as body mass and physical activity habits are poorly documented and understood, leaving a knowledge gap that needs to be filled. The absence of a holistic understanding of invasive species impacts means that benefit-cost analyses of invasive species management and control are likely to be incomplete and biased, potentially leading to inefficient policy outcomes.====In this work, I expand our understanding of the connections between invasive species and human well-being by exploiting a natural experiment to study invasives’ impacts to several human health-related biological and lifestyle indicators. Specifically, I leverage US county-level detections of the invasive emerald ash borer (EAB), a forest-attacking pest, as a source of exogenous variation in forest cover, and, hence, a source of variation in environmental quality, to study changes in individual-level body mass, obesity prevalence, and time spent on physical activity. Economists are particularly interested in the determinants of obesity since medical and healthcare expenditures are often higher among obese individuals due to increased rates of heart disease and diabetes (Kuroki, 2020). Additionally, obesity may lead to reductions in worker productivity and wages and can increase labor market absenteeism (Brown and Routon, 2017). Similarly, I investigate the link between invasive species and time spent on physical activity because of the well-known positive impacts that physical activity can have on chronic diseases, stress and depression, and emotional well-being (Humphreys et al., 2014; Sherwood and Jeffery, 2000). Physical activity may also influence obesity rates (Ross et al., 2016).====I use the universe of county-level EAB detections in the US between 2002 and 2012 from the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service combined with individual-level body mass, obesity, and physical activity data from the US CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). The BRFSS is considered to be the premier system of health-related telephone surveys in the US, collecting more than 400,000 adult interviews per year on various health-related behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services (US CDC, 2014). I employ a flexible difference-in-differences strategy to investigate the obesity and physical activity effects of EAB detection. A multitude of fixed effects and controls for socioeconomic and demographic confounders are used in order to isolate the EAB effect. I also estimate a suggestive first-stage model showing EAB's impact to county-level deciduous forest cover, in order to preliminarily investigate the suspected mechanism by which EAB spread may translate into biological effects on obesity and physical activity.====The causal interpretation of my findings is supported by several checks, including: (i) an event study plot showing increasing marginal impacts of EAB over time, consistent with the biologically delayed timing of EAB-induced deforestation; (ii) falsification tests showing no impact of EAB on being underweight, no impact of EAB in the years prior to actual detection, and no impact of EAB on non-ash coniferous forest canopy; (iii) a robustness check that accounts for spatial autocorrelation in EAB detection using a Spatial Durbin Model; (iv) an investigation of biological mechanisms using daily time use diary data from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS); (v) results showing that changes in economic activity are likely not driving my findings, and; (vi) an IV specification that uses EAB detections as an instrument for deciduous forest cover to validate a suspected deforestation pathway of effect.====My main results indicate that obesity prevalence is higher by 2.5 percentage points (mean = 24.7%) and minutes spent on physical activity are lower by 4.9 minutes per average day (mean = 51.7 min) in the years after detection for individuals living in EAB counties. While the obesity result is likely influenced by changes in physical activity (a caloric expenditure story), it is unlikely to be the only salient mechanism, and the magnitude of the physical activity effect is likely too low to fully explain the obesity result. As discussed later, prior work has found EAB impacts on other time use habits (e.g., the labor-leisure tradeoff) (Jones, 2016), on air pollution levels (Tan, 2022), and on subjective well-being (Jones, 2017), each of which may contribute to changes in obesity. Using prior estimates of the medical costs associated with obesity, I calculate that EAB is associated with $3.0 billion in annual obesity-related healthcare costs in the US over 2002–2012. This is equivalent to approximately 1.2% of total annual medical costs associated with obesity in the US.====This work contributes to the literature on the economics of invasive species (e.g., Jones, 2019a; Jardine and Sanchirico, 2018; Epanchin-Niell, 2017; Connelly et al., 2007) by broadening our understanding of invasives’ true indirect costs to society. Additionally, I contribute to the literature on the environmental determinants of obesity and physical activity (e.g., Sallis et al., 2012; Björk et al., 2008), including work by economists (e.g., Katare and Beatty, 2018), by showing, for the first time, to the best of my knowledge, that invasive species spread can affect these outcomes of interest. Finally, this work adds to the broader economics literature on environmental health and well-being because it provides new evidence on how deforestation (caused by an invasive species) can negatively influence health-related outcomes (e.g., Garg, 2019; Berazneva and Byker, 2017). In particular, I add to this literature by evaluating biological and lifestyle outcomes that are less commonly studied in the context of environmental health.",Can invasive species lead to sedentary behavior?

This is reflected in higher probabilities of default, lower z-scores, higher non-performing assets ratios, higher foreclosure ratios, lower returns on assets and lower equity ratios of affected banks in the years following a natural disaster. The effects are economically relevant and highlight the financial vulnerability of banks and their borrowers despite insurances and public aid programs.","Natural disasters such as the February 2021 North American winter storm have the potential to devastate entire regions and to cause loss of life and property. They have become even more frequent and destructive over the last decades, as shown by empirical data (Leaning and Guha-Sapir, 2013, United Nations, 2015). Policymakers worldwide worry that this may also have adverse effects on financial stability and have thus started initiatives to analyze and mitigate consequences for the financial sector (e.g., Bank of England, 2015, IMF, 2019).====This study explores whether weather-related disasters affect the financial stability of banks.==== Whether this is the case or not is not obvious. On the one hand, banks are affected because disaster-related damage immediately reduce banks’ collateral values and the credit standings of their borrowers. Further, disaster-related damage may cause business disruptions and adversely affect economic growth in the banks’ business regions. On the other hand, insurance payments, as well as public financial aid programs, support corporations and individuals in affected regions, and thereby mitigate the shock.==== Finally, reconstruction activities in the aftermath of natural disasters may even boost economic growth.====The main contribution of our study is to present new and comprehensive evidence on the effects of weather-related disasters on bank stability for the U.S. financial system. The existing literature provides mixed results about whether natural disasters affect the economy and banks in developed countries. For example, Strobl (2011) investigates the effect of damage from hurricanes in the U.S. Gulf Coast region and finds a considerable decrease in economic growth rates in affected regions, while Cavallo et al. (2013) find no significant effect of natural disasters on economic growth for a sample of 196 countries worldwide. Klomp (2014) finds that large-scale natural disasters negatively affect the stability of the banking sector in emerging countries, but not in developed countries. Blickle et al. (2022) find that disasters declared by the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency had insignificant or small effects on U.S. bank performance.====Based on a large sample of more than 12,000 reported instances of damage, county-level rainfall data, and about 5700 banks over more than 20 years, our analysis provides new evidence that weather-related disaster damage in the banks’ business regions indeed weakens credit quality, bank stability and profitability. This is reflected in significantly higher non-performing assets ratios, higher foreclosure ratios, higher probabilities of default, lower z-scores, lower returns on assets and lower equity ratios in the two years following a natural disaster. The evidence reveals that natural disasters jeopardize borrowers’ financial solvency and decrease bank stability, despite potential insurance payments and public aid programs. On a more positive note, we find that effects are economically significant but not huge when compared with the deterioration of the credit quality, stability and profitability of banks during the Global Financial Crisis that began in 2008.====Overall, our analysis contributes to the growing literature on the economic consequences of natural disasters. Related papers use natural disasters as a shock on mortgage risk, banks’ asset quality or local credit demand and explore its consequences for bank lending (e.g., Garmaise and Moskowitz, 2009, Berg and Schrader, 2012, Cortes and Strahan, 2017, Schüwer et al., 2019, Koetter et al., 2020, Garbarino and Guin, 2021, Blickle et al., 2022). Brei et al. (2019) show for hurricane strikes in the Caribbean that banks are mainly affected through deposit withdrawals, and not through loan defaults. Bos et al. (2022) study banks’ allocation of loans and securities during natural disaster periods. Ozsoy et al. (2020) find that drought shocks lead to lower financial stability, lower loan performance and more bank closures for a sample of publicly traded banks. Gropp et al. (2019) show that banks with higher disaster risks in their home regions expand more across states than banks that do not face such risks. For an analysis of catastrophic risk and the insurance market, see, e.g., Froot (2001) and Kousky et al., 2018, Kousky et al., 2020. Islam and Nguyen (2018) examine informal risk-sharing among households after a natural disaster.

The evidence implies that naive estimations of the adverse effect of air pollution on health are biased, as people sort on air quality differently depending on their health. I employ a spatial-equilibrium model in which households choose a county to live in based on county-level characteristics including air pollution. Using National Longitudinal Survey of Youth data, I create a panel tracking respondents’ respiratory health shocks and county-level location for over three decades. The estimates from a multinomial mixed logit model support the hypothesis that households move to cleaner-air locations after an adult is diagnosed with asthma. I find that households react more strongly to an asthma diagnosis for an adult than to a child’s diagnosis. The estimated median increase in marginal willingness to pay for a one-unit reduction in Air Quality Index after a diagnosis of adult-onset asthma is $157–$830 (in constant 1982–84 dollars).","The adverse effect of air pollution on health is an important public policy issue and plays a dominant role in benefit-cost analyses of air-pollution regulations. Much of the epidemiology driving the regulations is based on cross-sectional variation in health and pollution. These estimates have the advantage of estimating long-run effects. However, if the population vulnerable to polluted air tends to avert health risk by choosing to live in places with better air quality, cross-sectional estimates that do not consider selection based on health and air quality could be biased downward. For example, if the more pollution-sensitive population avoids a county with worse air quality, by comparing the average health of the population in this county to that in a cleaner county we are comparing two different populations. The adverse effect would be larger if the selection effect could be controlled.====This paper examines the extent of such sorting by exploring the impact of health on households’ location choice. Recent work provides evidence showing that air-quality-related health conditions could lead to migration through different pathways. Decker and Schmitz (2016) show that experiencing a health shock increases individual risk aversion for at least four years following the shock; it is reasonable to assume that the increased risk aversion might nudge people to take actions such as moving away from places with dirty air. Empirical tests of Tiebout sorting suggest that people do respond to air pollution (Banzhaf and Walsh, 2008). Given these results, we can expect populations with air-quality-related diseases to have a strong incentive to vote with their feet.====To test whether people actually sort themselves into different areas this way, I take advantage of health shocks and examine whether the effect of air quality on households’ location choice depends on the relevant health condition. The panel nature of my data allows me to leverage the effect of changes in health status conditional on unobserved heterogeneity in tastes. These health shocks include first-time diagnosis of asthma and other respiratory diseases among adults and children. I employ a spatial-equilibrium model in which households decide which US county to live in based on the air quality, housing expenditure, and per capita medical resources in each county as well as unobserved location-specific mean utility.====Empirically, I start from a discrete-choice model setup similar to Bayer et al.’s (2009) but with microlevel data on location choices matched to health status of family members. These panel data allow me to control for unobserved tastes in locational preferences using a mixed multinomial logit model. The panel data set tracks respondents’ health conditions and county-level locations for over three decades using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (specifically, NLSY79, NLSY79 Children and Young Adults, and NLSY Geocode data). I merge the individual-level data with county information on the Air Quality Index (AQI) from the Environmental Protection Agency, housing price from the House Price Index of Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), and per capita hospital-bed count from the NLSY Geocode data.====My results support the hypothesis that households with certain health conditions – specifically, adult-onset asthma – are more likely to move to locations with cleaner air. I find that households react more strongly to a new asthma diagnosis for an adult than a child. For illustration, the probability that a household with at least one adult diagnosed with asthma will choose to live in a place such as Los Angeles County would decrease by 0.4% as a result of a ten-point increase in AQI (worsened air quality) in the county. I estimate that a median household’s marginal willingness to pay for a one-unit reduction in the index after a diagnosis of adult-onset asthma is $157–$830 (in constant 1982–84 dollars) higher than a household without adult-onset asthma. These findings suggest that analysis of air quality’s effect on health needs to account for sorting triggered by health conditions. I also find that households with a pregnant member avoid counties with high AQI.====This paper contributes to the literature in the following ways. First, it contributes to the migration literature by giving an answer to the question of why people move. Although several studies have provided evidence that residents sort based on exogenous changes in air quality using natural experiments, such as Banzhaf and Walsh (2008), or using instrumental variables, such as Freeman et al. (2019), it is not clear how health affects such locational decisions in a more general setting. Second, insofar as this migration is a particular kind of averting behavior intended to minimize the health impact of pollution, the paper contributes to the broader literature on averting behavior. For example, some works, such as Moretti and Neidell (2011), document that people are willing to invest in defensive measures against air pollution to avoid health risk. Third, it relates to the literature on health perception and behavioral adjustment to changes in health. Smith et al. (2001) were among the first to show that health shocks provide new information and change people’s perception of their health by comparing data on smokers and nonsmokers. Carbone et al. (2006) and Smith et al. (2006) explore Florida residents’ migration pattern as a behavioral response to environmental risks, such as hurricane damage. This paper contributes to this literature by generating new knowledge on location-choice responses to air-quality-related health conditions.====This paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, I introduce the related literature that motivates this paper. In Section 3, I introduce the theoretical model and my empirical strategy. Section 4 presents summary statistics. In Section 5, I show and discuss the results.

In particular, some countries have started to promote investment in low carbon “clean” sectors under the heading of sustainable finance. The idea is to steer capital flows in favor of “green” firms that do not use carbon intensively and to reduce investment in „dirty”, carbon-intensive production. For example, the Norwegian oil fund already excludes investment in carbon-intensive industries (Norges Bank Investment Management, 2020). The European Union has developed a taxonomy for sustainable finance which employs carbon-intensity of firms as a key criterion. However, using financial regulation to promote decarbonisation also meets resistance. For instance, in the US, the oil producing state of Texas recently introduced a new law prohibiting the state's retirement and investment funds from doing business with financial companies which promote green standards and, according to the state of Texas, refuse to finance oil companies. Lawmakers in 15 other states are promoting similar legislation.====The polarized debate about the introduction of sustainable finance as an instrument to promote climate protection raises two questions. First, how does sustainable finance affect the efficiency of climate policy? Second, what forces could drive the use of this policy instrument?====In this paper we argue that the use of sustainable finance as a climate policy tool as well as the polarization related to this instrument may be explained by the interaction of irreversibility of physical investment with political economy problems, related to the fact that current governments would like to bind the policies of future governments but cannot easily do so. We develop the idea that sustainable finance regulations, which facilitate investment in green sectors, exhibit more commitment power than political announcements of future environmental policies. Although many countries have specified an intended path for carbon reduction in the Kyoto process, this announcement is generally not perceived as legally binding. In particular, changes in government can yield a revision of environmental policies. One example is the withdrawal from the Paris agreement by the Trump administration. This highlights the importance of commitment devices. The wish of policymakers to bind future governments to their green policies is also reflected in many political announcements. For instance, in a recent speech, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated the goal „to make the transition to climate neutrality irreversible.“====We develop our analysis using a model of an open economy with a clean and a dirty sector. There are two political parties we call ‘green’ and ‘conservative’, which differ regarding their preferences for reducing emissions. The green party prefers lower emissions than the conservative party. Economic decisions are taken in two periods. In the first period, firms make irreversible investment decisions and the government may or may not use sustainable finance to steer the capital allocation between the two sectors. For simplicity, sustainable finance is modelled as a subsidy to capital used in the clean sector. There are elections at the end of period 1, after the incumbent government has made its policy decisions and after investment decisions. As a result of these elections, the party in government changes with a given probability. In the second period, the new government determines a quantity of tradeable carbon emissions certificates and, hence, the level of emissions generated by the dirty sector.====If commitment is possible, the government in period 1 can set not just the capital subsidy but also a binding emissions cap in period 2, which cannot be changed by the next government. In this setting==== neither a green nor a conservative government would use the sustainable finance instrument in period 1. The reason is that the emissions cap is enough to implement the desired climate policy at minimal costs. Adding the sustainable finance subsidy reduces economic efficiency, irrespective of the intensity of preferences for carbon reduction.====However, if commitment is not possible because a new government will choose the emissions price according to its preferences, the situation changes. In this case, a green government will implement a sustainable finance subsidy in period 1 favouring the clean sector. A larger capital stock in the clean sector and a smaller one in the dirty sector leads to more restrictive environmental policies in period 2, irrespective of which party wins the next elections. However, a green government benefits in particular from the stricter environmental policy it can induce if the next government is conservative. The reason is as follows. The sustainable finance policy reduces the size of the capital stock and, hence, employment in the dirty sector. Therefore, in period 2, the cost in the form of economic output lost of a more restrictive emissions cap is reduced as well. This implies that the green government can reduce the cost of stricter environmental policy in period 2 through sustainable finance policies in period 1. The lower cost will lead the next government to choose a more restrictive emissions cap, whatever the ruling party. Likewise, a conservative government ruling in period 1 would even choose to tax the green sector if it can, i.e. it will effectively subsidize the dirty sector because this will induce a possible green government in the next period to pursue a laxer climate policy, simply because the cost of reducing emissions in terms of output lost is now higher. Against this backdrop, sustainable finance can be seen as a climate policy commitment device for governments with green preferences, albeit a costly one.====Our model offers a possible explanation not only for the use of sustainable finance instruments (or the opposite) but also for the observed political polarization regarding climate policy. Interestingly, in this model, if conservative governments are in office in both periods, their climate policy will end up being laxer than the policy the conservative party itself prefers, i.e. laxer than the policy it would choose if it was certain it will be in power in both periods. Along the same lines, the policy of two subsequent green governments is ‘greener’ than what the green party itself would choose if it did not face the risk of losing power. The polarization is the more extreme, the higher the degree of political instability, i.e. the lower the likelihood of reelection of the incumbent government in period 1.====This paper builds on the idea that politicians who face reelection uncertainty may pursue policies that would be suboptimal in a first best environment to bind future governments – a concept which has gained prominence in the area of fiscal policy, in particular when discussing the strategic use of public debt. For instance, Alesina and Tabellini (1990) show that parties with a preference for low levels of public goods provision may cut taxes and incur high levels of debt to limit the fiscal space of future governments, so that future spending on public goods provision is lower.====Our paper is also related to several strands of the literature explaining or justifying the use of sustainable finance. Many papers on sustainable finance focus on descriptive and empirical aspects, dealing with motives of investors to hold green funds, their relative performance, and their attempts to integrate environmental criteria into corporate goals (Friede et al., 2015; Riedl and Smeets, 2017; Dyck et al., 2019). Several contributions analyze taxes on carbon and carbon-intensive capital in a growth context. Acemoglu et al. (2012) argue that taxing carbon at a moderate pace can be useful for sustainable growth by redirecting R&D toward clean technologies. At the same time, they emphasize that excessive taxation of the exhaustible resource (carbon) will be detrimental for growth in the long run. Analyzing a two-sector growth model, Jin et al. (2020) show that using carbon-intensive capital may help to accumulate clean capital for an extended period. Rozenberg et al. (2020) stress that subsidies to clean capital or innovation may be the preferred mode in the political process when high carbon taxes cannot be implemented in view of stranded assets that may occur. Our positive approach explains the emergence of such policies even if politicians face no upper constraints to carbon pricing.====As a key argument in favor of sustainable finance, Hong et al. (2021) claim that reducing the capital cost of sustainable firms by a subsidy enables them to engage in mitigation spending (which identifies the sustainable firms), where the benefit of mitigation accrues to the economy as a whole. By contrast, our contribution considers different goods rather than differences in technologies. It focuses on short-term and medium-term effects working through factor mobility within and across countries and adapting patterns of international trade, arriving at a more skeptical view on sustainable finance policies. Further, our paper is related to papers dealing with multiple instruments of environmental policy (Fischer and Newell, 2008; Fischer et al., 2018), justifying their joint use in order to overcome multiple market imperfections. The difference is that in Fischer and Newell (2008) knowledge spillovers play a key role, and Fischer et al. (2018) focus on technology policy and learning by doing effects. Finally, the climate change policy literature also stresses time inconsistency problems (Kydland and Prescott 1977), recommending delegating future policies to a carbon agency (Helm et al., 2003; Brunner et al., 2011) or granting subsidies to R&D to spur investment in clean technologies (Golombek et al., 2010; Ulph and Ulph, 2013).====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the model, Section 3 presents the analysis of the interplay between sustainable finance and environmental policy when commitment to future environmental policy measures is feasible. Section 4 considers the same issues in a setting without commitment to future environmental policies.

First, we look at whether inventive activities in environmentally-friendly domains depend on patenting in related technological domains that are not green. Based on ==== data filed over the 1978–2014 period, we estimate a spatial ","Over the past decades, the policy and scientific communities have acknowledged that the achievement of long-term climate objectives is contingent upon the ability of environmental policy to trigger technology improvements (Hoffert et al., 2002, Popp, 2002). In the policy arena, the deployment of environmental innovations is put to the fore in the action plan foreseen by the European Green Deal (COM(2019) 640 final) (European Commission, 2019) and in various policy packages such as the European Emissions Trading Scheme (Directive 2003/87/EC) and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Public Law 111–5). By providing the economic incentives to internalise the social cost of environmental degradation, regulatory stringency spurs technological advances aimed, for instance, at: tackling greenhouse gas emissions, improving the efficient use of natural resources, minimising resource depletion, etc. (Jaffe et al., 2003). Whereas stringent policies induce technological efforts in the green technological domain (see, among others, Popp, 2002, Johnstone et al., 2010b, Nesta et al., 2014),==== they further accelerate technological change by contextually decreasing the incentives to develop carbon-intensive technologies (Gray and Shadbegian, 1998).====In this context, exploring the nature of technological change is pivotal to assess the effectiveness of environmental regulation (Fischer and Newell, 2008). The extant literature suggests that technology does not develop in isolation (Pistorius and Utterback, 1997, Sandén and Hillman, 2011). In fact, it benefits from heterogeneous sources of externalities that arise from spatial closeness (Keller, 2001, Ertur and Koch, 2007), as well as technological relatedness. On this latter element, recent contributions indicate that technology advances through network-dependent dynamics in which technological progress in one field propels technological development in other linked domains. For instance, Acemoglu et al. (2016) show that knowledge flows neither in a local manner, i.e. with each field drawing only from its previous advancement, nor in a global way, i.e. with all fields sharing a collective pool of knowledge. There are key classes upon which each technological field builds upon; hence, the future rate of inventive activity in a given technology crucially depends on the development of upstream technological domains it draws upon. Similar results are obtained by Taalbi (2020), who makes use of a network structure built upon innovation counts and innovation use across industries, rather than patent data. The recent work by Pichler et al. (2020) further corroborates the idea that technological domains that combine components drawn from fast-growing fields grow faster. Based on these premises, a clear policy implication arises: the impact on a given technological field may depend on the effects that policy has on the technological landscape from which the targeted technology emerges.====How can these insights be applied to the case of green technologies? At the outset, environmentally related technologies mirror other inventions: they ‘often cannot fulfil anything like [their] potential unless other inventions are made relaxing or bypassing constraints which would otherwise hamper [their] diffusion and expansion’ (Rosenberg, 1976 p. 201). Relatedly, we can expect that environmental technologies stem from the recombination of heterogeneous pieces of knowledge in new ways (Kauffman, 1993, Weitzman, 1998, Fleming, 2001, Olsson and Frey, 2002, Tsur and Zemel, 2007, Marchese et al., 2019). In fact, recent evidence highlights that green technology – compared to similar non-green counterparts – tends to introduce new combinations of knowledge and to combine a greater number of technological domains from more diverse fields (Barbieri et al., 2020a). However, these underlying technologies do not necessarily provide environmental benefits but, instead, configure themselves as pillars for green technological advances via the recombination process. The extent to which the development of green technologies depends on advances in non-green fields makes the exploration of the impact of environmental policies of particular interest. More specifically, by adopting this network-based perspective it becomes important to assess whether and to what extent policy interventions impact the development of non-green technologies that trigger technological progress in environmentally related domains – non-green interdependent technologies, hereafter. To this aim, we adopt a conceptualisation of interdependence that is drawn from, among others, Rosenberg (1979), Ertur and Koch (2007) and Pichler et al. (2020), in which the degree of interdependence derives from the extent of interaction between technologies, i.e. the ease of recombination. It follows that two technologies are deemed interdependent when the development of one technology generates positive externalities for the development of the other one.====Accordingly, we ask the following question: What is the impact of environmental policies on non-green interdependent technologies? Our contention is that the displacement of non-green interdependent technologies may hamper the greening of the economy. A few studies from outside the economics debate directly delve into this issue. Markard and Hoffmann (2016) emphasise the dynamic nature of complementarities and highlight that some technologies may compete and complement each other at the same time, as in the case of electricity generation – in which a portfolio of technologies is required to satisfy the internal energy demand – or the co-evolution of Li-Ion batteries and photovoltaic panels. Policy intervention is required to overcome potential barriers and facilitate the creation of technological and sector-level interdependencies. Sinsel et al. (2020) investigate how policymaker intervention shapes the interaction between technologies. They find that feed-in tariffs deploy renewable energy technologies but also affect technological advances in battery systems: specifically, environmental policies disincentivise consumer battery innovation, whereas they have no effects on grid-connected batteries. However, the approach found in these studies is mainly qualitative and focuses on specific flagship green technologies (e.g. renewable energy, batteries, etc.).====Based on these premises, to address the aforementioned issues we move in two directions. The first step in our study is to investigate the interdependencies between green and other technologies that contribute to green technological change via knowledge-combination processes.==== Based on patents filed over the 1978–2014 period, we borrow from the spatial econometrics literature and estimate a spatial autoregressive (SAR) model in which green and non-green technology classification codes, which define the technicalities of an invention, are the units of analysis and the co-occurrence of these codes within the same patent populate the cells of a cognitive distance weight matrix. This first analysis allows us to create a network structure across technology codes through which we capture when and which interdependent technologies relate with the development of green ones.====In a second step, we focus on the impact that environmental policy may exert on non-green interdependent technologies. We exploit the Environmental Policy Stringency Indicator (EPSI) (Botta and Koźluk, 2014) that captures a comprehensive set of environmental policies at the country level, embracing both market-based instruments (e.g. taxes, trading schemes, etc.) and non-market ones (e.g. emission standards, etc.). This measure also allows us to exploit within-country variation, while we account for cross-country unobservable heterogeneity through fixed effects. We further address endogeneity concerns by adopting an instrumental variable approach. We use an index of democratic competition (Vanhanen, 2000) as an instrument for the EPSI. The rationale is that countries with fiercer political competition may be characterised by a shorter horizon of decision making and hence lower environmental policy stringency (Nesta et al., 2014).====Our results indicate that the development of green technologies is strongly related on advances in interdependent technological areas that do not necessarily provide environmental benefits. That is, green technological change intensifies when progress in non-green technologies – previously combined with green knowledge – shows a growing trend. While a causal interpretation is beyond the aim of the first part of our analysis, when comparing the magnitude of non-green and green knowledge-base contributions, the latter appears to be lower. In the second part of our analysis we directly test the effect of environmental policies: we find that the effect on non-green interdependent technologies is not significant. Hence, we exclude the presence of a displacement effect of environmental policy on the technological pillars upon which green inventions emerge.====We contribute to two strands of the literature looking into the relation between technological change and the environment. The first focuses on how technological change can be directed towards the reduction of environmental pressure and solutions to the climate change crisis. Our contribution to this area involves new insight into the possible relation and interdependency – rather than orthogonality – between green and non-green technologies. This literature is aligned with the seminal contribution of Hicks (1932) and builds on the tenet that the increasing costs associated with environmental regulation induce firms to deviate away from polluting technologies to develop and adopt alternative environmentally friendly technologies. For instance, Goulder and Schneider (1999) provide an early analysis of the technological change induced by a carbon emissions abatement policy, showing that a carbon tax discourages R&D in conventional carbon-based energy while stimulating innovation in alternative energy industries, an element that relates to the crowding-out effect of environmental policies, to which we shall return later. Van der Zwaan et al. (2002) investigate the effect of technological change and the optimal path of tax and subsidies over time. They employ a model that incorporates technological change in two separate energy areas, i.e. carbon-intensive energy and carbon-neutral energy, and a learning-by-doing mechanism through which technological performance increases. Another theoretical treatment of the matter can be found in Popp (2004), who develops a model in which energy requirements are met either by fossil fuels or by technological advances that substitute these and depend on dedicated research efforts. His results suggest that optimal carbon policy induces technical change that reduces the cost of compliance. Building on Popp (2004), Coram and Katzner (2018) further elaborate on the optimal path to replace fossil fuels with green technologies and find that given emission-reduction targets, research efforts should be at least as strong at the beginning of a substitution path as at the end. Acemoglu et al. (2012) develop a framework in which goods are produced using substitutable dirty and clean inputs, depending on successful achievements in the betterment of dirty or clean technologies. They draw conclusions on the optimal policy, which involves carbon taxes and research incentives to steer technical change and avoid environmental collapse.====Other works provide an empirical account of the directed technological change. Popp (2002) finds that energy prices as well as the stock of existing knowledge positively influence inventive activities in the field of energy efficiency. Focusing on the automotive sector, Aghion et al. (2016) employ a firm-level analysis to investigate the effect of fuel price, a firm’s own knowledge stock, and country-based knowledge spillovers on the development of clean technologies. They show that firms invent more in clean technologies when they face higher fuel prices. Moreover, prior knowledge on clean technologies as well as knowledge externalities from green patents trigger the development of environmentally sustainable inventions. As far as dirty technologies are concerned, they find that a firm’s own stock of dirty patents positively influences the generation of clean technologies, even if past dirty innovation exerts a greater role in triggering non-green technological change. Spillovers from dirty technologies have a negative impact on the generation of clean technologies. Their analysis also includes grey patents, which aim to improve fuel efficiency, the stock of which is positively associated with green patenting. Calel and Dechezleprêtre (2016) estimate the impact of the European Union Emissions Trading System (ETS) on firm patenting behaviour, finding a positive impact on low-carbon technologies. The effect of the ETS on (British) regulated firms’ inventive activities is further investigated by Calel (2020), who finds that this cap-and-trade policy spurs investment and generation of green inventions rather than the adoption of already-existing clean technologies.====We complement this literature by avoiding a strict dichotomous relation between green and non-green technologies: in our framework, the latter do not necessarily substitute the former. Instead, we directly consider the interdependencies between these two groups of inventions. In this sense, expanding on the idea that green technological solutions may build upon technologies that are not sustainable ====, we contribute to the debate on the direction of technological change, which may not necessarily be away from non-green technologies.====We also contribute to the very related and partially overlapping literature that investigates the extent to which the development of environmentally related technologies comes at the expense of other technological domains. For instance, the analysis offered by  Popp and Newell (2012) shows that patenting in the alternative energy field results in a decrease in inventive activities in other areas. Other studies look more closely at whether this crowding-out mechanism is facilitated by the implementation of policy actions. Some studies directly investigate the role played by environmental policy and provide evidence of a crowding-out process. Barbieri (2016) finds that environmental policies – mainly in the form of tax-inclusive fuel prices – redirect technological change towards green technological fields in the automotive sector. In addition, he finds evidence that advances in one environmentally related domain crowd out inventive efforts in other green domains, pointing out that technological competition also affects the green technology realm. Noailly and Smeets (2015) investigate the effect of fossil fuel prices and renewables market size on technological change. The latter is found to trigger innovation in renewable energy both at the intensive and extensive margin and to reduce the fossil fuel–renewable technology gap by favouring entry dynamics. Fossil fuel prices instead affect innovation in renewable energy and fossil fuel technologies at the intensive margin, in addition to reducing the entry into fossil fuel innovation. Stronger evidence in support of the crowding-out effect is provided by Aghion et al. (2016), who show that while R&D subsidies only affect grey innovation, fossil fuel prices induce innovation in clean technologies at the expense of advancement in dirty ones. Contrary to these pieces of evidence are the insights emerging from Calel and Dechezleprêtre (2016), who find that the ETS has had a positive effect on carbon-intensive technologies – which could be interdependent to green inventions – although the impact is higher when low-carbon solutions are considered. Similar insights come from Calel (2020), who suggests that the cap-and-trade scheme may have a positive effect even on overall firm patenting while disproportionately spurring low-carbon technologies.====All in all, the extant contributions have mainly developed from the recognition of a short-term opportunity cost of moving away from technological domains that could be more profitable than green ones. We complement the extant literature by shedding some light on environmentally friendly technical change and directly focusing on the possible roots that may be found in non-green yet interdependent technologies. We contend that another undesirable effect of environmental policy could paradoxically be that of hampering the development of environmentally sustainable solutions through the displacement of inventive efforts directed towards their non-green technological pillars. In turn, we are concerned with a more dynamic relation between green and non-green technologies, which may be particularly pivotal to facilitate the transition towards greener forms of production.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents the data and how we measure non-green interdependent technologies. Section 3 describes the empirical strategy, Section 4 shows and discusses the results, and Section 5 reports robustness checks. Finally, Section 6 offers some concluding remarks.","Green technologies, interdependencies, and policy",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069623000098,3 February 2023,2023,Research Article,26.0

Our focus is on radical activism which relies on non-violent civil disobedience. The threat of disruptive actions is used to force firms to concede, i.e., to engage in self-regulation. We adopt a mechanism design approach to characterize an optimal campaign. The analysis indicates that the least vulnerable and most polluting firms should be targeted with disruptive actions while the others are granted a guarantee not to be targeted in exchange for concessions. This characterization allows us to study the determinants of the activist’s strength and how it is affected by repression, a central feature in civil disobedience. We find that an optimal campaign is relatively resilient to repression and that it creates incentives to free ride in the prosecution for individual firms. Next, we consider heterogeneity in firms’ ==== and find that an optimal campaign optimizes the allocation of abatement efforts and creates incentives for innovation. We discuss some other welfare properties of the optimal campaign.","The inadequacy of public action around the world to address the global environmental crisis, despite the scientific consensus on its urgency==== is driving ordinary citizens to engage in various forms of activism to pressure firms and government institutions to act.====In this paper, we are interested in the phenomenon of radical environmental activism defined as non-violent civil disobedience movements that engage in ==== actions in order to pressure firms and institutional players to take action in response to the climate emergency (Gunningham, 2019). Recent examples include Ende Gaelende (EG) in Germany and Extinction Rebellion (XR) which is a global movement. Greenpeace is the best-known forerunner of these fast-developing movements. Some of the most famous campaigns that Greenpeace has organized include the Kitkat campaign against Nestlé to raise awareness about deforestation due to the production of palm oil.==== The significance of the threat to business of NGO’s activism aimed at defending the environment, labor and human rights has been documented in Gans and Kaplan (2017) and Culling (2016).====Civil disobedience has long been explored in the philosophical and political science literature (e.g., Thoreau, 1849, Rawls, 2009, Lefkowitz, 2007, Rawls, 2013). A main issue has been its legitimacy and how it combines with the institutions of a democracy. Interestingly, the famous Article 35 of France’s Declaration of Human Rights (1793) states that “====” For radical environmentalists, governments around the world are failing to protect their citizens from the disastrous consequences of the current patterns of exploitation of natural resources. In view of the numerous failed attempts to convince governments to take action within the limits of existing laws, they argue that the situation is one that legitimates civil disobedience.====In this paper we investigate the interaction between radical activists and firms (or government agencies). We focus on how activists can use their disruptive power to achieve the largest improvement in firms’ behavior with respect to the preservation of the environment. Firms’ change in practices are instances of self-regulation and we refer to them as concessions (to the activists’ demands).==== We consider that such situations are characterized by three basic features. The first is that firms are unwilling to self-regulate because that involves costs. Therefore, in the absence of adequate regulation, our activists decide to act directly and confront firms.==== In this respect, we are close to Galbraith (1952) and more recently Daubanes and Rochet (2019) who view activists as a countervailing force to regulators captured by industrial and financial interest groups. The second feature is that any single firm’s vulnerability to disruptive actions (its cost of enduring an attack) typically depends on the complex interplay between technical and economic factors. Therefore, as in Baron and Diermeier (2007), we assume that activists only have incomplete information about firms’ vulnerabilities. The third feature here is that we assume that actions involving non-violent civil disobedience do indeed contribute to generating public support for activists, i.e., actions generate symbolic or political gains. It has been shown that such gains are all the stronger when the actions, even illegal ones, are non-violent and the cause defended is perceived as legitimate (Chenoweth and Stephan, 2011, Feinberg et al., 2020).==== In situations characterized by these three features, we are interested in the following questions: how should the activists’ finite disruptive resources be used to maximize the value of concessions made by firms? What are the criteria for targeting any particular firm with disruptive actions? What are the determinants of the activists’ strength? What is the impact of police and judicial repression? What are the welfare properties of an optimal activist campaign?====To answer these questions, we develop a campaign mechanism whereby an activist (group) threatens privately-informed firms with disruptive actions, with the aim of extracting concessions in terms of self-regulation measures that reduce the firms’ environmental damage. While all the firms in the campaign are threatened, only a smaller number are actually targeted, and the others end up self-regulating. To achieve this outcome, the activist effectively creates competition between firms seeking to avoid being targeted. This allows capturing an empirically established regularity. According to a number of studies (e.g., McDonnell and King, 2013, Hiatt et al., 2015, Briscoe and Gupta, 2016), environmental activism affects significantly more firms than those that may actually be harmed by activist actions. In addition, putting firms in competition with each other (to avoid being harmed) helps achieve the largest environmental gains from a given disruptive power, in a situation of incomplete information. Formally, we adopt a mechanism design approach closely related to the developments in Koessler and Lambert-Mogiliansky (2014). The model covers quite general situations in which firms may be asymmetric with respect to their expected vulnerability and their efficiency in damage reduction, and where the political gain (or loss) from taking action in response to activist pressure may either decrease or increase a firm’s vulnerability.====The optimal campaign mechanism that we derive is characterized by the thresholds that determine whether a firm is targeted or not. The thresholds depend on firms’ vulnerability and the political gain associated with taking action. Little-vulnerable big polluters are the first to be targeted. The intuition is that the more vulnerable a firm, the more it is willing to make concessions to avoid attack. The optimal campaign mechanism also determines the magnitude of the concessions paid in equilibrium by the firms that are not targeted. For the case firms are ex-ante symmetric, a simple auction-concession game implements the optimal mechanism. Next, we investigate the determinants of the strength of the activist, measured by three indicators: the probability for action, the size of concessions and the overall gain from the campaign (concessions and political gains). Our results are quite intuitive and allow addressing the impact of repression. Gandhi and Martin Luther King viewed the acceptance of physical and legal risks as a core principle of civil disobedience. This is because repression provides the opportunity of exposing the illegitimacy of a policy to a larger public, as well as the immorality of repression (DeNardo, 1985, Opp and Roehl, 1990, Chenoweth and Stephan, 2011, Ayanian and Tausch, 2016, Aytaç et al., 2018). Davenport (2007) defines the “punishment puzzle” as the empirically-established fact that the impact of repression can go either way, i.e., to embolden the activists or reduce their strength (e.g., Francisco, 1996, Gupta et al., 1993, Young, 2019, Edwards, 2021). We take these two contrasting effects into consideration and we find that in our model the class of situations in which repression is counter-productive is non-empty: optimal non-violent activism is quite resilient. Increased repression may lead to more actions, larger concessions and a larger general gain. We note that our results imply that the government faces rather extreme choices: either it effectively concedes to disobedience (implementing a strategy of ‘negotiated accommodation’ as advocated by Smith (2012)), or it applies harsh repression. As we consider firm-specific repression (e.g., prosecution), the optimal campaign mechanism is shown to create incentives for firms to free-ride on prosecution. The intuition is that a firm known for prosecuting activists becomes a more attractive target for actions relative to other firms. Competition to avoid being targeted benefits the activists yet in another way. We next focus on heterogeneity in firms’ abatement efficiency. We show that our model can be adapted to this instance of non-transferability in utility, and we find that our optimal campaign mechanism delivers an efficient allocation of the overall abatement cost between firms. The firms most efficient with respect to pollution abatement are more prone to concede under threat, because of lower compliance costs. In addition, an optimal campaign induces interesting cross effects that stimulate innovation in damage reduction. Thereafter, we consider two extensions to address the case when attacked firms concede and how the activists select the population of firms==== Finally, we address some social welfare issues to note that optimal activism is not Pareto-efficient by construction, but is endowed with interesting efficiency properties. We conclude with an extensive discussion of the empirical literature.==== At present, there only exists a limited literature on activism in economics. Baron and Diermeier (2007) study strategic activism in a model in which an activist confronts a firm with a campaign including a demand, a reward and a disruptive action. In their article, the authors touch upon a number of questions and make conjectures. In particular, they note that activism shows similarity with extortion and that the activist can benefit from competition between firms. The present work investigates these conjectures. Baron, 2012, Baron, 2016 is also closely related to the present work. He analyzes the choices of activists who use the threat of a campaign to induce firms to self-regulate. Our approach, however, is quite different. Baron’s model is based on a market for activists, in which activists monitor firms in bilateral relationships while we develop a model whereby firms compete in concessions under threat. Daubanes and Rochet (2019) build on Baron’s model to explain the growing role of NGOs as a response to the capture of regulators by powerful industry lobbies. In a different setting, Egorov and Harstad (2017) study the dynamics of conflict between NGOs and firms, and investigate under what circumstances a benevolent regulator can resolve the situation. Closely related is also the work by Heyes et al. (2018) who study a salience game in which an industry and an NGO compete in influence over limited public attention concerning social or environmental impacts.====Our paper is related to another strand of literature that addresses firms’ incentive to self-regulate. A central contribution is in Maxwell et al. (2000), followed by Lyon and Maxwell (2004). They investigate pre-emptive environmental self-regulation in a model in which there is a threat of regulation, determined by a costly influence game between firms and consumers. Calveras et al. (2007) endogenize environmental regulation when firms self-regulate in response to consumer and voter environmental awareness.====Our work also contributes to the limited literature on coercion in economics. Konrad and Skaperdas, 1997, Konrad and Skaperdas, 1998 adopt a game theoretical approach to study racketeering by criminal gangs with focus on the issue of the credibility of the threat. Koessler and Lambert-Mogiliansky (2014) adopt a mechanism design approach to study bureaucratic corruption and its response to political risk insurance. In the same vein, we use the tools of mechanism design to characterize an optimal activist campaign, and we derive new results related to activism-related issues, such as resilience to repression and efficiency of the allocation of abatement costs among asymmetric firms. The ambiguous effect of repression of collective action was addressed by Siegel (2011), who adopts a network theoretical argument to investigate how participation is affected by repression. In Shadmehr and Boleslavsky (2022), it is the public’s uncertainty about the merits of activists’ demands and the intentions of state repression that can lead to the stifling or, conversely, the amplification of the movement.====A main contribution of this paper is to provide a formal analysis of the power of the threat of disruptive actions on firms’s behavior with respect to the harm their activities bring to the environment. For this purpose, we have characterized the properties of an optimal campaign mechanism aimed at maximizing firms’ concessions to environmental damage reduction, relying on limited disruptive resources. The mechanism design approach features both competition between firms and the similarity with extortion, suggested by Baron and Diermeier (2007). We show how it allows exploiting optimally the threat of disruptive actions by creating competition between firms, while accommodating imperfect transferability reflecting heterogeneity with respect to firms’ abatement efficiency. Our analysis characterizes conditions for repression to be counter-productive when directed against non-violent activism. A free-riding effect in prosecution arising from competition between firms to avoid disruptive actions further reveals the power of the mechanism. The analysis provides a contribution to the burgeoning literature on the economics of coercion.====The article is structured as follows. In the next section we present the framework and characterize the optimal campaign mechanism. In Section 3, we focus on the determinants of the strength of activism. In Section 4, we examine the impact of police and judicial repression. Section 5 develops the campaign mechanism when firms are asymmetric with respect to their damage abatement efficiency. Several extensions of the basic model are addressed in Section 6. Section 7 gathers some elements of welfare analysis and Section 8 provides a discussion of our results in light of the existing literature.",Radical activism and self-regulation: An optimal campaign mechanism,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069623000074,31 January 2023,2023,Research Article,27.0

We study the impact of air pollution on traffic accidents caused by risky driving behaviors, using the universe of accident records and high-resolution air quality data of Taiwan from 2009 to 2015. We find that air pollution significantly decreases accidents with casualties caused by driver violations, and that this effect is nonlinear. In addition, such negative effects are only observed in time when road users can visually assess air pollution levels, suggesting that air quality primarily reduces road users’ risky behaviors through visual channels rather than through the respiratory system.","Economic studies have extensively documented the adverse effects of air pollution on health and various societal outcomes (for a recent review, see Currie and Walker 2019). Within this line of literature, many studies have underlined the role of compensatory behaviors against air pollution in identifying the adverse effects of interest (e.g., Moretti and Neidell 2011; Graff Zivin and Neidell 2013). Most, if not all, of these studies implicitly assume that any behavioral changes are optimal responses to given levels of air pollution while holding preferences constant, which is in accordance with the canonical assumption of stable preferences (Stigler and Becker 1977). However, a more recent strand of economic literature, corroborating with evidence from biomedical research (e.g., Coates and Herbert 2008; Kandasamy et al., 2014; Li et al., 2017), has found that elevated air pollution leads to a higher degree of risk aversion (Chew et al., 2021) and discourages financial risk-taking behaviors (Heyes et al., 2016; Levy and Yagil 2011; Li et al., 2019). A few studies have also documented that risk preferences in financial domains are malleable due to transient variations in atmospheric conditions, which are often associated with air quality (Bassi et al., 2013; Kliger and Levy 2003).====In this study, we show that elevated air pollution can discourage life-threatening risky behaviors, even when the effect of avoidance behavior is isolated. We investigate the contemporaneous effect of air pollution on traffic accidents with casualties caused by any drivers involved in committing a traffic violation, a risky behavior that poses immediate threat to lives. Our analyses leverage the administrative traffic accident records of Taiwan for the years 2009 through 2015, which includes more than 1.1 million such accidents, as well as high-resolution air quality data integrating satellite, ground monitoring, long-term emission, and land use data. To overcome the endogeneity between traffic accidents and air pollution, we use wind directions to induce exogenous variations in air quality. Based on our preferred specification, we find that a 1 μg/m==== increase in PM==== concentration decreases the number of accidents with casualties caused by driver violations by 0.59%. This negative effect is robust to a host of different specifications. Although we believe that our instrumental variable approach has accounted for the biases stemming from avoidance behavior against air pollution, we perform auxiliary analyses and find no evidence showing that avoidance behavior can be a credible competing explanation for the reduced number of accidents.==== Moreover, given that we focus on accidents with casualties, the reduction could also be a result of traffic congestion or the nonlinear relationship between traffic volumes and accident severity (Hughes et al., 2022; Theofilatos and Yannis 2014). We find very similar reductions when we focus on time and places with lower congestion potential and exclude accidents caused by violations related to speeding, suggesting that congestion can only explain a small portion, if not little, of the impacts.====Air pollution could lead to more traffic accidents through impaired physiological functions, a mechanism which has been highlighted in the literature on the adverse effects of air pollution on cognitive performance and labor productivity.==== Indeed, Sager (2019), the first economic study focusing on the effect of air quality on road safety to our knowledge, finds elevated PM==== concentration increases the number of vehicles involved in ==== accidents with casualties in the United Kingdom and considers cognitive impairment as the main mechanism. That is, the existing evidence suggests that, while holding avoidance behavior fixed, air pollution can affect road safety in two opposite ways: by decreasing traffic accidents through increased degree of risk aversion, and by increasing accidents through impaired physiological functions. This is particularly relevant when the dose-response relationships between air pollution and risk attitude/physiological functions are nonlinear so that the combined effect on road accidents can be either positive or negative. To shed light on the effect of air pollution on risky behaviors, we primarily focus on accidents with casualties caused by traffic violations and explore the potential nonlinear effects. We also examine the effect of air pollution on accidents with casualties caused by mindless errors (lapses), on which risk aversion should have a smaller impact while impaired physiological functions can be relatively more important.====We further explore the transmission channels through which air quality influences risk preferences and the associated behaviors. Inhalation exposure has been recognized as the primary route of air pollution affecting humans (Brook et al., 2002; Gurgueira et al., 2002). It is plausible to postulate that inhalation again is the main channel for air quality to change people's risk preferences and risky behaviors. Still, air pollution can also influence human behaviors through visual channels without direct exposure. Lu et al. (2018) find that individuals show higher levels of anxiety by simply looking at pictures of polluted air. Higher levels of particulate matter, NO====, and SO==== can lead to higher light attenuation and soften the sky color, so the sky looks gray or hazy (Huang et al., 2014; Ouimette and Flagan 1982). Studies in both economics and psychology have shown that gloomy or smoky sky makes humans more risk averse and pessimistic (Bassi et al., 2013; Goetzmann et al., 2015; Hirshleifer and Shumway 2003; Kliger and Levy 2003; Saunders 1993). We therefore hypothesize that elevated air pollution levels can also affect risk preferences and the associated risky behaviors by making a more visually gloomy surrounding. We find that air pollution only reduces accidents when air quality can be visually assessed, indicating that air pollution can discourage risky driving behaviors through visual channels.==== However, somewhat surprisingly, the effects are homogenous across drivers who are physically exposed to substantially different levels of air pollution, so we do not find evidence showing that the respiratory system plays a role.====Overall, this paper contributes to the literature on at least four important fronts. First, our results highlight the role of risk attitudes when estimating the costs of air pollution stemming from impaired physiological functions. For example, for any given severity of illness, the decision to seek health care is often a function of individuals' risk preferences. On the other hand, cognitive ability and risk aversion interrelatedly affect many economic outcomes at individual level (Dohmen et al., 2010; Heckman et al., 2006). Failure to isolate the effect of risk preferences may therefore prejudice the causal interpretation of the estimated effects of air pollution on many socio-economic outcomes.==== Second, we provide new evidence showing that air pollution can discourage life-concerning risky behaviors and contribute to the line of studies on the determinants of risky behaviors (e.g., Dohmen et al., 2011; Schoemaker 1993). Our findings also provide suggestive evidence showing that risk preferences are transiently malleable due to exogenous shocks (Schildberg-Hörisch 2018). Third, using data from Taiwan where the air quality is worse than that of many highly-developed countries, our results complement the findings from Sager (2019) and enhance the external validity of the studies quantifying the effect of air quality on road safety. The external validity is particularly relevant given that we find such an effect is nonlinear and more than 90% of the world's traffic fatalities occur in low- and middle-income countries where the air pollution levels are high (World Health Organization 2018). Last but not least, we provide, to our knowledge, the first evidence suggesting the transmission channels through which air quality affects risky behaviors. As we discuss later, this finding has important implications for studies quantifying the economic costs from different air pollutants.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

To this end, we collated the largest ratification dataset in the literature and identified all countries eligible for membership in each agreement. This feature allows to correct the identification bias associated with the misidentification of the risk set when regional agreements are included in the regression sample. We also improve the treatment of unobserved heterogeneity by using a multilevel survival approach and ==== (MCMC) estimator. Overall, we find that countries’ participation choices are interrelated and primarily driven by the agreements’ characteristics. Our findings indicate that regional agreements are two and half times more likely to be ratified than global agreements and that environmental lobbying positively affects participation in environmental agreements, while the effect of industrial lobbying is statistically insignificant. This result is robust to changes in specification and proxies used. Our results motivate several policy suggestions. We emphasise regional agreements’ capacity to deliver higher participation than global agreements and the importance of securing the early ratification of key players.","International cooperation is required to solve some of the most severe environmental problems of our times. Air pollution, contamination of lakes and rivers, global warming, biodiversity loss, deforestation, desertification, and over-fishing are all problems that cross national borders and simultaneously affect several nations. In these cases, no single policymaker possesses the power to enforce environmental policies in all concerned countries. This decentralisation of power calls for a horizontal approach based on cooperation (Barrett, 2005). In theory, there is a clear incentive to cooperate since total welfare increases when environmental issues are addressed multilaterally (Carraro and Siniscalco, 1998). However, spontaneous cooperation is not guaranteed due to the absence of a central authority with the power to enforce international agreements, which creates incentives to free ride on commitments and enjoy the benefits of the agreement without bearing the costs of participation (Barrett, 2008).====International environmental agreements (IEAs) are the primary cooperative tool to solve such transboundary issues. To date, there are more than three thousand bilateral and multilateral environmental agreements in force (Mitchell, 2017). Participation in an agreement is fundamental for its success because international agreements are only binding for participating countries. Hence, this study attempts to answer the following questions: what are the drivers of participation in environmental agreements? How can participation be increased? This paper is part of a growing body of empirical research studying the drivers of participation in environmental agreements (e.g. Congleton, 1992, Neumayer, 2002a, von Stein, 2008, Bernauer et al., 2010, Bernauer et al., 2013b). We attempt to expand this literature in two directions.====First, we collated a new data set on ratification of environmental agreements, which identifies the potential ratifiers for each agreement. This unique characteristic allows us, and future researchers, to study the determinants of participation in regional environmental agreements and solve the bias that could arise from the misidentification of the risk set. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study attempting to control for the different potential ratification set of regional agreements. These agreements play an important role in safeguarding natural resources because many environmental issues have a geographically limited scope: e.g., management of freshwater resources, protection of habitats and ecosystems, pollution of rivers and lakes. Consequently, most environmental agreements involve a limited number of countries (Fig. 1).====Secondly, this paper seeks to improve our understanding of the impact of domestic interest groups on participation. In particular, this paper tries to generalise to a large sample of agreements the analysis conducted by Fredriksson et al. (2007) on climate change treaties (the UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol). This line of enquiry is a direct response to the recent developments in the theoretical literature that emphasise the domestic choice-making process of treaty participation (e.g. Habla and Winkler, 2013, Marchiori et al., 2017, Battaglini and Harstad, 2020, Hagen et al., 2021).====Our results indicate that regional agreements are more than twice as likely to attract ratification. This finding supports the claim by Asheim et al. (2006) and Osmani and Tol (2010) – among others – who argue that a more efficient approach to tackle global environmental issues could be to design a set of interrelated regional agreements instead of a single global treaty. With regards to the activity of interest groups, we generally do not find a negative effect of industrial lobbying on ratification. This result is robust to changes in proxies used and is in line with the results of Fredriksson et al. (2007) and Sauquet (2014) for the UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol. Finally, our study broadly corroborates the results of the literature, which highlight the importance of the interactions between nations and the role of institutions. We validate these results by using the largest ratification dataset to date, solving the identification bias associated with regional agreements, and by using a modelling approach more robust to unobserved heterogeneity.====In the next section, we briefly discuss the theoretical and empirical literature on environmental agreement participation. Then, in Section 3, we introduce our new ratification dataset and explain our empirical approach. The results are reported in Section 4. We conclude the paper by listing seven stylised facts and discussing the policy implications of our findings.

We develop a theoretical model in which firms jointly determine the extent of abatement investment as well as whether or not to import ==== and export final goods. The model demonstrates a complementarity between trading decisions and abatement investment such that trading firms invest more in abatement technology and feature lower emission intensities. Using Chinese firm-level data, we estimate a theory-based regression model with instrument variables to account for the endogeneity issue associated with firms’ trading statuses. Our regression results show that both importing and exporting reduce firm-level emission intensities by over 15 percent.","How does international trade impact firms’ environmental performance? In this paper, we answer this question with a model that links firms’ import, export, and abatement decisions in a single framework. Our theory suggests that firms have a greater incentive to invest in abatement technology when they become importers, exporters, or both, and hence their firm-level emission intensities, defined as mass of emissions normalized by the real value of output, decline in response to trade liberalization. Our empirical results confirm that both importing and exporting contributed to significant reduction of firm-level emission intensities in China in the first decade of the 21st century.====Although voluminous studies have shown that ==== improves firm-level environmental outcomes (e.g., Holladay (2016), Forslid et al. (2018), Shapiro and Walker (2018), Rodrigue et al. (2022a)), there is scant evidence on whether ==== also generates a similar effect.==== Against this backdrop, our paper aims to instate the key role that importing plays in reducing firms’ emission intensities. Our contributions in this paper can be summarized as follows. First, we propose a theoretical model that elucidates how firms’ decision to import intermediate inputs leads to an increase in abatement investment and, hence, a reduction in their emission intensities. An extension of our model that allows firms to export final goods shows that both importing and exporting can reduce firms’ emission intensities. Intuitively, if firms pay certain fees for emissions, firms that have become larger due to importing or exporting (or both) have greater incentive to invest in abatement to lower emissions per unit of output.====For our second contribution, we exploit the structural decomposition of firm-level emission intensities guided by our model and estimate the relevant parameters with Chinese firm-level data. Our IV regression results show that both importing and exporting led to sizable reduction in firm-level emission intensities across three different types of emissions: chemical oxygen demand (COD), sulfur dioxide (SO====), and nitrogen oxide (NOX). Furthermore, we validate our theoretical framework by confirming its mechanism with data. We show that both importing and exporting significantly increase Chinese firms’ water treatment capacities and their removal of COD, SO==== and NOX emissions.====Lastly, we adopt a novel empirical strategy to demonstrate that the import-side mechanism is not driven by pollution offshoring hypothesis (POH) — a competing mechanism that is known to create a negative link between importing and emission intensities. Intuitively, we show that importing reduces firms’ emission intensities even if we limit our attention to a subset of imported intermediate inputs that do not cause pollution offshoring.==== These results further substantiate our theoretical framework which suggests that firms’ emission abatement is reinforced by international trade.====Overall, our paper demonstrates that both importing and exporting – dual characteristics of global firms – contribute to lower emission intensities at the firm level. We believe that our study on Chinese firms during the first decade of the twenty-first century is particularly relevant for other developing countries undergoing similar trends of trade liberalization.====In Fig. 1, we present the trends in trade openness and three major types of emission intensities in our study. We observe that China’s trade openness (sum of imports and exports normalized by the nominal GDP) increased significantly between 2000 and 2013. In contrast, the levels of emission intensities (total mass of emissions normalized by the real GDP) fell sharply during the same period.====For a micro-level comparison, we present in Table 1 the log-differences of firms’ average emission intensities in each trading type relative to domestic firms. We consider four types of firms: domestic, importing-only, exporting only, and firms that both import and export. Note that both importing and exporting firms exhibit considerably lower emission intensities than domestic firms. Existing literature (e.g., Holladay (2016), Forslid et al. (2018), Shapiro and Walker (2018), and Rodrigue et al. (2022a)) documents that ==== firms exhibit lower emission intensities than domestic firms, but less is well established as to how and why ==== also reduces firm level emission intensities.==== Moreover, we observe that firms that both import and export exhibit the ==== pollution intensities among all types of firms, suggesting that the impacts from importing and exporting can be “stacked” together.====Motivated by Table 1, we investigate whether international trade has a causal impact of lowering firm-level emission intensities. We propose a novel framework in which firms’ import, export and abatement decisions are jointly determined. The model predicts that firms engaging in import and export invest more in abatement and thus feature lower emission intensities than they would otherwise do if they were not trading. Capitalizing on detailed Chinese firm-level emissions data, we then use a set of IV regressions to show that the model prediction is borne out in the data and that the results are robust against the competing POH hypothesis. Furthermore, we empirically assess the potential bias in the estimates of exporter coefficients if researchers fail to include both importer and exporter statuses in the same regression.==== Our paper is closely related to Rodrigue et al. (2022a) which show that enhanced exporting opportunities since the accession to the WTO reduced firm-level emissions in China by over 36 percent. Our paper complements Rodrigue et al. (2022a) by emphasizing the role of importing and provides a comprehensive understanding of how international trade affects firm-level emission intensities. Crucially, we show that importing has negative effects on emission intensities in addition to the export channel.====Our paper contributes to the emerging literature that explores the impact of international trade on firm-level emissions.==== Holladay (2016) and Cui et al. (2016) show that US exporting firms exhibit lower emission intensities after controlling for individual firm characteristics. A key distinction of our paper is to adopt IV to establish the causal effects on emission intensities.==== Forslid et al. (2018) endogenize firm-level investment in abatement technology in a Chaney–Melitz style heterogeneous firm model.==== They show that exporting firms invest additionally in abatement technology, and thus they exhibit lower emission intensities than otherwise comparable domestic firms. Shapiro and Walker (2018) develop a general equilibrium model of endogenous trade and emission abatement. Armed with the estimated parameters, Shapiro and Walker (2018) persuasively show that the declining emissions in the US since the 1990s is attributable to more stringent environmental protection policies. Our paper is also related to Cherniwchan (2017), which finds that the emissions of PM==== and SO==== from the US plants dropped significantly as a result of NAFTA. In comparison, we theoretically demonstrate that importing enhances firms’ abatement investment and confirm this mechanism empirically.====More broadly, there has been sustained research interest to investigate the interaction between globalization and the environment.==== Seminal papers by Copeland and Taylor (1994) and Grossman and Krueger (1995) were followed up by subsequent empirical findings including (but not limited to) Antweiler et al. (2001), Levinson (2009), Bombardini and Li (2020) and Najjar and Cherniwchan (2021). Overall, the literature does not provide a consensus on how globalization affects the environment. As Cherniwchan and Taylor (2022) suggest, there are numerous margins of trade that can affect the environment, and thus studies should focus on specific margins. Our paper uses rich firm-level information to investigate the import margin of trade, which is equally important as the export margin well established in the literature.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present our baseline model to illustrate why firms endogenously reduce emission intensities if they import intermediate inputs or export final goods.

In the U.S., land protection has expanded rapidly in recent decades, motivated by the continued loss of open space to development (Nelson et al., 2007; Kotchen and Powers 2006). This increase has been facilitated by state and federal funding (The Trust for Public Lands 2021; Stubbs 2020), shifts in land ownership (Meyer et al., 2014), tax incentives (Parker and Thurman 2018), and funding for open space protection through local referenda (Lang 2018). Substantial federal funding is currently available for new land protection through the reauthorized Land and Water Conservation Fund (National Park Service 2020) and the Farm Bill (Stubbs 2020) as well as the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act (Congressional Research Service 2022) and infrastructure bills (Rigley 2021).====The surge in funding has renewed debate about the fiscal implications of land protection. Land that is protected through conservation restrictions or under ownership by public and non-profit organizations is frequently tax-exempt or taxed at lower rates than developed or unprotected land. Critics of new land protection worry that it will erode local property tax bases and result in higher property tax rates for other landowners (Brandon 2021; Ricketts 2021; Rule 2019; Neuman 2018; LePage 2018; McWhirter 2014). These concerns have fueled opposition to both local land protection efforts (LePage 2018) and national conservation initiatives including President Biden's 30-by-30 conservation target (Brandon 2021). Proponents of land protection counter by arguing that open space pays for itself because it requires less in municipal expenditures than it contributes to revenues, or because it creates recreation-based economic opportunities and amenity values that increase the property tax base (e.g., Davis et al., 2018; The Trust for Public Land 2007).====Despite the crucial role that local property taxes play in funding public goods, few studies have quantified the possible causal impacts of land protection on property tax rates to inform this debate (Vandegrift and Lahr 2011; King and Anderson 2004). Indeed, estimating these relationships is difficult due to the potentially endogenous nature of land protection. For example, communities that engage in more land protection may tend to have greater wealth, past histories of land protection, or more to gain from recreation-based economies. Alternatively, communities with more land protection may be more rural and have fewer development opportunities.====To overcome these potential selection bias concerns, we exploit plausibly exogenous changes in land protection over time within municipalities. Specifically, we estimate the effects of new land protection on changes in local property tax rates using municipal-level panel data from 1990 to 2015 across five New England states. Our data combines information on property tax rates, property tax levies, and taxable property value for more than 1400 municipalities in the region (also referred to as New England's “towns and cities”). We match these with detailed spatial data on new land protection over time assembled by the Harvard Forest and the Highstead Foundation, which follow the Protected Areas Database of the United States (PAD-US) in defining protected lands as areas “dedicated to the preservation of biological diversity and to other natural, recreational and cultural uses, managed for these purposes through legal or other effective means” (U.S. Geological Survey, 2022).====Our regression model estimates changes in property tax rates as a function of lagged changes in land protection, with controls for state-by-time-period fixed effects, core-based statistical area trends, and lagged changes in the labor force, unemployment, and property tax base growth. This approach differences out unobserved time-invariant characteristics of municipalities and reduces serial correlation. The key identifying assumption inherent to this empirical strategy is that the timing of new protection within municipalities, conditional on these controls, is exogenous to potential outcomes. This is plausible because protection in the region is the result of decentralized and uncoordinated actions by more than 350 separate land trusts, hundreds of local governments, and multiple state and federal agencies. Land trusts overlap in their spatial jurisdictions and missions (Wildlands and Woodlands 2021; Foster et al., 2017; Labich 2015), and many local protections have been driven by the efforts of just a few committed individuals. In addition, opportunities for protection often occur when there is a generational shift within families due to retirements, health shocks, or deaths (Markowski-Lindsay et al., 2017; Bigelow et al., 2016). The nature of these protection processes within New England creates considerable randomness in the extent and timing of new land protection.====We estimate average effects and test for differential impacts across land protection types and by several key characteristics of the communities where land protection is occurring. We also examine fiscal outcomes (municipal revenues, expenditures) for the states with available data in order to study broader fiscal responses to land protection and we estimate a model with lagged protection to investigate longer-term impacts on tax rates.====We find that on average, new land protection has had small impacts on property tax rates. We estimate an expected increase in annual property tax rates of $0.0231 per $1000 of value that is attributable to a one percentage point increase in new municipal area protected annually. For an annual increase in new land protection of 100 acres, this property tax rate change translates to an annual property tax bill increase of just $1.16 per $100,000 of value, or $3.00 for an owner of a typical New England home.We do not find evidence that municipalities collect less revenue or reduce expenditures on public goods as a result of land protection, or that there are additional longer-term impacts on the tax rate.====While average impacts are small, we do observe important heterogeneity in property tax bill impacts by land protection type and local characteristics, with annual increases of up to $10 per $100,000 of home valuation. The types of towns that are associated with greater estimated impacts are those that are growing slowly, have lower median incomes, have less land enrolled in current use programs that allow reduced taxes for agriculture and forestry, or have fewer second homes. We also find suggestive evidence for larger tax increases associated with land protection conducted by municipalities, particularly in towns and cities with smaller property tax bases or slower growth.====Overall, our findings indicate that the property tax rate changes due to land protection are generally not substantial, particularly in comparison to the magnitude of changes that residents may experience for capital projects such as new buildings or increases in municipal staff. Yet the heterogeneity in impacts highlights the reality that some communities may be at higher risk for greater tax burdens. These differences emphasize a need for public compensation mechanisms, such as state and federal payments in lieu of taxes, that can assist communities engaging in land protection, and provide a rationale for targeting these programs to the types of communities that may be most impacted by new land protection.",Does land conservation raise property taxes?

The method measures benefits using “structural transfer factors”. It is considered a structural method for developing benefit measures because its unit benefit measures are derived from a specific, theoretically consistent, preference specification. Initially developed by Baumgärtner et al. [2017], the method has been extended by this research team in several subsequent applications.==== It could be considered a middle ground between using unit values or value functions in benefit transfers. The simplest form of a unit value transfer uses an estimate of the central value (i.e. a median or a mean) for the willingness to pay for some change in the amount (or quality) of an environmental service from existing studies and applies the implied ==== per ==== of the change involved to a proposed change in a comparable environmental service. It is usually interpreted as an estimate of the unit value that a representative individual would have for the proposed change.====Two types of value functions have been discussed in the literature. The first type is a reduced form model that provides a statistical summary of a selected set of willingness to pay estimates. These models specify the estimated willingness to pay measures as a function of the amount of change in the environmental service in each study, as well as summary statistics describing the respondents involved in each study. In some cases, they also include variables describing the methods used in the primary benefit studies.==== The second approach for developing a function to describe existing benefit estimates relies on a specific preference function and uses the existing benefit estimates to calibrate the parameters of that function (see Smith et al., [2002]). It has been labeled preference calibration.==== By contrast with these approaches, the BDMMQ proposal relies on the specific relationship between a unit benefit measure for a change in an environmental service and preference parameters that are implied by that utility function. It is not as demanding as the preference calibration logic because the unit benefit measure can be expressed in terms of a smaller number of preference parameters. This is certainly the case with the function used in BDMMQ's applications. Of course, the logic associated with their approach could be implemented using a more general, preference specification. However, with more general specifications it seems likely that the analysis would require estimates for a larger number of preference parameters.====Unit transfers assume that a single estimate for a marginal value, constant in real terms, can be applied to the average person experiencing the change in the environmental services that is being evaluated. The value function is often derived from meta-analyses where reduced form regression models are generally used to combine estimates across past valuation studies.====The BDMMQ approach allows the analyst to derive structural transfer factors as functions of the parameters describing the heterogeneity in income levels as well as any potential diversity in the environmental services in the studies used to derive the benefit measures. These differences can also include differences in the locations affected by the policies being evaluated. My analysis focuses on using their method to account for income inequality. I do not consider heterogeneity in the environmental services experienced by the individuals included in different benefit studies. I use the ratio of two values for their definition for willingness to pay to develop an index of the effects of income inequality on the BDMMQ transfer factors. These ratios are specified to illustrate how the values assumed for preference parameters and for the functions describing the income distributions can influence their transfer factors.====Using administrative data on income at different spatial scales I find that the most important factor influencing the BDMMQ adjustment to their transfer factor for income inequality is ==== the extent of that inequality. Rather, it is the income elasticity of willingness to pay (WTP) for the environmental services involved. Holding the preference specification constant and the distribution function describing the income heterogeneity constant (using either a lognormal or a Dagum [1977], [1980] function to describe the income distribution), a variation of 0.1, say from 0.1 to 0.2 or from 0.6 to 0.7, in the BDMMQ definition of the income elasticity of willingness to pay can lead to nearly a doubling in the ratio I use as a scaling factor.==== Moreover, if I hold the income elasticity constant at different levels and vary the function used to describe income distributions between the ==== used for the benefit measures and the ==== location experiencing the change in environmental services due to the policy being evaluated, the effects of the income inequality are more pronounced for high values of the income elasticity of WTP as the income inequality increases. However, the differences are not as pronounced as in the cases where the value assumed for the income elasticity of WTP is varied and the income distribution held constant. Moreover, these findings hold when either the lognormal function or the Dagum function is used to describe the income distribution in the target area for the transfer.====One might ask –are these results surprising? Meta analyses of unit benefit measures have routinely found that the benefit measures vary with the ==== values of the incomes of the groups involved in each of the studies included in these summaries. However, this analysis has identified a ==== effect. It arises by using an index for how the expected willingness to pay responds to a ==== in the income elasticity of WTP. The simplified form of BDMMQ's WTP function allows my findings to be evaluated using an analytical expression for the relationship between their expression for the income elasticity of WTP and the parameters of the BDMMQ preference function. It implies that the proportional change in BDMMQ's definition for WTP is influenced by the ==== of the change in the income elasticity.====These comparisons indicate that the key “unknown” parameter is the income elasticity of willingness to pay. Thus, efforts to introduce adjustments for the effects of income inequality for the practices used in benefit transfer should ==== consider what we know about this elasticity across different types of environmental services. Moreover, the estimates from the existing empirical studies are not directly relevant to the BDMMQ analysis. The definition of the income elasticity of WTP used in these studies is not the same as that used by BDMMQ. This difference arises because these authors rely on a ==== definition for WTP. It uses the Ebert [2003] first order approximation for WTP. Equally important, it is reasonable to expect that this elasticity will vary for different types of environmental services and for populations with very different income levels. In their efforts to provide some general indication of the sensitivity of the conventional definition for WTP estimates to income, Kristrom and Riera [1996] and Barbier et al. [2017] combined empirical results across different studies where both the resources and the populations involved were different. Nonetheless, their findings suggest there can be a wide range of values for the elasticity depending on populations involved. As a result, the focus of new research should be on developing estimates for a consistently defined income elasticity of WTP that allow analysts to gauge the range of possible values for this key parameter in different policy contexts.====Section 2 outlines the BDMMQ model. I describe how the assumptions about the value of their expression for the income elasticity of WTP can influence the Ebert [2003] approximation that BDMMQ used to define willingness to pay. The next section describes how the BDMMQ expression for WTP allows the ratio of two measures of the expected WTP values, each defined with different assumptions, can serve as an index for gauging the importance of income inequality. This index depends on both their approximation and the functional form assumed for the income distribution. I illustrate this sensitivity using both the function they assumed for the income distribution in their analysis, a lognormal, as well as using the Dagum function to describe the income distribution. After presenting the index, I describe the administrative and survey data used to evaluate it. This section also outlines how the Akaike [1973] Information Criterion (AIC) is used to select between the lognormal and the Dagum functions for describing the distributions implied by the administrative and survey data used in my examples.====Section 4 presents the findings from varying four elements in the analysis, including: the distribution function, the assumed values for the income elasticity of WTP, the spatial scale used for the administrative data, and the type of comparison involved. This last dimension is illustrated using reported income from the 2017 Phoenix Area Social Survey (PASS) along with the administrative data (Internal Revenue Service (IRS) frequency distributions) at different spatial scales.====Section 5 “steps back” from the strategy proposed by BDMMQ and considers the way income inequality concerns were addressed in the early benefit cost literature, beginning with Krutilla and Eckstein [1958], Haveman [1965], and Weisbrod [1968]. I argue this type of comparison is warranted because the early focus was on using weighting functions to adjust the components of aggregate benefit measures to reflect the equity effects of the policies being evaluated. This approach contrasts with the current benefit transfer practice that multiplies a unit benefit estimate times the number of households (or individuals) assumed to be affected by each policy.==== As a result, in the current setting, it is natural for BDMMQ to propose adjusting the transfer factor for income inequality rather than considering how the policy might have been designed to address equity. In most cases, current regulatory impact analyses have used non-economic models, such as air diffusion models, to define the groups affected by a proposed policy. In the early benefit cost analyses the proposed interventions were usually either water or highway projects. The projects identified the regions affected and then assumed the primary source of benefits would be due to use related services affected by them.

Eco-certifications put sustainability restrictions on the operations of those concessions. For spatially detailed data, including many pre-treatment years, we use new difference-in-differences estimators to estimate 2002–2018 impacts upon Peruvian Amazon forests from both logging concessions and their eco-certifications. We find that the concessions − which in theory could raise or reduce forest loss − did not raise loss, if anything reducing it slightly by warding off spikes in deforestation pressure. Eco-certifications could reduce or raise forest loss, yet we find no significant impacts.","Forest losses due to productive activities are a challenge to sustainable development, especially in developing countries with many poor citizens on forest frontiers. In the tropics, losses of local and global forest public goods result from ranching, agriculture, mining, and logging (Laurance et al., 2001; DeFries et al., 2010). Unlike in temperate zones, where forest regrew on net in 1990–2015, for tropical forests 129 million hectares were lost in that time (FAO 2016). Deforestation contributed about 15% of global carbon emissions and consequences included erosion, extinctions, and water-quality degradation (Wright and Muller-Landau 2006; van der Werf et al., 2009). Protected areas (PAs), which restrict some or all economic activities, have been the leading conservation response. PAs have reduced forest loss on average. However, their impacts have varied considerably across locations, and PA types, and in some cases PAs have had no short-run effects (Andam et al., 2008; Joppa and Pfaff, 2011; Pfaff et al., 2015; Herrera et al. 2019; Börner et al., 2020).====Since governments often promote economic activity, which PAs restrict, here we focus on forest impacts from the promotion of regulated timber extraction, in logging concessions. Firms granted medium-to long-term logging rights can earn revenues from timber harvests, while states raise revenue through extraction fees. In principle, rights can balance economic development with forest conservation, and such regulated timber activities have risen in popularity. Concessions now cover over 123 million hectares within the tropics − an area around the size of South Africa (Hensbergen 2018). Yet behaviors under logging rights within these concessions are not always well regulated. Weak monitoring and enforcement have led to forest-management certifications run by non-state actors (Auld et al. 2008). The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) offers a well-known third-party certification option, with 231 million hectares certified in 89 countries (FSC 2022b). The FSC audits concessions' practices to ensure that certified concessions comply with all applicable laws, in addition to FSC's own ecological and social standards (FSC 2022a).====We study impacts of logging concessions and FSC certifications on forest loss. We note that even the direction of concessions' impacts is theoretically ambiguous. Rights holders may defend their forest assets and reduce forest losses by preventing others from harvesting. Yet, instead, they may raise forest loss by violating concessions' terms. At the concession level, the sign of certifications' impacts is not ambiguous, since meeting sustainable-management standards does not harm forests. However, FSC can fail to improve forest outcomes if standards are not binding, such as when most of the firms that adopt certification already were meeting the FSC's standards. Certification could raise forest loss at the firm level if advertising existing sustainable practices achieves firms' goals of increasing demand and output − which can occur even if the FSC prevents deceptive advertising that lets firms sell uncertified timber that consumers perceive to be certified, i.e., ‘greenwashing’. The importance of logging concessions and certifications in forest management around the world, as well as these ambiguities regarding the direction of impacts, motivate our empirical assessment.====To estimate the impacts upon loss of forests due to logging concessions, as well as the addition of FSC certifications, we compile spatially detailed panel data. Given newly available long data sets, we can study 1986–2018 annual forest loss both inside and outside of logging concessions in Peru's Amazonian region. Peru's Amazon is the world's fourth-largest area of tropical forest, a hotspot for biodiversity, watersheds, and carbon storage (Ministerio del Ambiente, 2015), as well as Peru's dominant timber region. The state auctioned off most logging concessions between 2002 and 2004, for relatively isolated and sparsely populated regions with few private rights before concessions. Concession enforcement was limited, however, which helps to motivate third-party certification. For instance, starting in 2006, the FSC certified practices in some of these logging concessions.====We employ improvements not only in forest data but also in econometric models using panel data. A longer time series for forests provides more pre-treatment years. This supports our applications of new difference-in-differences (DID) estimators that solve key problems identified in two-way fixed effects (TWFE) estimators, which are widely utilized for policy evaluations with panel data.====It is worth highlighting three benefits from these advances. First, this new DID literature describes TWFE estimators as weighted sums of group-period average treatment effects (ATE), finding that some group-period ‘impact mini-estimates’ can receive negative weights which, in turn, can result in biased estimates if those ATEs are not all the same (de Chaisemartin and D’Haultfœuille, 2020). New DID estimators, in contrast, do not rely on homogeneous treatment effects for identification. Second, if TWFE regressions include multiple treatments − concessions and FSC for us − a TWFE estimator for the impact of one treatment can be ‘contaminated’ by other treatments' impacts (de Chaisemartin and D’Haultfœuille, 2022b). We employ de Chaisemartin and D'Haultfœuille, 2021, de Chaisemartin and D'Haultfœuille, 2022b estimators robust to having multiple treatments. Third, given the importance of the core identification assumption when using panel data − parallel trends − new DID estimators offer useful options for conducting formal tests of this condition. Along these lines, following advances in synthetic-cohort literatures (e.g. Arkhangelsky et al., 2021; Ben-Michael et al. 2021) we pre-match the treated units using pre-treatment forest loss. We also employ a continuous forest-loss outcome to avoid biases from using binary deforestation outcomes in panel data models (Garcia and Heilmayr 2022). Given all of those helpful advances by others, this empirical strategy could guide various evaluations of forest policy. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to estimate forest impacts of uncertified concessions and FSC certification using: (i) DID estimators robust to heterogeneity and contamination issues for TWFE (de Chaisemartin and D'Haultfœuille, 2020, de Chaisemartin and D'Haultfœuille, 2022b); as well as (ii) a considerably longer panel, for better tests concerning parallel trends.====We find no rise in forest loss due to the granting of logging rights within these forest concessions. If anything, concessions might ward off upward spikes in external deforestation pressure to slightly reduce forest loss − much like stricter PAs, though achieving a bit less than less strict multiple-use PAs which allow limited smallholder activities (we compare with analyses using the same data in Rico-Straffon, Wang, and Pfaff, 2022). We also find that FSC certification of logging-concessions’ practices provided no additional reductions of forest loss, relative to these uncertified concessions.====Our quasi-experimental results concerning Peru's logging concessions==== are consistent with limited prior studies, which find either forest-loss reductions or no effects upon forests due to concessions and community-managed forests (Fortmann et al. 2017; Panlasigui et al., 2018; Tritsch et al., 2020; Blackman and Villalobos 2021). Peru's concessions stand out in terms of their context, one in which logging is informal and hard to regulate (Sears and Pinedo-Vasquez 2011). We also add to a sparse quasi-experimental literature on certifications of supply chains − a growing issue in climate change, since huge shares of greenhouse emissions arise within value chains. Our finding of insignificant reductions for FSC is consistent with evidence ranging from null impacts to loss reductions (Miteva et al. 2015; Heilmayr and Lambin 2016; Blackman et al. 2018; Komives et al., 2018; Panlasigui et al., 2018; Rana and Sills 2018; Villalobos et al. 2018; Anderson et al. 2019; Tritsch et al., 2020).====The rest of the paper is as follows.

We find that hurricanes cause a temporary increase in home prices and a concurrent decrease in transactions, which together imply a negative transitory shock to the housing supply. Using ==== application data, we find that incoming homeowners in this period have higher incomes, leading to an overall shift toward wealthier groups. Our findings suggest that market responses to natural disasters can lead to uneven and lasting demographic changes in affected communities, even with a full recovery in physical capital.","An average of three hurricanes make landfall in the United States each year, typically concentrated along the Gulf and east coasts. These storms are characterized by strong winds and heavy rainfall that can generate substantial damage to physical infrastructure. The frequency and intensity of hurricanes, which are fueled by warm ocean temperatures in the tropics, are forecasted to increase substantially under climate change, along with the economic damage that accompany them.====While the initial damage from hurricanes is physical, they can lead to a wide range of behavioral and market responses that shape local economic equilibria, such as changes in disaster risk perceptions, migration, and employment opportunities, among others.==== In this paper, we study the housing market responses to all hurricanes that make landfall in Florida between 2000 and 2016. Two features of our research design are substantively different from past studies. First, we examine all storms to assess the impacts of more typical storms, rather than a single extreme storm such as Hurricane Katrina.==== Our findings are thus not complicated by government capacity shortages, rebuilding bottlenecks, philanthropic investments, and foreclosure moratoria that generally accompany severe events, or confined within the unique economic, cultural, and demographic context in one disaster area, such as pre-Katrina New Orleans (Vigdor, 2008). Second, we exploit an identification strategy that better captures general equilibrium effects. These are especially important since hurricanes are likely to impact housing supply as a result of destruction as well as housing demand as homeowners and businesses may learn more about risks in a particular location.====Our rich transaction-level data also allow us to examine the implications of these adjustments on local demographics. Even if price effects are transient, changes in the composition of neighborhoods can have long-lasting impacts by altering the distribution of rents associated with access to local economic opportunities and amenities (Kling et al., 2005, Kling et al., 2007, Chetty et al., 2016). This paper is among the only existing studies to present micro-evidence directly linking demographic changes to home transactions in response to local disaster shocks in a general equilibrium setting.====Our analysis is based on hurricane data from the National Oceanic and Oceanographic Association (NOAA) along with a detailed housing dataset that combines transaction records and county tax assessments. The transaction data include 95% of all housing transactions within the State of Florida. The repeated tax assessments over time provide rich information on hedonic characteristics for each parcel, thereby allowing us to infer characteristics of transacted homes with a high level of accuracy. These data allow us to identify and track individual parcels over time, as we observe most transactions and major renovations that took place between 2000 and 2016.====Our estimation strategy is unique in the literature, combining a staggered difference-in-differences framework that exploits the randomness in the paths and timing of hurricanes with a repeat sales model that ensures credible identification of within-home price changes. Treatment for an individual parcel is defined as being exposed to hurricane-strength wind speed, independent of damage to that particular parcel. We find that home prices ==== in exposed areas in the three years following a hurricane. Compared to unexposed areas, home prices in exposed areas are 5% higher on average during this period, with a peak of 10% in the second year. This effect is identified in two models. The first uses variation within census tract while controlling for property characteristics, seasonality, and differential economic growth across counties. The second model employs parcel fixed effects and therefore restricts the identifying variation to result from repeated sales of the same property. The estimates are very similar across the two models, providing strong evidence that the price effect is mainly driven by within-home appreciation rather than a shift in the composition of transacted homes.====We also find that the transaction probability of homes in exposed areas ==== by 0.7 percentage points or 7% of the baseline probability. The timing of this quantity effect is similar to that of the price effect: both last around three years before returning to the baseline. Taken together, they suggest that the housing markets within exposed areas experience a temporary negative supply shock. The duration of this effect is consistent with the time it takes for hurricane victims to seek financial aid from insurance companies or federal agencies, and to eventually restore any substantially damaged homes to habitable or sellable conditions.====While the adjustment in the market equilibrium appears to be transitory, our analysis suggests that it generates lasting impacts on the demographics of homeowners. Using the subset of our housing transactions that can be matched to Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) records, we show that the average income of new buyers increases nearly proportionally to the rise in home prices.==== In subsequent years, transacted prices and buyer incomes return to baseline levels but not below, yielding a long-term stock effect whereby more than a quarter of homes are occupied by households with a higher income than before the hurricane arrived. On the other hand, we do not find any major changes to the racial, ethnic, or gender profiles of buyers, suggesting that the socio-demographic characteristics of neighborhoods are quite stable in the face of these housing market shocks. The distributional impacts we measure are of direct relevance to any assessments of the equity impacts of hurricanes, and they provide a unique opportunity to explore the implications of gentrification in a causal framework.====These findings contribute to our understanding of housing market responses to disasters. Most of the literature studying the impact of disasters on home prices has focused on estimating how risk is capitalized (Bin and Polasky, 2004, Hallstrom and Smith, 2005, Daniel et al., 2009, Kousky, 2010, Atreya et al., 2013, Atreya and Ferreira, 2015, Bin and Landry, 2013, Ortega and Taspınar, 2018, Bakkensen et al., 2019, Beltrán et al., 2019, Gibson and Mullins, 2020). This paper, in contrast, captures the general equilibrium effects from both the demand and supply-side responses to hurricanes. Specifically, while the hedonic literature shows that housing demand generally decreases following a hurricane due to greater perceived risk, our results show that this shift in housing demand is dominated by a temporary decrease in housing supply due to the destruction of the housing stock.====Our finding on housing price adjustments is most similar to Murphy and Strobl (2010) in interpretation, who estimate a two-equation model of hurricane impacts on income and housing prices using CBSA-level data. While they also find a transitory increase in prices, our use of dis-aggregated demographics data further reveal, for the first time, changes in buyer income associated with housing turnover following a hurricane. The post-disaster market might select for wealthier buyers as they have a greater ability to both absorb the price increase and any ensuing insurance cost increases. As discussed in Kuminoff and Pope (2014), the marginal willingness-to-pay for amenities cannot be reliably recovered from price changes if the hedonic equilibrium adjustment results from, for example, changes in the mix of home buyers and their preferences. Our findings of a dominant supply response and the associated change in demographics thus provide an important caveat in the use of such shocks to back out preferences for avoiding disaster risks.====This paper is also closely related to the growing literature that examines the impacts of wars and disasters on local economic activity through the destruction of capital and infrastructure (Ikle, 1951, Davis and Weinstein, 2002, Miguel and Roland, 2011, Gignoux and Menéndez, 2016, Feigenbaum et al., 2022). In general, these studies find that cities were able to recover quickly from such destruction, even in the case of flooding where the event carries risk signals (Kocornik-Mina et al., 2020). Consistent with these findings, we also see a lack of longer-term response in local housing markets, which raises questions about institutional and behavioral barriers in the housing market that might prevent its participants to fully process and respond to risk information (Bakkensen and Barrage, 2021, Keys and Mulder, 2020, Ouazad and Kahn, 2021).====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

Using difference-in-differences we estimate the impacts of ,"While an increasing literature addresses the links between institutions and the environment, both theoretically (Fredriksson and Svensson, 2003, Harstad and Mideksa, 2017) and empirically (Bohn and Deacon, 2000, Farzin and Bond, 2006, Burgess et al., 2012), the relationship between institutions and the establishment of protected areas (PAs) has received little attention so far (Hu et al., 2020). This constitutes an important issue since PAs cover about 15% of terrestrial surface and are recognized as a key tool for natural resources conservation (Maxwell et al., 2020).====In this paper, we use difference-in-differences to estimate how institutions, proxied by a dichotomous index of democracy, impact the establishment of terrestrial PAs. We unfold two main results related to the size and strictness of established PAs. First, we find that democratizers devote higher shares of land to PAs. Our preferred estimates indicate that, fifteen years after democratization, the share of the countries’ area under PAs increases on average by one percentage point (p.p.) more than what would have been established without democratization. Second, we find that democratizers implement the different types of PAs in a non-homogeneous way. Some democratization events are for example associated to a double of the initial share of the countries’ area under “wilderness areas” (i.e. large natural reserves), one of the most stringent types of PAs. Others have only significant impacts on the least stringent PA types. Crucially, most of those results are only statistically significant eight to twenty years after democratization, suggesting that institutions affect natural resources conservation mainly in the medium- and long-run.====To reach these results, we build a panel dataset of 144 countries over the 1992–2018 period, which covers the establishment of 68% of all terrestrial PAs. Our primary data source is the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) that provides exhaustive information on PAs worldwide. We measure institutional quality across countries with a democracy index combining Polity5 and Freedom House scores (Papaioannou and Siourounis, 2008, Acemoglu et al., 2019). We then estimate the treatment effects of first democratization event on the size and strictness of PAs using the DID==== estimator proposed by De Chaisemartin and D’Haultfoeuille (2022a). In addition to be robust to heterogeneous and dynamic treatment effects, the DID==== estimator is particularly adapted to our “unstaggered” setting where countries can switch “in” and “out” democracy. Importantly, we show that our results are robust to alternative estimators, specifications and treatment definitions.====Our analysis contributes to the literature by being the first global-level analysis with an identification strategy that isolates the effect of institutions on PA establishment. Indeed, existing works rely on cross-section regressions (Midlarsky, 1998, Neumayer, 2002, Van, 2003, Wurster, 2013, Kashwan, 2017), where several biases prevent causal identification.==== By comparison, we are using the latest developments in the difference-in-differences literature to ensure unbiased measures of the impacts of institutions on PA establishment. Specifically, we are among the first to use the De Chaisemartin and D’Haultfoeuille (2022a)’s estimator to an applied research question. Given that our estimates are robust to several empirical choices, we believe that they plausibly represent causal impacts of institutions on PA establishment. Our work is also related to a large literature focusing on PA effectiveness (e.g., Joppa et al., 2008), particularly regarding the role of institutions (Abman, 2018, Bonilla-Mejía and Higuera-Mendieta, 2019). We view our analysis as complementary to those as we focus on establishment rather than effectiveness. Finally, we contribute to the larger literature on institutions and natural resources conservation, where policy implementation has been overlooked (Dasgupta and De Cian, 2018).====The paper is structured as follows.

In a first-best setting, the optimal use of CDR is achieved by a removal subsidy that equals the optimal carbon tax and marginal damages. We derive second-best policy rules for CDR subsidies and carbon taxes when no global carbon price exists but a national government implements a unilateral climate policy. We find that the optimal carbon tax differs from an optimal CDR subsidy because of carbon leakage and a balance of resource trade effect. First, the optimal removal subsidy tends to be larger than the carbon tax because of lower supply-side leakage on fossil resource markets. Second, net carbon exporters exacerbate this wedge to increase producer surplus of their carbon resource producers, implying even larger removal subsidies. Third, net carbon importers may set their removal subsidy even below their carbon tax when marginal environmental damages are small, to appropriate producer surplus from carbon exporters.","Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) refers to a set of technologies that remove CO==== from the atmosphere and store it in geological, terrestrial, or ocean reservoirs, or in products. While CDR is not employed at large scale today, the technology is projected to play a substantial role in achieving the Paris climate targets (IPCC, 2018). An extensive literature has investigated its potentials, costs and side effects (Minx et al., 2018, Fuss et al., 2018, Nemet et al., 2018), but research into efficient governance of CDR is in its infancy (but cf. Lemoine, 2020, Groom and Venmans, 2021, Kalkuhl et al., 2022).====If removed carbon can be stored permanently, then reducing CO==== emissions and employing CDR are two mitigation options that have the same effect on CO==== in the atmosphere. Both can be incentivized by carbon pricing. Under idealized conditions, cost–benefit analysis mandates both prices to be equal to the social cost of carbon. However, the general optimality condition may not hold in second-best settings such as unilateral carbon pricing in an international context as explored in this paper.====In this paper, we reveal an asymmetry between carbon taxes and CDR subsidies for the case of supply-side carbon leakage and strategic appropriation of the surplus of resource producers. Carbon leakage refers to global emission responses to unilateral emissions reductions. There are three commonly distinguished channels (following Jakob et al., 2014): free-rider leakage, that is, increased emissions in response to reduced climate change damages (as in Hoel 1991), supply-side leakage, which occurs through increased fossil energy demand in response to falling international energy prices (as in Bohm, 1993, Gerlagh and Kuik, 2014), and specialization leakage, which describes the relocation of emission-intensive production (as in Siebert 1979). Our analysis focuses on the first two channels but we discuss implications for other channels when we conclude.====We use a static model with two regions that are linked by an international fossil energy market and climate change damages. Only one of the two regions implements climate policy in the form of unilateral carbon pricing. We derive optimal solutions for emissions reduction and emissions removal for this region in anticipation of carbon leakage to the second region.====We find that ==== a ton of CO==== from the atmosphere unilaterally by one region causes less leakage than ==== CO==== emissions by a ton. This is because, in contrast to emissions reduction, carbon removal does not cause supply-side leakage. Therefore, the optimal CDR subsidy tends to be higher than the optimal tax but lower than marginal climate damages. Additionally, a country may exploit its market power on the global resource market to change fossil energy price in its favor, depending on the net trade balance. This motive leads to another strategic wedge between the optimal carbon tax and the optimal carbon removal subsidy. In certain cases, the difference between optimal carbon tax and CDR subsidy can be expressed as a simple function of the supply side leakage rate. This paper is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to explore the leakage implications of carbon removal policies in a stylized analytical model (but cf. Quirion et al. 2011 who explore a similar argument for the use of carbon capture and sequestration with fossil fuel combustion in a numerical model).",Optimal pricing for carbon dioxide removal under inter-regional leakage,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009506962200122X,12 December 2022,2022,Research Article,36.0

During the 2011–2015 period, less than 20% of the population in OECD and high-income countries were exposed to annual mean concentrations above the WHO guideline of 10 μg per cubic meter of air (μg/m====), while more than 90% of the population in low-and-middle income countries faced pollution above the WHO guidelines. Studies show that air pollution generated substantial health costs in developing nations: half of premature deaths in the world attributed to air pollution are from China and India alone (Lancet Commission, 2016).====Studies of the causal impact of air pollution on health often take place using areas with comparatively low levels of air pollution (e.g., OECD countries).==== This paper aims to better understand the health and pollution relationship in more polluted environments. We examine the causal impact of long-term exposure to PM==== on mortality in China, where the annual concentration of PM==== was consistently over 50 μg/m====.==== We use a panel data set of the 161 county and city-districts covered by the Disease Surveillance Point System (DSPS) of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for the years of 2004, 2008, and 2010. We combine this with satellite measures of estimated long-term average PM==== exposure levels.====In estimating the long-term mortality impact of air pollution, we need to deal with the key identification challenge that economic growth drives both higher pollution levels and health care improvements, especially in rapidly developing nations. To address this potential endogeneity, we construct an instrumental variable (IV) for PM==== in which we leverage the severe global economic recession in the late 2000s. The global decrease in demand for China-produced manufactured goods generated shocks to demand for Chinese exports. We propagate these global shocks to the local level using variation in export destinations and wind patterns across Chinese prefectures (i.e., cities). Our identifying assumption is that the global economic recession affected prefectures in China differently due to cross-regional differences in exposure to trade, both in terms of total share of economic production and dependence on different export destinations which were affected differentially by the global economic crisis. To further address concerns of bias from local economic effects, we instrument for pollution levels in a given county using shocks from ==== areas, employing information on prevailing wind direction in the region. Our IV thus uses local variation in three factors for a given county: (1) the (pre-determined) size of the export sector of nearby prefectures, (2) primary destinations for exports from nearby prefectures, and (3) prevailing wind direction bringing pollution from nearby prefectures.====An additional empirical challenge lies in the lack of reliable pollution measurements in developing nations. This means an increased likelihood of measurement error in region-specific pollution exposure, or biases driven by misreporting (Ghanem and Zhang, 2014; Greenstone et al., 2019). During the period of our mortality data, there were no reliable ground-level PM==== monitoring data in China, which became available starting in 2013 at the national level (Barwick et al., 2019). Instead, we use three-year average PM==== levels derived from satellite data on measurements of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD). Due to its advantage in rich spatial coverage, satellite-based pollution data have been used in many recent studies (e.g., van Donkelaar et al., 2015; Zou, 2021; Greenstone et al., 2021).====By leveraging air pollution variation induced by the trade shocks due to notably the global financial crisis of 2007–2008, we find long-term, regular exposure to PM====, as measured by three-year averaged pollution levels, increases all-cause and cardiorespiratory mortality in an economically and statistically significant manner. The largest impacts are for those 65 years and older, which foretells of a rising future disease burden given a growing older population in China. Using PM==== variation in both location and time within China, we examine the pollution dose-response function across higher and lower levels of ambient pollution. We find larger marginal mortality impacts at lower concentrations, indicating a concave dose-response function. This aligns with recent findings that air quality improvements may result in only “modest reductions in burden in the most polluted countries unless PM==== concentrations decline markedly” (Cohen et al., 2017). It also highlights the potential complications of extrapolating marginal effects of pollution to more heavily polluted areas using studies in low-pollution nations.====Our results align with the growing body of literature showing that higher levels of ambient air pollution increase mortality.==== China's higher pollution levels make our estimates most closely comparable to Chen et al. (2013), He et al. (2016) and Ebenstein et al. (2017), all of which study pollution and mortality in China. We both build on and add to these earlier findings in three ways. First, Chen et al. (2013) estimate the impact of total suspended particulates (TSP), and He et al. (2016) and Ebenstein et al. (2017) examine particulate matter smaller than ten microns (PM====). We estimate the impact of PM==== on mortality, as health literature suggests finer particles such as PM==== carry larger adverse health impacts because they may be more toxic, can penetrate deeper into lungs, and remain suspended for longer period of time than larger particles (Pope and Dockery, 2006).====Second, we offer an alternative identification strategy. Both Chen et al. (2013) and Ebenstein et al. (2017) focus on pollution's long-term impact by using a regression discontinuity (RD) approach based on the Huai River heating policy in China, which relies on purely cross-sectional variation in air pollution due to differences in central heating policy across the Huai River. Our approach uses both spatial and temporal variation. He et al. (2016) estimate the short-term impact based on the shock to air pollution due to the singular event of the Olympic games in Beijing in 2008, which is informative but cannot speak to longer-run exposure.====Third, we examine the shape of the dose-response function by considering effects above and below the median PM==== levels in China (42 μg/m====) during our study period. Different parts of China experienced wide variation in average ambient pollution levels (rather than one-time extreme shocks), which is a key factor that allows us to jointly estimate marginal effects at both lower and higher levels of pollution using a knotted spline.====Section 2 of this paper provides background on China's air pollution challenge, describes our various data sources, and explains the design of our IV strategy.

Using evidence from California, we find loans more likely to be denied or sold after increased NNDEs. Banks with fewer assets, more diversified branching markets, or stronger sales capability relied more on ","Understanding how economic agents update risk perception is important in promoting efficient disaster risk mitigation and adaptation. Existing studies find that homeowners could learn from recent floods to update their risk perception of future floods (Kousky, 2010; Gallagher, 2014). Banks also learned from billion-dollar hurricane events and originated more conforming mortgage loans to be sold to the Government-Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) in response (Ouazad and Kahn, 2022). Moreover, disasters affect the risk perception of homeowners even when physical damage was negligible (Liu et al., 2018), when no dis-amenity effects occurred (McCoy and Walsh, 2018), and when the events were geographically distant (Muller and Hopkins, 2019). It is unknown, however, whether banks also take precautionary measures in response to disasters that send risk signals but do not cause actual losses. Banks' disaster risk management deserves research and policy attention because of their critical role in promoting economic growth and disaster resilience as financial institutions. This study uses noticeable non-damaging earthquakes (“NNDEs”) to examine how banks react to the risk information of seismic shocks independent of financial losses.====Earthquakes subject banks to losses such as collateral depreciation and foreclosure expenses when borrowers default on damaged properties (Anderson and Weinrobe, 1986). However, unlike flood insurance, earthquake insurance is not required to cover loans secured by buildings in seismic zones, leading to a low take-up rate of about 10 percent (Marshall, 2017). Moreover, banks are more vulnerable to uninsured seismic risk in non-recourse states like California, where banks are prohibited from suing borrowers to make up the difference between the collateral value and the outstanding balance in the event of foreclosure. Our study exploits NNDEs in California as costless risk signals that convey the salience of seismic risk but do not cause property damage. We examine changes in banks' credit decisions on home mortgage loans after NNDEs to reveal their risk perception updating process and the associated risk management strategies.====When perceiving seismic risk, banks are expected to reevaluate the risk of default and collateral devaluation for loans in the affected neighborhoods. The increased anticipated credit losses may lead to reduced loan provisions (Garmaise and Moskowitz, 2009; Berg and Schrader, 2012; Xu and Xu, 2020). Alternatively, banks may choose to charge higher interest rates to price the risk (Garmaise and Moskowitz, 2009) or securitize more to transfer the risk of the originated loans (Xu and Xu, 2020; Ouazad and Kahn, 2022). In particular, the major buyers in the secondary market, i.e., the GSEs, lack local disaster information. Banks are thus more likely to exploit the information asymmetry to shift the risk. In this study, we develop a theoretical model that allows a bank to make an adjustment in the probability of future damaging earthquakes on top of the existing knowledge after NNDEs. The model explicitly disentangles two channels of potential financial losses, i.e., default risk and collateral devaluation, and three risk management strategies, i.e., loan denial, interest rate adjustment, and securitization. Our model concludes that banks perceiving seismic risk do not necessarily cut the loan supply if they can use the pricing and securitization tools to manage the risk. We then empirically examine banks' responses to seismic shocks using 2010–2016 California home mortgage loans from the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data. In our loan-level analysis, we measure seismic shocks by the within-Census-tract variations in the number of NNDEs in the previous year. Our model captures time-invariant Census-tract-level characteristics by controlling for the Census tract fixed effects and the county-level loan demand changes by controlling for the bank by year by county fixed effects.====The baseline results show increases in the likelihoods of a loan being denied or sold after NNDEs. Given one more NNDE in the previous year, the likelihood of a loan being denied increased by 0.1 percentage points (p-value<0.05), equivalent to a 0.7 percent increase in the loan denial rate. The results indicate that the perceived risk from NNDEs led to a credit supply cut of a small magnitude. By comparison, Garmaise and Moskowitz (2009) find that the presence of objective earthquake risk, measured by the associated annual loss, could reduce the probability of bank loan provision in California by 12.4 percentage points, equivalent to a 22 percent of the mean probability. Meanwhile, we find that one more NNDE in the previous year raised the likelihood of a loan being sold to the GSEs by 0.3 percentage points (p-value<0.05), or a 0.6 percent increase in the rate of GSEs securitization. The adjustment in loan securitization was more pronounced among banks with fewer assets, more diversified branching markets, or stronger connections with the secondary market. As we further explore two alternative measures of seismic shocks, our evidence suggests that banks' decisions on loan denial were more responsive to the shaking intensity of earthquakes, whereas their decisions on loan securitization relied more on the concentration of seismic activity. Our findings of banks' ==== precautionary behavior when no damage costs occur expand the existing literature on banks' ==== strategies to recover from damaging disasters, such as capital reallocation across markets (Cortés and Strahan, 2017), relationship-based lending (Berg and Schrader, 2012; Koetter et al., 2019), and asset portfolio adjustment (Schüwer et al., 2018; Bos et al., 2022). In particular, we add to Ouazad and Kahn (2022) by showing that banks could respond to the disaster risk information ==== in non-damaging disasters even when the market conditions and loan quality were unaffected.====Next, we explore the potential channels from which banks could source seismic information. We show that banks likely sourced seismic information from both personal experience and soft information such as real-time local news. Specifically, banks did not respond to unnoticeable earthquakes but reacted to noticeable ones only and especially to those in their branching markets. They also responded to earthquakes in neighboring counties within the same media network. Our findings indicate that banks can use local soft information to detect environmental risks, which are linked to the broader literature on bank branching and relationship-based lending (Ergungor, 2010; Berg and Schrader, 2012; Gilje et al., 2016; Koetter et al., 2019).====We then examine how banks update their risk perception after NNDEs. We find that banks only responded to NNDEs up to the past three years, which might be explained by the availability bias (Tversky and Kahneman, 1973, 1974) or a Bayesian learning process that heavily discounts the past information (Gallagher, 2014). Meanwhile, we find no changes in the observable default risk or immediate collateral devaluation. Specifically, we find no evidence of sorting by less creditworthy borrowers into neighborhoods exposed to NNDEs. In addition, we only identify a moderate and temporary housing price drop that persisted nine months after NNDEs, which barely imposed credit risks unless collaterals were forced to be sold due to foreclosure before housing prices rebounded. However, the risk is extremely low given that foreclosure within one year of loan origination is rare even during the global financial crisis (Xu, 2014). Moreover, homeowners are unlikely to walk away from such a moderate collateral devaluation, especially when the housing price fluctuation period is even shorter than the typical foreclosure timeline (Cordell et al., 2015). Thus, banks' responses to NNDEs were more likely to result from the concern about an increased chance of damaging earthquakes during the mortgage term.",Do non-damaging earthquakes shake mortgage lenders' risk perception?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069622001139,14 November 2022,2022,Research Article,38.0

Accordingly, individuals change behavior spatially and/or temporally in response to external shocks, regulations, and incentives. For example, commuters adjust their departure time according to different toll regimes (Arnott et al., 1993). When facing spatial closures, fishers substitute fishing locations to seek economic returns (Smith and Wilen, 2003). Recreationists change the location and time of beach visits due to temporary closures of beaches caused by oil spills (English et al., 2018; Glasgow and Train, 2018). In these cases, understanding how individuals choose location and time and substitute activities spatially and temporally, is important for predicting demand (e.g., restaurants, recreation) and evaluating the effectiveness of policy tools (e.g., regulations or incentives).====When participating in activities (e.g., outdoor recreation activities) to benefit from the natural environment, individuals choose locations and time periods of these activities (e.g., where and when to hike) to maximize utility. At the same time, policy makers can provide incentives to induce behavioral changes for improving environmental conditions (e.g., protect wildlife populations). These behavioral changes may come at a cost to individuals. As a result, individuals' decisions reflect trade-offs among improved environment, incentives, and private cost. Environmental economists have widely studied individuals' spatial decisions in response to changes in environmental conditions (e.g., wildfires in Nobel et al., 2020, harmful algal blooms in Wolf et al., 2019) with relatively few studies have focused on individuals’ temporal decisions or both temporal and spatial decisions. Moreover, economists and policy makers have largely examined the behavioral and welfare impacts of material incentives (e.g., financial incentives to increase the purchase of energy-efficient vehicles in Clinton and Steinberg, 2019). Yet few studies have discussed the impact of incentives that do not offer direct monetary value but allow for a more flexible time period of activities (e.g., a year round fishing season in Abbott et al., 2018, flexible working time in Eriksson and Kristensen, 2014).====In this study, we examine how individuals make spatial and temporal decisions in response to the provision of non-monetary incentives associated with time choices in the context of recreational activities. We extend a discrete-continuous (often called the Kuhn-Tucker, KT) recreation demand model in a multiple discrete-continuous extreme value specification, with a focus on spatial and temporal substitution behavior in recreation trips, as well as the welfare benefits from the incentives involving time choices, which are seldom discussed in recreation demand models (Freeman et al., 2014). Building on previous work that focuses on the temporal dimension in KT recreation demand models (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2019, 2020), the proposed model in this study captures both spatial ==== temporal choices by recasting choice sets from alternative locations or time periods to alternative locations in each time period, at extensive and intensive margins.====The empirical application of the model is used to study recreational hunters' behavioral responses to the presence of a wildlife disease (Chronic Wasting Disease, CWD) and the season expansion program for disease management. CWD is an infectious wildlife disease that imposes risks to wildlife populations and affects recreational and wildlife harvesting activities, especially in places where recreationists harvest animals for meat consumption. Given its various transmission routes, lack of vaccinations and treatments, increasing hunter harvest in CWD-infected areas has been considered as an effective and publicly accepted option to control CWD (Pattison-Williams et al., 2020). Although extending hunting seasons based on animal activities has been proposed as an incentive program to increase and direct hunter harvest in disease-infected areas, the impacts of season expansion programs on recreation hunting activity and economic value are not well examined and understood. In this study, we advance the understanding of recreational hunters’ behavior and welfare benefits of season expansion programs by estimating our proposed model with the data from a revealed and stated preference survey of recreational hunters in Alberta, Canada.====Our results show that individuals change recreation location and time when they receive the incentive of the season expansions. We find spatial and temporal substitution behavior caused by the incentives and this behavior is not captured if only the spatial or temporal dimension is examined. An extended season is an effective incentive to engage recreational hunters for disease management because it increases hunting trips and generates welfare benefits for individuals. Also, we find that the wildlife disease does not appear to affect individuals’ behavior which increases the merit of the season expansions as a wildlife conservation policy tool. In general, the findings in this study suggest incentives that increase the flexibility for individuals to choose the time of activities are effective in encouraging beneficial outcomes when these activities involve location and time.====This study makes two contributions to the environmental valuation and general economics literature. First, from a methodological perspective, this study develops a flexible econometric model to capture individuals' choice behavior by explicitly incorporating spatial and temporal decisions in a demand system. Different from previous studies that mostly capture one dimension of individual decision making (e.g., spatial or temporal choices), the proposed model in this study captures spatial ==== temporal dimensions. As such, this study presents a better behaviorally consistent model for demand estimation of individual behavior. The associated welfare measures also derive more accurate values of the natural environment. Second, from conceptual and policy perspectives, this study provides insights into the use of non-monetary incentives associated with time choices. Compared to the majority of economics research that examines material incentives (e.g., financial rewards, commodities) that could be converted into monetary values, in this study, we discuss a unique type of incentive: the incentive that offers time flexibility for individuals to increase utility. For individuals, this type of incentive could increase welfare by increasing the choice set in the temporal dimension (e.g., relaxing working and shopping time constraints). For incentive providers such as policy makers or private companies, this type of incentive could be effective in achieving desirable outcomes at a relatively low cost. For example, companies could increase employees’ productivity by adding working-time flexibility arrangements without increasing incentive pay (Eriksson and Kristensen, 2014).====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief review of relevant literature in recreation demand models and welfare measures. Section 3 describes the conceptual model and empirical estimation. Section 4 introduces the background of empirical application. Section 5 describes the data used for the empirical analysis.

Exploiting this as a quasi-natural experiment, we examine the effects of this cross-border regulatory change on ====, particularly managerial, for both Indian upstream (dye-producing) and downstream (leather and textile) firms. We find that the regulation increased compensation of managers by 1.3%–18% in dye-producing firms compared to other chemical firms. This is due to the combination of changes such as investing in R&D, product churning, import of high-quality intermediates, due to the ban, which led to this change in within-firm labor composition. This increase in overall compensation is driven only by fixed component (wages), consistent with the effects of a long-run shock. We find no such effects for downstream firms. We believe, our study is one of the first to show that just like tariff, non-tariff barriers (NTBs) can also significantly affect within-firm labor composition.","Understanding the effects of cross-border regulations on labor demand is increasingly becoming important given the continuous drop in tariffs (after the 1988 Uruguay Round negotiations) and rise in non-tariffs barriers consequently. While there is a vast array of literature on the effects of various forms of trade reforms (import competition, tariff drop, Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), etc.) on labor market adjustments (Revenga, 1992, Artuc et al., 2010, Autor et al., 2013, Dix-Carneiro, 2014, Chakraborty and Raveh, 2018), there is a dearth of evidence (both theoretical and empirical) on the effects of non-tariff barriers (NTBs, hereafter) despite the growing prevalence of NTBs in international trade.====For example, a 2002 study by the International Trade Commission (ITC) found that 40% of exports are subject to NTBs (UNCTAD, 2005). Recent technical reports by WTO (2012) and De Melo and Nicita (2018) also highlight that in the last few decades, use of NTBs has increased to support a wide range of development strategies, domestic priorities, policy objectives (including SDGs), etc.====Can a cross-border environmental regulation (or a NTB) influence labor choices within a firm? Environmental regulations (both domestic and foreign) often spur innovation (Jaffe and Palmer, 1997, Chakraborty and Chatterjee, 2017) and adoption of new technology (Gray and Shadbegian, 1998, Popp, 2002, Aghion et al., 2016) which, in turn, may lead to changes in production technologies and product portfolios at the firm level. Such changes require labor adjustments in terms of conceptualizing as well as undertaking research for new substitute inputs/products. Previous research on environmental regulations have shown sufficient evidence on firms adapting new strategies to comply with these regulations that has important implications for productivity (Gollop and Roberts, 1983, Berman and Bui, 2001a) and competitiveness (Lanoie et al., 2011, Rexhäuser and Rammer, 2014). However, there is a prominent gap in documenting and understanding the potential effects of such regulations on demand for managing such re-organizations (in terms of changes in the production process) within a firm.====The question of cross-border effects of regulatory changes on managerial inputs becomes even more important from the perspective of the extant literature on firms’ managerial practices, quality improvements, and organizational structure, and the corresponding implications for overall performance. For example, Bloom et al. (2013) show that differences in managerial practices can explain a substantial part of firm level productivity across Indian textile firms.====Adopting a quasi-natural experiment, in the form of a foreign regulatory change, in the context of India we study the effects of a NTB on managerial demand and compensation. To the best of our knowledge, our study constitutes one of the first to explore the effects of NTBs on such dimensions.====In July 1994, Germany banned a widely-used chemical dye known as “Azo-dyes” based on a petition filed by a consumer advocacy group due to health and environmental concerns.==== The ban primarily targeted any leather and textile product that is treated with Azo-dyes. Banning of this input (which is one of the oldest and widely used chemicals in the production of leather and textile goods) for downstream (or leather and textile) firms became a ==== ban for the producers of this particular input in India, i.e., the dye-producing firms within the Indian chemical industry.==== Utilizing a rich data set of Indian manufacturing firms that uniquely distinguishes between the compensation of managers and non-managers,==== we explore the impact of this plausibly exogenous environmental regulation on the demand for managers in the upstream dye-producing and downstream leather and textile firms. This allows us to trace out the spillover effects of a cross-border regulation in terms of firms’ labor demand through integrated global supply chain.====The emphasis on the upstream industry and their labor adjustments (in terms of demand for managers), is central to our analysis. The ban on Azo-dyes was an irreversible regulatory change and therefore could potentially drive significant changes in terms of designing new product portfolios (e.g., changing their core product) and/or engage in research to innovate a new formidable substitute, altering the demand for managers as well as non-managers. As Garicano (2000) and Caliendo and Rossi-Hansberg (2012) argue, firms that need to solve new problems in terms of their production may need to upgrade the skills of the workers (or non-managers), while simultaneously reduce the cost of production by increasing the quality and number of managers who specialize in solving problems as well as in innovating. Hence, our empirical approach requires an examination of the effect of complementarity (or substitutability) arising out of the regulatory changes (which constitutes a product ban for the dye-makers) on the demand for managers relative to the demand for non-managers.====We start by presenting some descriptive evidence linking the cross-border regulatory change and the relative demand for managers in our sample of Indian chemical firms for the period of 1989–2002. ==== of Fig. 1 shows the managerial compensation as a share of total compensation for dye-producing firms (which are primarily affected by the regulation, therefore our treated group) and firms which produces other types of chemicals (our control group). The figure clearly shows that while there is no difference in the pre-ban period (in the period 1989–1993), there is a wide gap in the post-ban timeframe. ==== of Fig. 1 does the same, but for R&D expenditure of those firms. We see a similar picture here: no difference in the trends before the ban, but quite substantial change in the post-ban period.====We calculate a simple correlation between managerial compensation and R&D expenditure for dye-producing and other chemical firms. In the case of the former, the correlation coefficient is 0.76, whereas for the latter the same is 0.05. ==== ==== and ==== of Fig. 1 points toward a possible causal effect of the mentioned NTB on managerial compensation through a surge in R&D expenditure.====The key point in exploiting this particular event for causal inference is that the ban on Azo-dyes provides a plausible exogenous change in industry level dynamics, in our case for dye-producing firms (representing the ‘treatment’ group) relative to the rest of the chemical firms (representing the ‘control’ group). Using a difference-in-differences approach, we find a remarkably persistent and economically meaningful positive effect. In particular, our main finding is that the ban led to a significant increase in demand for managerial workers; around 2.2%–18% increase in the compensation of managers in dye-producing firms compared to other chemical firms. In terms of the share, it increased by about 1.3% for the dye-producing firms. Our benchmark finding is robust to all possible simultaneous events, such as drop in tariffs due to 1990s trade reforms, import of finished goods, raw materials, export growth, etc., different specifications, and alternate estimation techniques. Specifically, we rule out any industry- or firm-specific trends as causing the effect, such as a drop in input tariffs (Chakraborty and Raveh, 2018).====Examining the mechanisms which led to this observed increase in managerial compensation, we find that the ban forced the dye-producers to develop a new core product, improved and safe substitute to Azo-dyes. Now, developing a new core product or changing product portfolio requires conceptualization/ideas, R&D expenditure, new imported raw materials, creating sales partnerships, doing business development, among others.==== All these changes (in the production processes of a firm) could potentially create a new set of non-routine problems. And, in order to solve for them, a representative firm needs higher inputs from managers (relative to non-managers) that can solve these, and plan for the future, among other tasks. Combined, the value of the managers (both price and number) would increase significantly, which is what we find in our analyses.==== These patterns are primarily driven by the domestic private Indian firms producing intermediate goods (by end use) and firms’ across the size distribution except for the firms below the 25th percentile.====Digging deeper, we decompose the total managers’ compensation into its wages (fixed component) and incentives (variable component). We find that it is only the fixed component that increases as a response to the ban. This is consistent with the idea or literature by Ederer and Manso (2013) which argues that in response to long-term or permanent shock, it is the wage and not ‘pay-for-performance’ (or incentive) component that turns out to be important. All these changes for a dye-producing firm in the one hand led to decline in the profits, but increase in productivity on the other. Finally, we show that none of these effects (in terms of changes in the product portfolio or R&D expenses or increase in the value of managers, etc.) hold for downstream firms (which we use as a placebo/counterfactual).====We end our analysis by summarizing the main findings and discussing their implications in order to understand the impact of such kind of regulation in terms of technical change (Acemoglu, 2002). In particular, we interpret the main findings to be an outcome of changes in firms’ organization of knowledge (product portfolio and innovation), triggered by the NTB/regulation. Broadly, our evidence suggests that a firm may value managers more relative to non-managers if they face such kind of NTB, essentially because that may motivate a manager to innovate, reorganize tasks (in terms of changing their core versus non-core product portfolio), etc. This is our primary contribution.====This paper relates primarily to three different strands of literature. First and foremost, our main mechanism works through documenting the regulatory impacts of firm behavior. There is an overwhelmingly large volume of literature concerning non-tariff measures, both TBTs (Technical Barriers to Trade) and SPS (Sanitary and Phytosanitary), and its effect on different firm level attributes: (1) trade (especially exports) (Chen et al., 2008, Fontagné et al., 2015, Chakraborty, 2017, Fontagné and Orefice, 2018), (2) firm exit (Biorn et al., 1998), (3) innovation (R&D expenditure, patents) (Jaffe and Palmer, 1997, Berman and Bui, 2001a, Ambec et al., 2013), (4) technical change (Calel and Dechezleprêtre, 2016), (5) productivity (Perkins and Neumayer, 2012), (6) capital employed (Gray and Shadbegian, 1998, Nelson et al., 1993), (7) plant or establishment birth and size (Dean et al., 2000), (8) input reallocation (Vandenbussche and Viegelahn, 2018), (9) markups (Singh and Chanda, 2021), etc.====Overall, the evidence is mixed. Our paper deviates from this literature and looks at the effect of a foreign environmental regulation on the composition of labor within a firm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that focuses on a NTB or cross-border environmental regulation (which is exogenous in nature) and examine changes in labor demand within and between firms. Our study complements (Navaretti et al., 2020)==== and adds to this nascent literature by showing similar effects for Indian dye-producing firms but in response to a ban which was primarily directed to their downstream industries.====Second, the study also contributes to the overall literature on environmental regulations. Theoretically, the effect of environmental regulation on employment is uncertain (Bovenberg and van der Ploeg, 1996, Carraro et al., 1996, Schneider, 1997). On the one hand, environmental regulations could increase the costs of production through the use of new products and processes thereby reducing profits and labor demand. On the other, improving the production processes and using new technologies (to reduce environmental costs) would require labor input and that may promote employment.====Empirically, there exists a small literature which studies the employment effects of environmental regulations (Goodstein, 1995, Berman and Bui, 2001b, Cole and Elliott, 2007, Greenstone, 2002, Walker, 2013, Gray et al., 2014, Liu et al., 2017).==== However, all of these studies (i) overall employment changes (either at the national, regional, or plant level) rather than changes in worker composition within a firm, and (ii) exploit domestic regulation(s) which may be endogenous to the performance of firms. We, on the other hand, use a cross-border regulation and look at within-firm demand for managerial workers (relative to non-managerial workers).====Our study highlights one crucial point: organizations need to manage innovations and other auxiliary activities while simultaneously adapting to new developments in the market (Dessein and Santos, 2006, Alonso et al., 2015) in the form of regulation or otherwise. Since “management matters” to quote (Alexopoulos and Tombe, 2012),==== this activity is generally correlated with changes in the compensation structure of the managers. The interaction between technological change, management and resulting inequality is well-recognized in the literature (Galor and Moav, 2000, Garicano and Rossi-Hansberg, 2004, Gabaix and Landier, 2008, Berrone and Gomez-Mejia, 2009).====Finally, we note that there is nascent literature on understanding policy transmission through input–output network (Liu, 2019). This is different from propagation of macroeconomic shocks (e.g. as described in Baqaee and Farhi (2019)) and technology diffusion (Acemoglu et al., 2016, Basker and Simcoe, 2017). A parallel literature also deals with how competition and regulatory frictions in the product market interact with the propensity to innovate and contributes to the transmission of innovation (Nelson et al., 1993, Millimet et al., 2009, Sanyal and Ghosh, 2013, Eizenberg, 2014, Beraja et al., 2020).==== This literature is new and Liu (2019) provides some early empirical evidence of such transmission. Our paper contributes to this literature by providing a clean identification of a policy shock across upstream and downstream producers.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a brief institutional background of the regulation. We describe the dataset we use and documents some first-cut evidences of our findings in Section 3. Section 4 explains the empirical strategy and deals with the concerns related to the endogeneity of the ban. Section 5 describes our benchmark results, the mechanism(s) behind them, and effects on overall firm performance. We also examine what happened to the downstream firms in Section 6. Lastly, we discuss our findings and implications in Section 7.",Cross-border environmental regulation and firm labor demand,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069622001061,7 November 2022,2022,Research Article,40.0

We examine the effectiveness of ==== in an economy with ==== and endogenous firm relocation and entry/exit. We show that, although environmental regulation is effective in the short run, in the presence of ====, spatial relocation of firms in response to environmental regulation can undermine the effectiveness of regulations, rendering them less effective or even ineffective. In fact, we show that regulation might even be counter-productive, i.e., exacerbate environmental problems, at certain stages of development. We present initial empirical evidence in the context of water pollution in China that demonstrates the importance of agglomeration economies in determining the impacts of environmental regulation.","One of the most visible and highly publicized environmental problems in China, India and some other emerging economies is high concentrations of air pollution in their major cities. Almost all the top 25 most polluted cities in the world were located in those countries, with China and India accounting for most of them during the last ten years (IQAir 2022). In November 2021, schools in New Delhi were shut down for a week due to high levels of air pollution as the megacity was considering imposing a complete lockdown (Kim 2021). Water pollution is also a common problem, with India's Ganges River and China's Yangtze River often listed as the most polluted rivers in the world (Dhiraj 2017). In addition, environmental problems in those countries seem persistent, despite efforts to address them. For example, ever since Beijing was selected to host the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in 2001, the Chinese government has been trying to improve air quality in China. It has imposed many dramatic policy measures, including forcing heavily polluting firms to shut down, imposing driving restrictions, and limiting new car purchases in some major cities (Zheng and Kahn 2013). Despite these efforts, air quality problems persisted in many Chinese cities. During this period total populations have more than doubled in many Chinese cities. The sheer increase in the volume of economic activity and the associated congestion and pollution have significantly impeded efforts to improve air quality in many Chinese cities.====In this paper we examine one factor that might contribute to why it can be so challenging to improve air quality in cities like Beijing and New Delhi during certain period of development, namely, the interplay between environmental regulation and agglomeration economies. We show that, in the presence of agglomeration economies, spatial relocation of firms in response to environmental regulation can undermine the effectiveness of regulations, rendering them less effective or even ineffective. In fact, we show that regulation might even be counter-productive, i.e., exacerbate environmental problems, at certain stages of development.====Broadly speaking, agglomeration economies are positive externalities generated when a large number of firms or individuals are located in close proximity to one another (====, Henderson 2010). Agglomeration economies have long been a focal point of scholarly inquiry in regional and urban economics. The classic work has identified primary sources of agglomeration economies, including labor market pooling, input sharing, transport cost savings, knowledge spillovers, and consumer preferences for a variety of goods and services (see Duranton and Puga (2004) for a review of the literature). A large body of empirical literature has also tested the nature and scope of alternative sources of agglomeration economies and suggests that agglomeration economies are major determinants of the spatial distribution of economic activity.==== When economic activity in turn generates pollution, these same agglomeration economies can have important environmental implications as well, particularly in rapidly urbanizing economies. For example, the resulting agglomeration may lead to both higher pollution in urban areas as well as more exposure as urban populations grow.====It is well recognized that agglomeration can lead to increased pollution and exposure (see literature review in Section 2). However, agglomeration can also affect the effectiveness of environmental regulation by affecting the cost of regulation and the benefit of agglomeration. For example, because firms in a larger market have easier access to information and technologies for pollution control, they may face lower compliance costs than firms in smaller markets, thereby increasing the benefits of agglomeration. In addition, environmental regulation aimed at reducing pollution can initially improve environmental quality in urban areas and thereby reduce the costs of agglomeration. In both cases, the effect of the regulation on the net benefits of agglomeration will in turn impact the concentration of economic activity and hence output and pollution. This indirect feedback effect through agglomeration can offset the direct effect of the regulation and thus reduce its effectiveness. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been little, if any, research that has analyzed the effect of agglomeration economies on the effectiveness of environmental policy through these linkages.====A primary objective of this paper is to understand how endogenous responses to agglomeration economies can affect the effectiveness of environmental policy. To address this question, we first develop a theoretical model of an economy with pollution and agglomeration economies and use the model to analyze the effectiveness of environmental policy. We consider two types of regulatory policies: a uniform standard that is applied in all regions, and a differentiated standard that is higher in more polluted regions. For each, we contrast the effectiveness of policy under the typical short run assumption of fixed firm location with its effectiveness if entrepreneurs facing agglomeration economies can endogenously relocate their firms within the country in response to changes in environmental quality (as well as prices and profits) in those regions. The importance of environmental quality as a location factor has been noted by, for example, Burkitt and Spegele (2013), who report that having to breathe the severely polluted air in cities such as Beijing and Shanghai has led some entrepreneurs to favor locating in other less polluted cities. We also consider policy effectiveness with not only endogenous relocation but also endogenous entry/exit. This reflects the fact that emerging economies are often characterized by not only rapid urbanization but also an increasing number of new firms. For example, China's “economic miracle”, a shift from a largely agrarian society to an industrial powerhouse, was started by a fundamental reform in its economic system in 1978. This reform removed barriers for laborers to establish private enterprises and led to a dramatic increase in the number of firms in China.====The theoretical model suggests that consideration of agglomeration economies and firm relocations and entry/exit can change some of the classic results regarding the impact of environmental policy. In particular, we find that, although standards commonly used for emission control are effective in reducing aggregate pollution in the short run when both the number and location of firms are fixed, they may not have the intended result once endogenous relocation and entry/exit are considered. In particular, with endogenous relocation a regulatory standard will generally be less effective and might actually exacerbate pollution problems (====., lead to more total emissions, higher spatial concentration of pollution, and/or larger pollution damages). The key reason is that adoption of cleaner technology makes agglomeration less costly, which can lead to increased spatial concentrations of firms and more economic activity that can offset the direct environmental benefit of regulation.==== As a result, an “environmental stagnation” or “environmental trap” can occur in economies that are partially agglomerated, a situation characteristic of rapidly urbanizing countries. If over time firms also make endogenous entry/exit decisions, standards can still be counterproductive depending on how they affect firms’ costs.====We also take an initial step to explore the interaction between environmental regulation and agglomeration economies empirically, in the context of water pollution regulation in China. We first provide evidence consistent with our theoretical result that the impact of environmental regulation in a region depends on its agglomeration economies. We show that agglomeration economies reduce the impact of regulations on the number of firms in a county and work to undermine regulation's impact on pollution reduction. In our theoretical model this is due, in part, to the impact of agglomeration on the cost of reducing emissions. We therefore also present empirical evidence supporting this assumption. In particular, we show that firms that discharge Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) pollution face lower abatement costs when located in counties with larger agglomeration economies. Both the theory and the empirical analysis highlight the importance of incorporating agglomeration economies when considering the impact of environmental policy and provide a possible explanation for, or at least a factor contributing to, the challenges for environmental improvements in rapidly urbanizing economies.====The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we provide a brief overview of the related literature. Section 3 presents the basic setup of the model, and Section 4 characterizes the equilibrium outcomes in the short run as well as in the intermediate and the long run without environmental regulation, which serves as a baseline for evaluating the effect of environmental policy. Section 5 analyzes the effectiveness of uniform environmental policy, while Section 6 focuses on the effect of a spatially differentiated policy. Section 7 presents empirical evidence that supports the importance of the link between environmental regulation and agglomeration in the context of water pollution control in China.

Does this apply also to bilateral climate aid? In this paper, we combine theoretical and empirical analyses to investigate how bilateral trade affects donor countries’ allocations of bilateral climate aid. Our theoretical analysis develops a simple model to support our hypothesis that bilateral trade has a positive impact on climate aid transfers. The model highlights the terms-of-trade and positive income effects of climate aid, and predicts a positive relationship between donor countries’ exports to and imports from recipient countries and their climate aid transfers. The empirical analysis is based on bilateral climate aid data for 2002 to 2017. We employ fixed effects and instrumental variable-2 stage least square estimations (IV-2SLS) with a shift-share instrument to overcome the endogeneity of trade. Our empirical results show that donors’ exports have a significant, robust, positive effect on climate aid transfers.","Despite the Paris Agreement (2015), there lacks an international climate treaty setting legally binding caps on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for individual countries (Bohringer et al., 2021). Existing climate agreements are undermined by free-riding behavior, lack of participation, unambitious targets, and carbon leakage due mainly to international trade. International aid for climate mitigation and adaptation from the developed countries could help to scale-up developing countries’ climate mitigation efforts and help those countries to adapt to climate change. During the climate change negotiations in Cancun in 2010, the developed countries signed up to a joint mobilization target of $100 billion per year by 2020 to meet the needs of developing countries. This was reconfirmed by the Paris Agreement in 2015 which set an amount of aid of at least $100 billion per year up to 2025. However, the amount of climate aid from the developed countries has fallen well below this target (Roberts et al., 2021). In 2019, these transfers represented $79.6 billion dollars per year. The need for aid to enable adaptations to climate change is even more urgent than the need for climate mitigation assistance (United Nations Environment Programme, 2021).====This situation is highlighting the need to investigate the determinants of international climate aid. Empirical evidence in the foreign aid literature (Alesina and Dollar, 2000, Berthelemy, 2006, Dudley and Montmarquette, 1976, McKinlay and Little, 1977) indicates that donor interests are as important as recipient needs and merits in the allocation of foreign aid by donor countries. In this paper, we provide a systematic examination of whether bilateral trade motivates the allocation of bilateral climate aid==== by donor countries by proposing a simple theoretical model and providing empirical evidence.====Before presenting the literature which examines the determinants of climate aid, we survey the literature that analyzes the effectiveness of climate aid which is rather limited. Most of the literature has assessed the impact of foreign aid, and not climate aid per se, on environmental issues including GHG emissions: see for instance, on foreign aid, Arvin et al. (2006), Arvin and Lew (2009), Kretschmer et al. (2013) and Lim et al. (2015), and for sectoral aid such as energy or renewable energy-related aid, see for instance Kretschmer et al. (2013), Bhattacharyya et al. (2016), Mahalik et al. (2021) and Kablan and Chouard (2022). These contributions provide mitigated results in terms of GHG emission reductions. For instance, Kretschmer et al. (2013) find foreign aid to be efficient in reducing the energy intensity of recipient countries but do not find any significant impact of foreign aid on emissions intensity. As concerns environmental aid, Kablan and Chouard (2022) find a small negative impact of aid for renewable energy on CO2 emissions of recipient countries, but this effect is only transitory. Bhattacharyya et al. (2016) do not find any significant impact of environmental energy-related aid on CO2 and SO2 emissions of recipient countries. Finally, Lee et al. (2022) find a significant negative effect of multilateral climate aid on CO2 emissions. This effect is greater for mitigation aid than for adaptation aid. The authors also find climate aid to be more efficient in reducing carbon emissions in Small Islands Developing States (SIDS) and higher income developing countries.====The effectiveness of climate aid is closely related to the allocation of this aid by donor countries and thus to the environmental, economic, and geopolitical factors that motivate this allocation. Several works examine the determinants of climate aid (Betzold and Weiler, 2017, Clist, 2011, Halimanjaya, 2015, Halimanjaya and Papyrakis, 2015, Persson and Remling, 2014, Robinson and Dornan, 2017, Stadelmann et al., 2014) by measuring the determinants of the payments and receipt of climate transfers based on aggregate transfers. Except Weiler et al. (2018), none of these studies investigates the bilateral relations between countries. These bilateral relations which consist of commercial, cultural, geographic, and geopolitical ties are important and can modify the architecture of climate transfers. An empirical study by Weiler et al. (2018) shows that bilateral adaptation aid is correlated with the donor country’s exports to the aid recipient but the authors do not distinguish between trade flows. We try to identify the trade flows (both exports and imports) which determine bilateral climate aid, and provide an economic justification for climate aid and validate it empirically. We suggest that the provision of aid is based on pre-existing commercial relations founded on historical, geographic, and geopolitical factors which are threatened by the effects of climate change on the productive capacity of fragile countries. Specifically, the donor countries are keen to maintain these trade relations to conserve the benefit they provide for both parties. They may provide aid for adaptation to climate change or to reduce GHG emissions (which could also have local negative effects). We propose a simple theoretical model to show how climate aid is determined positively by the donor country’s imports and exports vis-à-vis the recipient country.====The persistence of old trade relations is investigated in a stream of work that was initiated by Eichengreen and Irwin (1998) who highlighted the continuity of trade relations based on old colonial or migratory relations which resist shocks. Eichengreen’s work gave rise to a large empirical literature on this historical dependence of trade relations (see for instance De Sousa and Lochard, 2012, Lavallée and Lochard, 2019). Our data show that the trade relations analyzed predate the signing of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997. However, the effects of climate change have increased with no accompanying threat to trade relations.====The links between foreign aid and international trade have been widely studied in other contexts than climate change (for empirical studies, see for instance Alesina and Dollar, 2000, Berthelemy, 2006, Barthel et al., 2014, Fuchs et al., 2015). Barthel et al. (2014) and Fuchs et al. (2015) depart from the fact that there are inefficiencies in current foreign aid systems with some recipient countries being favored disproportionately and a lack of coordination over aid flows among donor countries. It has been argued that donor countries compete to allocate foreign aid to certain recipient countries in order to increase their share of international trade. Fuchs et al. (2015) show that competition over exports to recipient countries results in donor allocations being inefficient and not based on recipient countries’ needs or merit. Barthel et al. (2014) show that if a donor country increases its aid allocation to a certain recipient country, other donor countries in competition with the first donor in terms of exports also increase their allocation of aid to that recipient country. However, these studies consider overall foreign aid while we focus specifically on climate aid and propose a theoretical model to guide our empirical analysis.====Much of the theoretical literature on aid and trade focuses on the aid paradox==== that aid can degrade the recipient country’s welfare. The transfer of a good to a country which expresses strong demand for that good will raise the price of that good which has a negative effect on the welfare of the recipient country (Chichilnisky (1980); see also Geanakoplos and Heal, 1983, Yano, 1983 and Basu (2003)). The literature focuses also on improvements to the terms of trade: foreign aid directed toward the export sector of the recipient country improves the recipient country’s productivity and lowers the relative price of the exported good. This in turn benefits the donor country. The terms of trade effect of aid has been modeled in the context of climate adaptation aid (Schenker and Stephan, 2014). This highlights two problems. On the one hand, a mechanism similar to the one highlighted above may emerge. If the price of the good whose technology is being favored falls too much, the recipient country may experience a negative income shock and suffer a welfare loss. On the other hand, the other countries importing the good produced by the sector that is the recipient of the aid may also profit from a drop in the international price of the good. These international price externalities inevitably induce strategic and free-rider behaviors. However, although these strategic behaviors may slow the provision of aid, it still exists but becomes less important (Schenker and Stephan, 2017).====The objective of our analysis==== is to identify the trade determinants of climate aid. Our theoretical model develops a simple trade model to provide an explanation for the existence of climate aid: the maintenance of former trade relations based on colonial ties, geopolitics, etc. which could be degraded by climate change. Indeed, climate change degrades the productivity of exporting industries in developing countries. In order to maintain the former trade relations (i.e. to keep constant the sum of the utilities of the pair of countries), the donor provides both mitigation and adaptation aid. Climate aid can alleviate the effects of climate change via two channels: the “price effect” and the “income effect”. Thanks to climate aid, the price of the good produced by the recipient decreases (the price effect) and the income of the recipient increases (the income effect). The price effect increases the donor country’s imports, and the income effect increases the donor country’s exports. According to the mechanism highlighted by Schenker and Stephan (2014), climate aid makes it possible to reestablish the terms of trade of the developing country which could have been degraded by climate change. We are aware that this aid might reduce the recipient country’s welfare due to the already mentioned negative income effect. We show that this does not occur if the climate aid has a sufficiently strong income effect (in terms of reducing the adverse impacts of climate change on the recipient country’s productive process or in terms of increasing the productivity). Rather, the recipient country benefits from aid in terms of welfare. For a given level of the stock of global GHG emissions, if the impact of aid is sufficiently strong, the recipient country’s imports and exports improve. In other words, the welfare of both countries increases which is a necessary condition for the acceptability of aid by both countries. These mechanisms translate into a positive and reciprocal mathematical relationship between the donor country’s imports and exports and climate aid. Thus, the empirical analysis aims to validate this relationship and eliminate possible endogeneity biases via an IV method.====In the empirical part of the paper, we provide an econometric evaluation of the predictions of our theoretical model by estimating the impact of trade on aid. We use the OECD Official Development Assistance (ODA) data relative to climate actions, and consider bilateral climate transfers from the members of OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) between 2002 and 2017. We use a panel data model with donor, recipient, and year fixed effects (FE). We control for the recipient’s environmental vulnerability, economic development, and institutional quality, and the historical and political relationships between donor and recipient that we put forward in the model. The main empirical difficulty is the potential simultaneous determination of climate transfers and trade decisions, as emphasized by our theoretical model. To overcome endogeneity concerns, we use an instrumental variables strategy in a two-stage least squares estimation (IV-2SLS) where we instrument the level of trade using a shift-share instrument. In particular, we use variations in world demand at the product level based on previous and lagged trade patterns to identify trade variations uncorrelated with country decisions and relationships. This strategy allows ==== estimates of trade on climate aid transfers. In our methodology, our results are identified from variations in aid and trade across country pairs. Our estimation strategy is in line with state-of-the-art estimations of the determinants of foreign aid which we apply to this specific type of climate aid transfers.====Our estimations confirm the significant and quantitative role of trade as a determinant of climate aid which is in line with our theoretical predictions. For a given donor of climate aid, its exports to a specific recipient country increase climate transfers to that country. Our baseline estimates point to an elasticity of aid of around 0.3 for exports. Our estimates are robust to different specifications of the controls and potential omitted variables and to changes in the set of FE used. Our results are also not sensitive to minor violations of the exclusion restriction required for causal inferences. They are also in line with existing evidence regarding the standard determinants of foreign aid in general and of climate aid in particular. We however find no significant effect regarding donors’ imports. Overall, our results show that the strategic export interests of donor countries to a large extent shape the allocation of climate aid.====Our paper contributes to the literature in several ways.====First, we propose an original approach that combines theoretical and empirical analysis of the role played by trade in climate aid allocation. Second, we investigate bilateral trade relationships by providing a complete picture of the trade effects related to the allocation of climate transfers. The existing evidence points to the quantitative role of trade on foreign aid (see among others Barthel et al. (2014) and Fuchs et al. (2015)), and on climate aid (Weiler et al., 2018). Our theoretical model highlights two economic mechanisms driving two distinct effects of trade on climate aid which we are able to estimate empirically. These are respectively the imports of donor countries related to terms-of-trade effect (in line with the theoretical prediction of Schenker and Stephan (2014)), and exports of the donor country related to positive income effect. Third, we provide a robust, causal estimate of the trade effect on climate aid, accounting for the bi-directional relationships between aid and trade. We employ an IV-2SLS strategy in which we leverage exogenous trade flow variations across countries to identify the causal effect of trade on climate transfers. This allows estimation of the causal elasticity of climate aid to trade which complements the estimates in the literature (such as Weiler et al. (2018)) which however may be subject to endogeneity problems. We contribute also to a stream of work in which trade shocks are used as shifters in empirical exercises. Following the seminal contribution of Bartik (1991), this type of strategy has been extensively used at both the aggregate (see for instance Autor et al. (2013)) and the microeconomic levels (see for instance Mayer et al. (2014) or Aghion et al. (2018)).====Our paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the proposed theoretical model.

This paper examines the investment-related tax cuts and the policy interaction with environmental regulation on firms' emission reduction strategies. Taking China's value-added tax (VAT) reform as a quasi-natural experiment and considering the interaction with the emission reduction target policy, our difference-in-differences estimation shows that: the average effect of the VAT reform reduces firms' sulfur dioxide (SO====) emission intensity by 16.6%, due to the adoption of emissions reduction strategies in the production processes; the interaction effect between the VAT reform and environmental regulation incentivizes firms to additionally reduce SO==== emission intensity, due to the adoption of both production processes and end-of-pipe reduction strategies. Our findings are more evident for firms with tight financial constraints. Overall, this paper reveals the micro-mechanisms of how the tax policies incentivize firms to choose emission reduction strategies and highlights the importance of the interaction effects between environmental and non-environmental policies, thus providing implications for the policy mix of environmental regulation and tax-cut incentives to promote pollution reduction and improve business performance.","The existing theoretical and empirical literature has mainly focused on the role of environmental policies in emission reduction (Klier and Linn, 2015; Acemoglu and Rafey, 2018; Greenstone et al., 2021), yet little attention is paid to the emission reduction effects of non-environmental policies. Non-environmental policies may affect firm emission reductions through production processes and end-of-pipe. For example, tax incentives for investment (such as the cut in value-added tax, VAT) may influence firms’ emission reduction strategies and pollution as they will adjust optimal decisions in response to the lower prices of fixed assets.====On the one hand, investment-related tax cuts can directly increase productivity to lower costs by increasing the scale of investment (Zwick and Mahon, 2017; Ohrn, 2019; Moon, 2022), thereby reducing emission intensity (i.e., emission per unit of output value). On the other hand, investment-related tax cuts can further provide an opportunity for firms to adjust their emission reduction strategies to cope with the rising cost of pollution emissions due to enhanced external environmental regulation. Therefore, the interaction of environmental and non-environmental policies may have additional emission reduction consequences. We try to provide rigorous and comprehensive empirical evidence in the context of China, the world's largest manufacturer and emitter.====To encourage firms to increase fixed-asset investment, China launched a pilot scheme for VAT reform in 2004 in Northeast China which allows firms to deduct input tax from equipment purchases (Cai and Harrison, 2011; Liu and Mao, 2019), and then gradually extended it nationwide. The VAT reform provides an opportunity to examine the impact of investment-related tax cuts on pollution reduction. This reform could incentivize firms to invest more in fixed assets, which, in turn, can lead to an increase in total factor productivity (TFP), thereby achieving production-process emission reductions. Though the input tax on the purchase of environmental protection equipment can be deducted, as abatement equipment is non-productive, the VAT reform may not incentivize firms to purchase more abatement equipment (i.e., the end-of-pipe reduction strategy). However, the rising cost of pollution emissions brought about by the tightening of environmental regulation will encourage firms to readjust their emission reduction strategies.====Though the abatement equipment is non-productive to increase output, it can help firms to reduce pollution to meet environmental requirements. In other words, the abatement equipment can contribute to firms' profit by avoiding being punished when they face more stringent environmental regulation. Allowing firms to deduct input tax, the VAT reform can provide additional cash flow to purchase abatement equipment. The policy mix of the VAT reform and environmental regulation may incentivize firms to adopt the end-of-pipe emission reduction strategy. Meanwhile, to meet the requirements of stricter environmental regulation, firms will continue to consider improving their production-process emission reduction capacity by purchasing highly efficient energy-saving equipment, and changing their energy structure. In summary, the policy mix of investment-related tax cuts and environmental regulation can help achieve a better balance between economic development and environmental performance. Considering that many firms are restricted to adjust optimal decisions in reality, we may find more significant emission strategy adjustments for firms with tight financial constraints. In 2006, the Chinese central government enforced the emission reduction target policy, which links the promotion of local officials to the achievement of the reduction target (Shi and Xu, 2018). The implementation of the strict environmental policy provides an opportunity for us to further test the interaction effect of the VAT reform and environmental regulation on firms' emission reduction strategies.====In this paper, we construct a simple model in which a representative firm adopts different capital investment strategies under different VAT and emissions constraints, to explain the mechanism by which tax policy affects pollution reduction strategies. This paper empirically evaluates the average effect of the VAT reform and the interaction effect between the VAT reform and environmental regulation on sulfur dioxide (SO====) pollution, using the panel data obtained by merging two large firm-level databases from 1999 to 2012. In particular, we employ a variety of methods to address the potential endogeneity, such as the non-randomness of the VAT reform and emission reduction targets. We include industry-year and province-year fixed effects to control for the potential confounding factors from the VAT reform. We search for the key determinants of the city-level SO==== reduction targets and interact them with year dummies to deal with potential endogenous biases, using the intensity of thermal inversions as the instrumental variable for the SO==== reduction targets. Additionally, we conduct a series of robustness checks to test the validity of the empirical strategy, including the test for parallel trends with event study, triple difference strategy, inverse probability weighting (IPW), PSM-DID identification strategy, as well as placebo tests.====The empirical results validate the propositions made by the theoretical model. The average effect of the VAT reform on pollution emissions is a 16.6% reduction in SO==== emission intensity. Taking the zero SO==== reduction target as the situation where regulation is assumed to be absent, we can estimate the stand-alone effect of the VAT reform which incentivizes firms to reduce SO==== emission intensity by 9%. The interaction effect between the VAT reform and environmental regulation incentivizes firms to additionally reduce SO==== emission intensity by 6.15% under the mean intensity of environmental regulation (12.83%).====The VAT reform policy can reduce the SO==== generation intensity (i.e., the amount of SO==== generation per unit of output value) mainly by adopting a production processes strategy including encouraging firms to adopt more energy-saving technologies, rather than improve their energy composition. When the external environmental regulations are increasingly tighter, the VAT reform will incentivize firms to adopt both the production processes and end-of-pipe emission reduction strategies. Specifically, the interaction effect between the VAT reform and environmental regulation incentivizes firms to reduce the SO==== generation intensity by improving energy efficiency, optimizing the energy structure by increasing the proportion of clean gas and increasing the SO==== removal rate (i.e., the ratio of removed SO==== before finally discharged into the air) by purchasing more abatement facilities. The heterogeneity analysis consistently suggests that the emission reduction strategy adjustment is more evident for firms with tight financial constraints.====The contributions of this article to the existing literature are threefold.====First, this paper provides rigorous and comprehensive empirical evidence on the impact of investment-related tax cuts on firms’ emission reduction strategies. In particular, we pay attention to VAT, which is a general and neutral tax and, indeed, does not directly affect the cost of pollution emissions. The impact of VAT reform on investment, exports, labor reallocation, and productivity has been the focus of prior studies (Cai and Harrison, 2011; Zhang et al., 2018; Liu and Lu, 2015; Chen et al., 2021). We extend investment-based tax incentives to pollution abatement, as the VAT reform provides more opportunities for firms to choose abatement strategies, and further analyze the mechanism by which the VAT reform stimulates firms' adjustment of emission reduction strategies and provides detailed micro-evidence (an important supplement to the existing literature) on the impact of investment-related tax policy on the environmental governance (Lin, 2013; Yamazaki, 2022; Karydas and Zhang, 2019; Helm and Mier, 2021). The results show the unique role of non-environmental tax policy in achieving great environmental performance (Eichner and Pethig, 2019; Peng et al., 2021; Kong and Zhu, 2022).====Second, from the perspective of policy interaction, this paper highlights the importance of the interaction effect between tax incentives and environmental regulation. Strengthening the linkage and coordination between policies is potential for dealing with increasingly complex environmental problems. Existing literature pays special attention to the interaction effects of environmental policies (Mandell, 2008; Fankhauser and HepburnPark, 2010; Levinson, 2011; Caillaud and Demange, 2017; Ambec and Coria, 2021; Lin and Linn, 2019). Specifically, the discussion of the interaction effect mainly exists in command-and-control environmental policies, market-based incentive environmental policies, and public participation environmental policies. Insufficient attention has been paid to the complementarity and cooperation between environmental and non-environmental policies. This study provides evidence of the interaction effects between these two types of policies. The policy mix of environmental regulation and tax-cut incentives could incentivize firms to implement both production-process and end-of-pipe reduction strategies by incorporating the meeting of environmental regulatory requirements into the profit function. The cooperation of environmental and non-environmental policies can avoid the distortion brought about by the previous command-and-control policy.====Third, this study is particularly relevant to improving environmental governance performance. In the context of green recovery and green transformation, achieving both pollution reduction and business performance is the core objectives of environmental governance. One potential direction for improving environmental governance performance is to interact with non-environmental policies to reduce the implementation costs of environmental policies (Acemoglu and Rafey, 2018; He et al., 2020). For example, investment-related tax incentives can provide opportunities for firms to adjust their emission reduction strategies in response to environmental regulation. Our research has important implications for developing countries that are highly dependent on command-and-control policies to improve environmental quality, strengthening the interaction between market incentive policies and environmental regulation, which can help achieve emission reduction and business performance improvement.====The rest of this paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the background of China's VAT reform and emission reduction target policies. Section 3 provides a simple theoretical model. Section 4 introduces an empirical design framework and describes variables, data, and econometric models. In Section 5, we present the main empirical results of this paper.

We find that on average, Bogotá’s lockdown cut PM==== pollution by 15% and NO==== pollution by 21%. However, the magnitude of these effects varied considerably over time and across the city's neighborhoods. Equivalent permanent reductions in these pollutants would reduce long-term premature deaths from air pollution by 23% each year, a benefit valued at $1 billion annually. Finally, we estimate that if they occurred ====, the temporary reductions in pollutant concentrations in 2020–2021 due to Bogotá’s lockdown would have cut short-term deaths from air pollution by 19%, a benefit valued at $244 million.","In cities around the world, lockdowns aimed at slowing the spread of COVID-19 have had an unintended co-benefit: by restricting mobility and economic activity, they have improved outdoor air quality, in some cases dramatically. For example, ==== find that in 22 cities in India, levels of particulate matter smaller than 2.5 μm (PM====), particulate matter smaller than 10 μm (PM====), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen dioxide (NO====) fell by 43, 31, 10, and 18 percent, respectively. ==== find that in Buenos Aires, concentrations of PM==== and NO==== fell by 44 and 33 percent, respectively. And ==== find that in 34 countries around the world, on average, lockdowns led to a 31 percent reduction in PM==== and a 60 percent reduction in NO==== (see also ====). News media accounts suggest that in cities with chronic severe air pollution, these improvements were palpable and plain for all to see, particularly in the weeks just after lockdowns began: long-obscured vistas were suddenly reliably clear, and respiratory symptoms associated with air pollution noticeably diminished (====; ====).====Even if only temporary, such conspicuous improvements in air quality could, in principle, have longer-lasting effects on policy by making pollution problems more salient and by boosting political pressure for change, in much the same way that extreme weather events appear to enhance political pressure for climate action (====; ====). In cities with chronic severe air pollution, both citizens and policymakers have arguably become inured to the problem. The air quality improvements associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have the potential to change that by demonstrating that a cleaner alternative is both possible and attainable in a relatively short timeframe, albeit by using extreme measures.====To that end, it is important to develop credible objective estimates of both the air quality improvements associated with COVID-19 lockdowns and the benefits these improvements generate. Such estimates, in turn, can inform efforts to “build back better”—that is, to include in economic recovery packages investments in clean energy, electromobility, public transportation, and other types of infrastructure that would help avoid a return to prepandemic levels of ====.====). We estimate the effect of the city's lockdown, which lasted from March 2020 to June 2021, on air quality and avoided mortality and we also estimate the monetary value of the avoided mortality. Our analysis has three stages. First, we use fixed effects panel-data models along with 12 years of daily data from Bogotá’s air quality monitoring network (among other sources) to econometrically estimate the effect of the lockdown on ambient concentrations of PM==== and NO==== and NO==== concentrations on long-term and short-term human mortality. Finally, we use benefit transfer methods to estimate the monetary value of this avoided mortality.====We find that on average, Bogotá’s lockdown caused a 15 percent reduction in ambient PM==== and a 21 percent reduction in ambient NO====. However, these effects varied over time. They were largest in the two months after the lockdown was initiated in March 2020, attenuated over the next 6 months as lockdown restrictions were relaxed, and were relatively large again in the first quarter of 2021, when restrictions were tightened in response to a holiday surge in infections. The effects of the lockdown also varied spatially: they were largest in the central and southwestern parts of the city, which had the highest average pre-lockdown levels of PM==== and NO====. In general, our epidemiological models suggest that the effects of the lockdown on long- and short-term mortality roughly scaled with the effects on PM==== and NO====. We find that permanent reductions in ambient PM==== and NO==== of the same magnitude as those generated by Bogotá’s lockdown would save 640 lives per year, a 23 percent reduction from counterfactual rates, and that temporary ==== reductions in pollutant concentrations in 2020–2021 due to Bogotá’s lockdown would have cut short-term deaths from air pollution by 19 percent. Finally, we find that the monetary value of avoided long-term mortality would be $1 billion per year, which represents 1.2 percent of the city's 2019 GDP, and that the value of avoided short-term mortality would be $244 million, which represents 0.3 percent of Bogotá's 2019 GDP.====; ====), an approach subject to substantial bias because of the confounding effects of, among other things, weather during the lockdown year. For example, ==== find that after controlling for weather, estimated effects of lockdowns on air quality in 11 cities around the world were significantly smaller than what simple before-and-after comparisons suggest. Regarding (b), few studies use econometrically estimated effects of lockdowns on air quality to simulate impacts on human health. Exceptions include ==== and ====.==== Regarding (c), only a small set of studies estimate the monetary value of avoided mortality due to a COVID-19 lockdown (e.g., ====).====Second, we examine both temporal and spatial variation in the effects of a COVID-19 lockdown on air quality within an urban area. We are not aware of any other studies that do that. Third, we directly control for the effect on air quality of wildfires, an important source of air pollution in cities in the Global South (====; ====). Again, we are not aware of any other studies that do that. Finally, whereas most studies of the effect of COVID-19 lockdowns on air quality measure relatively short-term effects during the first several months of the lockdown, we examine effects over the entire 16-month course of a lockdown.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The next section briefly presents background on Bogotá’s air pollution and its COVID-19 lockdown. The third section summarizes the methods, data, and results from each of the three stages of our analysis. And the last section sums up and discusses policy implications.====. In principle, we could econometrically identify short-term effects of the reductions in ambient PM==== and NO==== associated with Bogotá’s lockdown by regressing observed deaths during our entire 12-year panel onto a lockdown indicator variable along with other time-varying covariates. In practice, however, identification would likely be confounded by the pandemic, both because it caused a significant contemporaneous spike in mortality and because it likely affected Bogotá residents' incentives to seek health care, their behaviors and emotional states, the provision of health care, and the reporting of mortality data.====To explore this issue, we analyze 2015–2021 daily data on deaths by cause for the six death causes commonly associated with exposure to air pollution: acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI); cancer of the lung, trachea, and bronchus; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); ischemic heart disease (IHD); type 2 diabetes mellitus; and stroke (====). For two of these death causes—diabetes and stroke—we find a positive correlation between the COVID-19 lockdown and deaths despite the significant improvements in air quality during the lockdown described in the previous section (====). These two positive correlations persist even after controlling for COVID-19 cases and other potentially confounding factors (====). The implication is that unobserved confounders likely bias upward (smaller negative effects) econometrically estimated short-term mortality effects of the reductions in air pollution associated with the lockdown.====. Using epidemiological models to simulate deaths avoided as a result of reductions in air pollution associated with the lockdown also may not accurately reflect the true number of deaths avoided. The reason is that the epidemiological models used to generate these estimates are based on prepandemic empirical correlations between daily pollution levels and daily premature mortality. However, these correlations were likely different during the pandemic as a result of the same confounding factors listed above—patients’ incentives to seek medical care, their behavior and emotional states, their access to medical care, etc. These confounding factors likely have countervailing effects on simulated short-term mortality estimates, and the overall net effect is uncertain. On one hand, some likely bias these estimates upward (smaller negative effects). Bogotá residents presumably were more hesitant to visit hospitals during the pandemic for fear of contracting COVID-19, and access to all manner of health care was more restricted. That, in turn, implies that during the pandemic, spikes in PM==== and NO==== caused more deaths from exposure to air pollution than in prepandemic times, and as a result, reductions in the frequency of those spikes associated with the lockdown would have avoided more deaths. But other confounding factors could bias simulated estimates of actual avoided death downward (larger negative effects). For example, Bogotá residents presumably stayed indoors more during the pandemic and were therefore less exposed to air pollution. That, in turn, implies that spikes in PM==== and NO==== caused fewer deaths during the pandemic than in prepandemic times, and as a result, reductions in the frequency of those spikes associated with the lockdown would have avoided fewer deaths.",Quantifying COVID-19’s silver lining: Avoided deaths from air quality improvements in Bogotá,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069622001024,25 October 2022,2022,Research Article,44.0

To combat this problem, several states have passed lead abatement laws, forcing landlords to remove lead in the homes they rent if tenants have children under the age of 6. However, these laws have unintended consequences, causing landlords to evict tenants rather than abate lead. I use a difference-in-differences approach while employing various model specifications with various fixed effects and sets of controls to examine the impact of Ohio’s 2003 lead abatement law on eviction rates. Using newly collected data from the Eviction Lab at Princeton University, I find that the passage of Ohio’s lead abatement law sharply increased targeted evictions. Due to the law’s passage, the average census district in Ohio faced an increased eviction rate of roughly 0.457 points, corresponding to an additional 13.93 evictions a year. These impacts are highly statistically significant, sizeable, and economically meaningful, indicating that policy makers should incorporate distributional consequences when designing future lead abatement laws in order to avoid unintended consequences and ensure equitable outcomes.","Lead is an abundant, relatively inexpensive chemical with many uses: in manufacturing, in paint, in piping. In the early part of the 20th century it was used liberally, especially in the painting of homes. Lead paint dries faster, is more durable, holds color better, and is more corrosion-resistant than non-lead paint. Therefore, ignoring the health consequences, lead was an ideal element to add to paint. While it has been known that lead causes damage to the human body since the late 19th century, public health officials did not restrict the use of lead in personal or public dwellings until much later, in the 1970s.====Lead has a large and varied impact on the human body, causing damage to the kidneys, cardiovascular system, reproductive system, and, most notably, the nervous system. High and/or prolonged exposure to the chemical can elevate blood lead levels, leading to lead poisoning, causing severe nervous system damage, behavioral changes, and even death. Lead poisoning also causes miscarriages, premature births, and birth defects among pregnant women. Due to their quick rate of growth and thus quick rate of lead intake, children under the age of 6 are considered at highest risk for lead poisoning. Moreover, lead poisoning has been shown to have severe developmental impacts in children (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2005, Needleman, 2004), resulting in behavioral problems in students (Aizer and Currie, 2019), reducing proficiency in reading and other subjects (Aizer et al., 2018), and increasing rates of special education enrollment in schools==== (see Miranda et al., 2010, Tarr et al., 2009). Additionally, lead poisoning leads to increased rates of adverse and antisocial behavior, such as crime, teen pregnancy, and aggressive and violent behavior in both childhood and adulthood (see Reyes, 2007, Reyes, 2014). These issues are especially pronounced in poor and minority communities.====To get a sense of the prevalence of lead poisoning consider Ohio. In 2018, of 168,352 children tested, 0.7% had an elevated lead level in the blood of greater than 10 ==== (blood lead level considered “elevated” until 2015) and 2.3% had a level of lead in the blood above 5 ==== (blood lead level considered “elevated” after 2015). This is down significantly from the 4.3% rate of elevated blood levels of greater than 10 ==== of the 112,999 tested children in 2003 (Ohio Department of Health, 2019).====The use of lead paint was made illegal for use in residential, interior painting in 1978, following a patchwork ban on lead in paint for external use in the 1950s, which lead to a national ban in 1971. Lead paint is especially damaging as it degrades into easily-to-inhale lead-heavy dust, damaging the health of those in and around a building. However, the vast majority of houses built before 1978 still contain some amount of lead (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018). To get an idea of the likelihood of having lead-based paint in one’s home, one must simply look at the age of the home one is occupying. According to the EPA, 87% of homes built before 1940 still have lead-based paint in them, whereas 69% built between 1940 and 1959 still have lead-based paint present, as do 24% of homes built between 1960 and 1977 (Environmental Protection Agency, 2020). This implies the prevalence of lead-based paint, and thus probability of exposure, conditional on making no other choices, in the state of Ohio is roughly 38%.====While many of these homes have been made safe for human occupancy through the processes of lead removal and/or lead abatement, many homes still have dangerously high levels of lead. In the residential setting, lead removal is conducted through renovation of walls and surfaces, repair of surfaces with issues, and repainting. The ultimate goal of most lead removal projects is lead abatement: the removal of lead from an environment with the goal of making that environment permanently lead-free.==== Not all lead removal projects intend to fully abate lead, some are only intended as temporary fixes; this paper focuses on lead abatement only. In order for a house to receive a positive lead abatement status, a landlord must either remove all lead in their rental units or have successfully sealed off and protected areas with lead paint for roughly 20 years. Lead abatement is no easy task when compared to lead removal, typically being much more expensive and time consuming. To successfully abate lead, a full inspection is undertaken and certified by a trained professional with federal and/or state level certification in lead abatement. A lead abatement plan is often put into place to identify and manage realized and expected lead-related issues.====While many homes have been made safe for human occupancy through the processes of lead removal and lead abatement, others still have dangerously high levels of lead, information which is not always reported to renters. This has led many states to pass laws mandating lead abatement, with two primary types of lead abatement laws being passed in different states. More rarely, laws are passed forcing all rental properties to abate lead. These laws exist in 3 states: Rhode Island, Maryland, and Vermont. The other, more common law, existing in over 15 states, only targets rental properties occupied by families with children. A subset of these states target only properties rented to families with children under 6, those most susceptible to lead poisoning. Ohio is an example of such a state.====However, well-intentioned laws often have unintended consequences (e.g. see Iyengar, 2009, MaCurdy and McIntyre, 2000, Gruber, 1994). While the laws passed in Ohio and other states to encourage or force lead abatement for reasons of public health, especially children’s health, were successful at reducing the disease burden due to lead (Farfel and Chisolm, 1991, Gazze, 2020), they have also led to discrimination by landlords against families with young children. Landlords may not want to incur the cost of reducing and eliminating lead in their buildings, and thus avoid renting to, or find ways to evict, tenants with young children. This is, in fact, what I find.====I use a difference-in-differences methodology combined with matching to compare census tracts in Ohio to census tracts in neighboring states without lead abatement laws==== before and after the passage of a lead abatement law in Ohio in 2003. I find that the passage of Ohio’s lead abatement law causes the average census tract==== to experience an increase in its eviction rate of roughly .457 points, increase in total number of evictions by roughly 14 evictions per year, and increase in its eviction filing rate of 1.25 points. To see the comparative magnitude of the impact of this law, consider a scenario where the percentage of households with small children in Ohio increases by one percentage point in each census tract. My results suggest that, ceteris paribus, statewide evictions would increase by 3950 evictions per year as a result of this law. This corresponds to roughly 7% of the total number of evictions in the state per year.==== This magnitude is much greater than if we were to increase the poverty rate (1000 evictions) or the percentage of African-American (400 evictions) residents by one percentage point in all census tracts. However, when examining all of these variables of interest within the same regression====, families with young children in census tracts with a higher percentage of African Americans and with more rental units face an even heavier eviction burden due to the passage of Ohio’s lead abatement law. The magnitudes of these impacts are large, economically meaningful, and heterogeneously distributed, disproportionately impacting families with young children and families from marginalized communities.====The idea that lead abatement laws may lead to discrimination has been proposed in the literature. Berman et al. (2014) examine the impact of M.G.L. ch. 111, s. 199 A, a law passed in 2012 in Massachusetts which prohibits renting a house with lead to families with children under the age of 6 until lead abatement has been completed. These authors posit that renters discriminate against families with children under the age of 6 by not renting to them to avoid the cost of abatement, though they provide little empirical support of this hypothesis. Gazze (2021) is the most influential paper to examine the distributional consequences of lead abatement laws. Using data from DataQuick and the American Housing Survey, she finds that lead abatement mandates reduce the value of older homes by 7.1% and that families with children are 11.3% less likely to live in old homes, most of which is due to discrimination against the tenant. This not only provides quantitative evidence of the impact of lead abatement laws on rental discrimination, but also identifies the parties that face the largest distributional consequences of lead abatement laws—families with small children==== and owners of older homes.====This paper is the first to provide evidence of the impact of lead abatement laws on discrimination in the context of evictions. I choose to focus on evictions for multiple reasons. Firstly, there has already been rigorous work done on the impact of lead abatement laws on discrimination in finding housing, while none has been done on resultant evictions. Secondly, by focusing on evictions, I take advantage of a new and comprehensive data set on national evictions collected by the Eviction Lab at Princeton University. Evictions have been greatly understudied in the literature; obtaining quality data on evictions has been an issue until the development of this dataset. Finally and most importantly, I focus on evictions because of its wide-reaching economic, social, and developmental repercussions (Desmond, 2012). The most direct impact of eviction is loss of home and possessions, reducing that household’s net worth. However, eviction can lead to much more economically damaging results. Eviction causes job loss, impacts mental health, and leads to increased homelessness (Collinson and Reed, 2018). As eviction and the subsequent finding of a new home are long processes reducing access to resources, children’s educational attainment is impacted by eviction. Additionally, eviction makes it more difficult to find a new place to live, as landlords often screen for prior evictions. Eviction can also lead a family to be ostracized from their community. This further compounds the mental health, educational, and monetary impacts of eviction. Eviction is also a relatively common experience, especially for renters in densely populated and poverty-stricken communities. According to the Eviction Lab, between 2000 and 2016 one eviction will be filed for every 17 renters and an eviction will actually be undertaken for every 40 renters. In the data I use, eviction is highly correlated with population characteristics,==== indicating that the groups that suffer the most from evictions are those in urban areas with high population and high poverty.====Taking all of this together paints a clear picture that eviction has far-reaching and long-lasting economic impacts and is a woefully understudied issue. My work is the first to examine the impact of lead abatement on evictions, examining distributional consequences of lead abatement laws in a unique context and recommending that abatement laws should be targeted in ways that do not put an undue burden on families with young children, especially poor and minority families, through an increased probability of eviction.====The rest of the paper is as follows. Section 2 describes the setting, data, and methodology. Section 3 presents the results. Section 4 shows that the results are robust to various uses of the data. Section 5 discusses, and Section 6 concludes.","First lead, now no bed?

Most countries, however, do not have substantial carbon pricing instruments (Stiglitz et al., 2017). Even where carbon pricing exists, price levels usually fall far short of those required to meet international climate targets. One potential reason for the insufficient use of pricing instruments is the concern that they might increase inequality. Rising costs of carbon-intensive energy and essential goods can burden low-income households more than high-income households. For example, evidence shows that low-income households spend a higher share of their income on energy and other carbon-intensive goods like food, at least in high-income countries (Flues and Thomas, 2015, Grainger and Kolstad, 2010).====Non-pricing instruments, such as fuel economy standards and technology mandates, have been more popular on a global scale, although they are not efficient (US Environmental Protection Agency, 2011, National Research Council, 2002).==== They may be preferred by politicians and the public because the price effects of these policies are less visible, and citizens are perhaps not as aware of their equity implications (Finon, 2019, Fischer and Pizer, 2019). Yet, a distributional motive for choosing non-pricing regulation, however, has not been clearly identified in prior research (see Heutel (2020)).====This study examines whether society’s preference for non-pricing instruments can be justified on equity grounds. Specifically, under which conditions are non-pricing alternatives more equitable than pricing instruments? We develop two models to examine two policy-relevant cases: efficiency standards for household energy technologies and intensity standards for carbon-intensive goods.==== We ask under which conditions these instruments have better distributional consequences than pricing. The models represent key consumer behaviours determining the carbon-intensity of consumption, which hold equity implications for climate policy.====First, we show that a preference for high-carbon technology attributes can make efficiency standards more progressive than carbon pricing in energy-services consumption.==== The intuition is simple. We assume households prefer more energy services. For very simple energy services such as lighting, two mechanisms exist: either consuming more energy or buying more efficiency. Energy services are merely the product of energy and efficiency. In cases such as lighting, therefore, richer households spend more on efficient technologies, for example, on LED lighting. However, if energy services have attributes that lead to inefficient energy usage—acceleration, comfort and roominess in the case of cars—this simple intuition is not accurate. Since such “high-carbon” attributes decrease efficiency, richer households might not use more efficient technologies after all. They might buy inefficient cars because achieving efficiency is costly when they also prefer bigger and more powerful vehicles. We design a formal model to examine this hypothesis by generalising Levinson’s (2019) set-up for simple energy services. We show that when households have a marked propensity to spend on high-carbon attributes, efficiency standards are more progressive than carbon pricing. We test the theoretical results with US data and find that such a preference exists and that standards could be more favourable for low-income groups, unless recycling of the proceeds from pricing is strongly progressive.====Second, we analyse how non-homothetic preferences may change the equity ranking between intensity standards and carbon pricing, by generalising (Klenert and Mattauch, 2016). Prior work had neither examined regulatory standards nor carbon-intensive “luxury goods” under such preferences. We show that consumption patterns and the carbon intensity of goods interact to determine which policy instrument is more favourable. When luxury goods are more carbon intensive than subsistence goods, intensity standards are better for the poor. Once again, this result holds as long as the revenue from carbon pricing is not very progressively redistributed to households. We calibrate the analytical model to the Chinese vehicle market and confirm by simulation that standards can be an equitable alternative to pricing instruments. We also show that this equity advantage may justify majority support for standards when aversion to inequality is accounted for.====Taken together, our two models illustrate how households’ preferences for both technology attributes and carbon-intensive goods play a role in determining distributional consequences of standards. Focusing on transport, for example, the models explain why richer households drive more and use bigger cars, take more flights and use less public transport. Our first model suggests that one reason is a preference for high-carbon travel attributes such as acceleration, space and comfort. Our second model represents richer households as not only driving more “gas-guzzlers” but also owning more cars and driving longer distance, while lower-income households choose public transport. Preferences for high-carbon attributes of cars, and the effect of income on propensity for car use, both shape the distributional impact of transport policy.====Our contribution builds on three strands of prior work: The first is the few studies directly discussing the incidence of regulatory standards (Fullerton and Muehlegger, 2019, Heutel, 2020, Metcalf, 2019, Rausch and Mowers, 2014). These studies reach no clear consensus. Efficiency standards are described as both regressive and progressive (Levinson, 2019, Davis and Knittel, 2019, Jacobsen, 2013). Nevertheless, several studies make a strong case against regulatory standards: Levinson (2019) develops a theoretical model showing that richer households consume more efficient technologies and more energy. Therefore, efficiency standards favour rich households more than carbon taxes do. Similarly, Metcalf (2019) argues that most regulatory energy policies in the US are regressive. A carbon tax can replace these policies and ensure a progressive outcome. Finally, a comprehensive study by Jacobsen (2013) employs a sophisticated general equilibrium model that incorporates heterogeneous households and car manufacturers. Its results show that the US fuel economy standard is regressive when the used car market is considered. If these arguments are correct, non-pricing instruments should perform worse than pricing instruments in terms of both efficiency and equity.====These empirical studies do not, however, analyse which mechanisms drive the consumption patterns observed in data. Our study identifies two theoretical mechanisms that do: high-carbon technology attributes and non-homothetic preferences. Compared to Levinson (2019), which describes households as only interested in the quantity of energy services, our theory treats households as also liking the qualitative aspects of energy services—and better quality may require more energy. This more nuanced representation of consumer behaviours helps identify the conditions required for standards to be either more or less progressive than taxes. Our conclusion therefore differs from the unambiguous conclusion reached by Levinson (2019). Furthermore, our methodological choice differs from sophisticated equilibrium simulations such as Jacobsen (2013), which covers complex labour– and product–market interactions. We choose to maintain theoretical simplicity instead, which helps uncover new mechanisms affecting consumption patterns and distributional consequences.====As our study compares the incidence of standards with that of taxes, studies on the incidence of environmental taxation are a further relevant body of literature. Those contributions distinguish uses-side and sources-side incidence, namely, the expenditure and the income sides. The uses-side effect is regressive in high-income countries, although this is not generally true in low- and middle-income countries (Sterner, 2012, West and Williams, 2004, Goulder et al., 2019, Liang and Wei, 2012, Dorband et al., 2019). The sources-side can be progressive, particularly when the pricing revenue is progressively redistributed (Rausch et al., 2011, Dissou and Siddiqui, 2014, Goulder and Hafstead, 2017, Williams III et al., 2015). Those effects can potentially offset the uses-side effect, making the overall result progressive (Rausch et al., 2010, Klenert and Mattauch, 2016, Klenert et al., 2018b). Our work uses insights from the tax incidence literature, but has a different focus: comparing the incidence of standards and taxes.====Efficiency analysis of climate policy instruments is the third related strand of literature. Prior research has compared the cost-effectiveness of standards with that of pricing instruments (Fischer, 2001). These studies show that Pigouvian taxes are more cost-effective (see for example Landis et al., 2019), except in special cases: Goulder et al. (2016) present a case in which pre-existing factor market distortions make clean energy standards more cost-effective than pricing, due to the smaller price effect of standards. Fischer and Springborn (2011) use a dynamic model showing that intensity standards generate higher economic output than pricing instruments, when macroeconomic fluctuations are considered. This study follows their approach in formalising emissions taxes and standards, but is motivated with the other increasingly pertinent concern—equity.====The broader significance of our work flows from the fact that most countries are currently not on track to meet global climate targets, whether they regulate carbon emissions by pricing or non-pricing. While the theoretical case for pricing being the most efficient way to decrease emissions is beyond doubt, and revenue redistribution can in theory resolve inequality, citizens have further concerns about carbon pricing: they often care about the immediate regulatory impacts on their budgets and do not appreciate, support or trust the possibility of a complex tax-plus-redistribution scheme (Hammar et al., 2004, Kallbekken et al., 2011, Douenne and Fabre, 2022, Sommer et al., 2022). Once the objective of climate mitigation policy becomes to do “whatever works” to reduce emissions (Goulder, 2020), standards could be desirable, second-best instruments in given governance circumstances. Our contribution is thus related to Stiglitz (2019) and Heutel (2020), who also examine when standards might be preferable from an equity perspective.====The remainder of the article is organised as follows. In Section 2, we present an analytical model for household energy technologies, and show theoretical results on efficiency standards and carbon pricing. The findings are tested with data from the US vehicle market. In Section 3, we describe a model for subsistence and luxury carbon-intensive consumption, and compare intensity standards to carbon pricing with different revenue-redistribution schemes. Section 4 presents further equity dimensions and discusses how those reveal limitations of our results, but also indicate directions for future work.

When does such harsh treatment maximize overall compliance? We consider the role of two factors: responsiveness to penalties and costs of sanctions. A novel insight is that maintaining a credible threat of sanction against infrequent violators is relatively cheap because that threat seldom needs to be backed up. In a Clean Water Act application, the marginal sanction deters ten times as many violations when directed at infrequent violators. On net, this difference is due to a sanction cost effect, not because infrequent violators are marginally more responsive to the threat of punishment.","Regulatory enforcement entails substantial costs. Administrative law agencies spend billions of dollars on investigations, negotiations, and court hearings each year. Sanctions for non-compliance generate significant indirect political economic costs for regulators due to community, industry, and political pressure. Private compliance costs triggered by enforceable environmental, health, and safety laws total one half to two percent of GDP per year, or as much as $360 billion annually. Given the significant public and private costs at stake, understanding the optimal allocation of enforcement resources is a crucial issue for regulation.====This paper considers an unsettled problem for regulators allocating enforcement resources: the treatment of violations committed by frequent versus infrequent violators. Popular wisdom, common notions of fairness, and retributive theories of punishment suggest that regulators should penalize frequent violators’ offenses more severely. Actual practice in environmental, energy, financial, occupational, and health regulation follows this prescription closely.==== Nevertheless, neither extant scholarship nor practice clearly illustrate how a regulator striving to achieve high compliance with costly sanctions and limited resources might actually determine the optimal balance when punishing frequent and infrequent violators.====In this study, we document and explore two factors that influence the optimal regulatory balance when punishing frequent and infrequent violators. The first factor is the enforcement response effect. Intuitively, a regulator seeking to maximize compliance will want to direct marginal enforcement resources towards those facilities most likely to respond to sanctions. Frequent violators may or may not be more responsive, because frequency of violation may be associated with unobserved variation in the structure of compliance costs. The second factor is a sanction cost effect. A key insight here is that it is costlier to the regulator to maintain a given regulatory threat (i.e. a given expected penalty) for frequent violators. This is because sustaining credible enforcement threats against frequent violators requires the regulator to levy costly penalties frequently. In contrast, sustaining a given regulatory threat for infrequent violators may be relatively cheap because the regulator need not ‘back up’ threats with costly sanctions as often.====This paper makes three key contributions. First, we provide a novel characterization of the optimal punishment of violations by frequent and infrequent violators in a realistic regulatory setting. Our evidence illustrates how an agency seeking to minimize violations subject to limited enforcement resources might balance enforcement response and sanction costs across frequent and infrequent violators. Second, we show empirically the relative importance of factors driving optimal decisions using data from a Clean Water Act (CWA) regulatory setting. We use the data to build on a growing public enforcement of law literature empirically measuring deterrence effects of sanctions but go beyond past scholarship by exploring deterrence across frequent and infrequent violators and by using the results to calibrate an optimality condition.==== Third, we illustrate a generalizable framework for regulators considering the optimal punishment of frequent and infrequent violators in their own settings. Rather than assert that our stark CWA results will necessarily generalize, we build an apparatus for stakeholders to form their own conclusions.====We first construct a stylized model that illustrates the optimal regulatory punishment of violations across two types of heterogeneous entities: frequent violators and infrequent violators. The resulting first-order condition shows how enforcement response and sanction cost considerations influence the marginal benefits and marginal opportunity costs of incremental enforcement resources. We use CWA data to calibrate this condition. We focus on water quality because water pollution remains a serious issue in the United States, detected violations by frequent CWA violators are punished severely as a matter of law and practice, and CWA data are observed at high frequencies at the facility-level.==== Our calibration exercise involves identifying three parameters empirically. Under plausible conditions, two of these parameters can be identified directly from moments of our data. We estimate the third, enforcement response, by econometrically exploring regulated facilities’ responses to variation in a proxy for expected penalties. Since the proxy may induce error-in-variables issues and expected penalties might be endogenous, we use a straight-forward application of a split-sample (two-sample) instrumental variable approach for identification. The source of variation in our empirical model is idiosyncratic changes in enforcement intensity plausibly unrelated to the behavior of the facility itself.====Our main empirical finding is that the ratio of marginal costs to marginal benefits (the ‘buck per bang’) is more than ==== times higher for a marginal increase in expected penalty directed towards frequent CWA violators than for infrequent violators. Three implications follow. First, directing marginal enforcement resources towards deterring violations by infrequent violators may improve the regulatory efficiency of maximizing compliance. CWA authorities currently punish violations by frequent violators far more severely than equivalent violations by infrequent violators; on the margin, this is counterproductive if the goal is to maximize compliance. Second, policy initiatives designed to address declining enforcement resources with an even greater focus on frequent violators may move away from optimal resource allocations. This would certainly be true in our CWA context. Third, focusing only on regulated entities' enforcement response – as in the related empirical literature – may suggest misguided policy conclusions. We find that frequent violators respond more strongly in absolute terms to marginal changes in enforcement pressure than infrequent violators. Thus, a regulator focused on enforcement response alone (i.e. the marginal benefits of punishment) may want to treat frequent violators even more harshly (in a relative sense) than present circumstances. But, this behavior ignores sanction cost effects, which in our setting swamp enforcement response effects on the margin.====Our study relates to a broader established literature exploring the optimal treatment of frequent violators, but our regulatory setting differs and the driving forces differ. The key modeling distinction between our paper and the previous literature is sanctions that are costly to the regulator. First, the most basic law and economic models of public enforcement assume social welfare maximizing agencies, zero enforcement costs, and unconstrained penalties (Shavell 2004). In contrast, we study a more realistic regulatory setting where enforcement agencies are mandated to maximize compliance and where enforcement is costly. Second, a criminal enforcement literature derives the optimal treatment of repeat offenders in the presence of personal wealth constraints and exit costs from incarceration (Emons 2003, 2007; Miceli and Bucci 2005). These and other key assumptions are not applicable to our regulatory setting. Third, an enforcement leverage literature (i.e. Landsberger and Meilijson 1982; Harrington 1988; Harford and Harrington 1991; Polinsky and Shavell 1998; Friesen 2003) studies games between regulators and facilities when penalties are costless but legally capped. Our analysis focuses on regulatory settings where enforcement is itself costly and fines never approach statutory maximums. These conditions are common in many regulatory settings. A fourth strand of the frequent violator literature stresses differing costs of compliance revealed by compliance history (Stigler 1970; Rubinstein 1979; Polinsky and Rubinfeld 1991; Chu et al., 2000). Although we share the idea that past behavior may be informative about regulated entities' response to enforcement, the mechanisms by which this heterogeneity drives regulators’ optimal choices differ. Results in the related literature are driven by risks from punishing the innocent or from over-deterrence when gains are socially acceptable. We focus on costly sanctions to the regulator and on legally realistic regulatory objectives.====While our overall point is a broad one, our stylized model and empirical strategy are designed to illustrate this point in the particular context of the Clean Water Act. In this setting, there are significant variations in underlying compliance costs among a relatively small set of facilities. Given long compliance histories we model a common knowledge framework rather than an asymmetric information framework. Moreover, in our setting violations are self-reported, so costs of imposing the sanctions will be significant relative to the costs of violation detection. The framework and analysis here will be less immediately applicable to, for example, regulating worker safety or oil and gas wells across many tens of thousands of entities. In short, we offer a specific implementation and illustration of a broad point in a relatively simple institutional setting. Analyses for other contexts likely require some additional machinery and consideration of simplifying assumptions such as common knowledge.",Costly sanctions and the treatment of frequent violators in regulatory settings,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069622000985,30 September 2022,2022,Research Article,52.0

The profound change in urban mobility patterns supports the often-held view that reducing the number of commuting trips can lower ====. We investigate this optimistic view from a long-run perspective in a monocentric urban model with household-level vehicle choice based on fuel efficiency. In the medium run, fewer trips lead to the choice of less fuel-efficient vehicles. In the long run, lower annual driving costs to the city center additionally lead households to change their location toward longer commuting trips, but cheaper housing, implying an adjustment in the real-estate market. These changes in vehicle choice and the urban form largely eliminate the initial environmental benefits. Binding fuel economy standards completely prevent the medium-run drop in fuel efficiency.","The COVID-19 pandemic paved the way for a global surge in telecommuting. In the United States, the share of people working from home on a regular basis did not increase significantly over the 20 years preceding the pandemic (Mas and Pallais, 2020). On the other hand, during the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, almost half of the working population in the United States were working from home, including 35% who did not telecommute before the pandemic (Brynjolfsson et al., 2020, Bloom, 2020). The potential for telecommuting is even higher: Alipour et al. (2020) find that 56% of jobs in Germany are suitable for at least partial telecommuting. More and more workers and employers familiarize themselves with the required technologies, and the ongoing digitization changes working routines. Furthermore, telecommuting can increase workers’ performance (Bloom et al., 2014) and, thus, provide incentives for employers to adapt it permanently. As a result, the outbreak is likely to have persistent effects on the prevalence of telecommuting in the long run. The profound shift toward telecommuting has raised optimism for emission reduction targets in the transport sector due to reduced commuting. This scenario is often expressed in academic and public debates (Büttner and Breitkreuz, 2020).====Evidently, telecommuting can reduce carbon emissions by reducing fossil-fuel intensive commuting to work. However, this point of view focuses on the short run reduction in work trips and neglects subsequent behavioral responses of consumers. In the longer run, a boost in telecommuting also (i) affects household vehicle choice and (ii) changes the urban form through adjustments in household location and in the housing market. These behavioral responses have consequences for carbon emissions, too. We incorporate these mechanisms and investigate whether telecommuting can reduce carbon emissions in the long run by utilizing a monocentric city model where households choose between vehicles with different fuel efficiency. We show that an increase in the share of telecommuting changes carbon emissions not only by affecting the number of commuting days, but also through changes in vehicle choices in the medium-run and a long-term adjustment of real-estate markets and housing consumption. By calibrating our model parameters with empirical data, we find that these adjustments offset the short-run environmental benefits of telecommuting.====The transport sector is an important source of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). It accounts for around 30 percent of the U.S. energy use and heavily relies on fossil-fuel resources.==== Commuting to work is an important motive for traveling. According to the 2017 figures, commuting to/from work accounts for 30% of total miles of passenger travel at the local level in the U.S.==== Similarly, 28% of the passenger trips in the Netherlands in 2014 were motivated by work related commuting.==== Therefore, reducing the emissions from commuting is an important goal of climate action.====Potential benefits of telecommuting for climate action have been prominent in the public debates, such that an increase in the share of telecommuting for the long-run obviates frequent driving to the city centers which reduces commuting related emissions. For example, in a recent report, Büttner and Breitkreuz (2020) show that telecommuting can save 5 to 18% of emissions from commuting due to these short-run adjustments. In the current paper, we investigate two interacting mechanisms that can diminish the immediate carbon savings that telecommuting can bring about. First, telecommuting affects the vehicle choices. The technology costs of fuel efficient cars only pay off in the long run as they consume less fuel per mile. But the long-term benefits from higher fuel efficiency decrease with fewer trips. Therefore, telecommuters invest less in vehicle fuel economy leading to a dirtier vehicle fleet in the cities. Second, telecommuting affects the housing choices. A structural change toward more telecommuting in the post-covid period can have permanent effects on the urban form. Indeed, pandemics have shaped cities throughout the history. For example, modern sanitation systems emerged as a response to the 19th century cholera outbreaks with enduring effects on urban structure. Similarly, in our framework, willingness to pay for living in the close proximity of city centers diminishes with more telecommuting and the urban landscape flattens out. Hence, telecommuters drive more miles for their daily commute. As a result of these two mechanisms, the magnitude of emission reductions due to an increase in telecommuting is not clear.====We use a monocentric city model==== with endogenous vehicle choices by households. All workers commute to the central business district (CBD) to earn their exogenous income. Households choose the size of their dwelling and the fuel economy of their cars. Their budget available for consumption depends on their annual mobility cost which is determined by the household location, the commuting distance, and the number of trips. Therefore, households with longer commutes and more trips prefer more fuel efficient cars which are cleaner. We incorporate the share of work days spent on working from home in this setting. Therefore, the marginal annual cost of driving decreases for a growing telecommuting share and the vehicle choice takes the telecommuting share into account.====In this setting, we examine how a reduction in the frequency of work-related commuting affects carbon dioxide emissions. The immediate effect of this shock is a decrease in commuting to work, hence in emissions from commuting to work. We find that vehicle-choice and urban-form adjustments in the longer term counteract this immediate reduction in carbon emissions by 84 to 90 percent. The offsetting effect of the urban-form adjustment is between 4 and 6 times larger than the effect of the vehicle-choice adjustment. These results are largely robust to parameter choices and suggest that a permanent increase in the prevalence of telecommuting is not likely to decrease emissions from commuting.====The contribution of our analysis to the literature is to analyze the effect of telecommuting on carbon emissions by considering urban-form adjustments and consumers’ vehicle choices. Our paper contributes to the nascent literature analyzing environmental concerns in an urban-economic modeling framework (e.g. Kim, 2012, Kim, 2016, Borck and Brueckner, 2018, and Marz and Goetzke (2022)). We use a monocentric city model following Brueckner (2007) and incorporate consumers’ vehicle choices. In our model, consumers weight benefits of driving a more fuel-efficient car against its effect on purchasing costs as in Marz and Goetzke (2022), but they also take telecommuting into account which decreases the marginal benefit of fuel efficiency. None of the papers above considers telecommuting. We introduce the share of work days spent on working from home and analyze the interaction of climate policies with telecommuting. We further incorporate several factors which are important for our aim to investigate the quantitative effects of telecommuting, such as housing emissions, non-work trips, and salience of fuel costs. Our work is also related to the literature using spatial models to analyze the local labor market effects of telecommuting. For example, Brueckner et al. (2021) studies the effects of telecommuting on the housing market as workers move to cheaper areas.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we describe our model. We present our main results in Section 3. In Section 4, we discuss various factors that can potentially be important in our modeling framework.

Examples include the US lead phasedown, fuel economy standards for automobiles, renewable portfolio standards, low carbon fuel standards, and—most recently—China's new national carbon market. At the same time, theory and experience with traditional cap-and-trade programs suggest an important role for price limits in the form of floors, ceilings, and reserves. In this paper we develop a simple analytical model to derive the welfare comparison between tradable performance standards and a price-based alternative. This model works out to be a simple variant of the traditional Weitzman prices-versus-quantities result. We use this result to show that substantial gains—perhaps 50% or more when prices are low—could arise from shifting two programs, China's new national carbon market and the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard, to a price mechanism. This finding will generally be true when the ==== in the price under a TPS is larger than 50%. We end with a brief discussion of implementation issues, including consignment auctions.","Tradable performance standards (TPSs) are a popular form of sectoral market-based regulation that require regulated polluters to meet an emissions-per-unit-of-output performance standard on average across the sector. Regulated polluters earn emissions permits, denoted in tons of emissions, based on their level of output multiplied by the performance standard, while acquiring obligations based on their actual emissions. When their emissions rate is below the standard, they end up with a surplus, and when their emissions rate exceeds the standard, they end up with a deficit. Those with a surplus can sell emissions permits to those with a deficit (trading) or hold them for use in the future (banking). TPSs can be conceptualized as a rate-based version of a “mass”-based emissions trading system (ETS). That is, under an ETS the aggregate mass of emissions is fixed; under a TPS the aggregate emissions rate (emissions per output) is fixed. Examples of TPSs include the US lead phasedown, fuel economy standards for automobiles, renewable portfolio standards, low carbon fuel standards, and China's new national carbon market (Newell and Rogers 2003; Farrell and Sperling 2007; Pizer and Zhang 2018;Goulder et al., 2019; Yeh et al., 2020). Most recently, legislative proposals in the US Congress and President Biden's climate plan feature a TPS for the power sector.====Despite the prevalence of TPSs, most of the economic literature focuses on the design of ETSs. An important conclusion in that literature is that managing permit prices (by enforcing either minimum or maximum prices) increases welfare and other benefits by reducing expected compliance costs for regulated polluters (Pizer 2002; Murray et al. 2009; Burtraw et al. 2010; Newell et al. 2005; Wood and Frank, 2011; Roberts and Spence 1976). However, this idea has been rarely discussed in the context of a TPS.====We address this gap in the literature by considering price limits in the context of a TPS, resulting in a hybrid TPS. We first develop a simple analytical model to compare the welfare between a TPS and a fully price-based alternative, the feebate. A feebate can be viewed as a tax on emissions coupled with a revenue-neutral rebate on output—essentially fixing the emissions price rather than the emissions rate.==== Focusing on sector-level policy, we modify the traditional Weitzman (1974) prices-versus-quantities framework by adopting an alternative unit cost function with unit cost shocks in a perfectly competitive market.==== We find that the Weitzman comparative advantage expression continues to hold with a minor adjustment to the marginal benefit slope. In particular, the slope of the marginal benefit schedule increases based on the coefficient of variation in output.====We apply our simple comparative expression to two current TPSs: the new Chinese national carbon market and California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS). Using recent cost estimates for both programs along with other data to calibrate the parameters, we estimate potentially large welfare advantages from using a feebate rather than a TPS. These relative gains (as a share of expected TPS costs) are approximately 50% for the Chinese program and 5% in the California program based on 2021 prices. The more general result is that this relative gain will be large when the coefficient of variation under the TPS is large (for example, greater than one-half).====Finally, we note practical issues regarding the implementation of a price floor in the context of our hybrid TPS. We introduce the idea of a consignment auction with a minimum reserve price that mimics a feebate when the market price reaches the reserve price and then discuss the corresponding implementation issues.====At one level, it may appear that our main contribution is relatively modest, namely replicating Weitzman's result in the context of a rate-based policy. Several papers have considered this type of rate-based-TPS versus price welfare comparison but none provide a simplified, intuitive expression.====In particular, while there is a rich literature comparing different policy designs sometimes focused on uncertain costs (Fishelson 1976; Stavins 1996; Yohe 1978; Hoel and Karp 2002; Newell and Pizer 2003; Weitzman 2018; Pizer and Prest 2020) and sometimes comparing TPSs and feebates (Durrmeyer and Samano 2018; Gillingham 2013; Caparrós et al. 2016; Holland 2012), there is limited work that does both. Compared with those that do compare TPSs and price-based alternatives with uncertain costs, we note three main differences. (1) Quirion (2005) provides a relatively simple expression ==== policies, but does not provide guidance about how much the ranking matters. (2) Zhao (2018), Branger and Quirion (2014), and Newell and Pizer (2008) all provide expressions for the welfare difference, but they are complex and unintuitive. (3) Kellogg (2018) develops a simple expression in an application to fuel economy standards with uncertain gasoline prices, but without explicitly considering benefits (or correlation between this uncertainty and output). In this way, we uniquely provide a simple, generalizable expression for the welfare difference. In the next section, we discuss this literature in relationship to our work in more detail.====One can contrast our simple, stylized approach to detailed simulation modeling in specific applications. Many detailed simulation models do not quantify cost uncertainties, making it difficult to answer questions about policy choice under uncertainty (Durrmeyer and Samano 2018; Gillingham 2013; Caparrós et al. 2016; Holland 2012). This requires adding stochastic elements and the ability to solve for different outcomes with different policies (Nordhaus 2018; Pizer 2002). For the applications we consider here—the California LCFS and Chinese ETS—we leave such modeling for future works. We believe our stylized approach to calculate welfare advantage with a small number of parameters is helpful when there is limited data and a rough estimation is desired.====This result, modest or not, is highly relevant and significant because of the widespread and growing use of sectoral TPSs. The first large-scale TPS, the US lead phasedown, required refineries to decrease the average lead content of all gasoline to 10% of its original level (lead/gallon). A trading program related to the standard was launched in 1982 to allow inter-refinery trading. In 1987, by the time the system terminated, the phasedown successfully met the target and was considered highly cost-effective (Newell and Rogers 2003; Schmalensee and Stavins 2017).====In another example, the early US Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards were updated to allow permit trading in 2012. This program can be thought of as regulating the lifetime greenhouse gas emissions per car sold, assuming every car is driven the same number of miles over its lifetime. The accounting is complicated, but the program effectively allows for trading and banking of permits. The program also includes a maximum price in the form of a per-unit compliance penalty when a manufacturer knowingly or unknowingly exceeds the standard (Klier and Linn 2011; Leard and McConnell 2017).====In the power sector, renewable portfolio standards are a widely used example of TPSs. They set obligations on electricity sellers to acquire a certain proportion of their electricity from renewable energy (denoted as renewable kilowatt-hours as a share of total kilowatt-hours sold). Tradable permits (referred to as Renewable Energy Certificates in the United States or Green Certificates in the European Union) are then generated from eligible renewable energy sources and used for compliance. Such trading programs have been implemented widely in around half of the United States as well as in the United Kingdom and several other European countries (Barbose 2019). Some of these programs include an alternative compliance payment that functions as a maximum price.====The California LCFS and China's new national carbon market are two recent TPS examples that we discuss at length later in the paper as numerical applications of our theoretical results. On the horizon, several policy proposals in the United States have featured a clean energy standard requiring a certain percentage of retail electricity sales to come from sources with zero or low emissions. For example, H.R. 7516 would transition the US electric sector to 100% clean energy by 2050 (DeGette 2020). Even more ambitiously, President Biden's climate plan features a clean energy standard intended to achieve carbon-pollution-free energy in electricity generation by 2035 (Biden 2020).====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the existing literature comparing price and quantity market-based policies in the context of rate-based instruments (e.g., feebates and TPSs). Section 3 develops our model and derives the comparative advantage expression for feebates versus TPSs. Section 4 estimates welfare gains earned by switching from a TPS to a feebate in the context of California's LCFS and China's new carbon trading program. Section 5 briefly discusses the way to integrate price floors into a TPS.

Higher price premiums are also observed in first floor units, units closer to rivers, and in areas where floodwaters are expected to exceed 2 m, while rental units designed as temporary housing received no premium. Finally, we find the capitalized gains from the apartment rental market are small in comparison to premiums paid by homeowners and commercial renters, where prices increased by 11.7% and 9.2% respectively. Taken altogether, the Gokayama Dam provides $146.5 million in downstream benefits each year, though it is unclear how long these price effects will last.","Despite 41% of its population living in flood-prone areas, Japan manages flood risk well thanks in part to its extensive network of flood defense (Kundzewicz et al., 2014). At the center of this defense are more than 2500 dams nationwide which control water levels across thousands of streams, rivers, and lakes. Many of these dams need to be repaired soon as 24% of Japanese flood control dams are more than 50 years old, which is considered a critical threshold of when stress begins to show and action needs to be taken (Perera et al., 2021). The decision to rebuild or reinvest in dams is difficult as policymakers need to weigh the benefits of flood control with the cost of replacement and potentially adding to the $11 trillion national debt (Ministry of Finance, 2021).====To complicate matters, public opinion on dams is divided, and recent controversies surrounding dam construction have sprouted anti-dam movements. One particularly controversial project is the Yamba Dam, which is located 130 km northwest of Tokyo. Construction of the dam started in 1967 despite fierce opposition from locals who wanted to save the area from being submerged. The project was once cancelled in 2009 to curb public spending but later restarted in 2012 due to a change in the national ruling party. Finally, in 2019 the dam was completed billions of dollars over budget and decades beyond the original timeline. The mismanagement of the Yamba Dam led to a public opinion that dams are a symbol of wasteful government spending and caused many politicians to run on dam-free platforms in the 2000s (Mishima, 2015).====Climate change may tip the scales towards greater investment in water infrastructure, despite these concerns, as extreme weather events are expected to become more common (Mizuta et al., 2017; Hoshino et al., 2020). In Tokyo, for instance, the probability of having a 250+ mm rainfall day is predicted to at least double by the end of the 21st century (Mizuta et al., 2017). With greater rainfall comes greater flood risk. The national, prefectural, and local governments have responded by updating floodplain maps (MLIT, 2015), raising river banks (Ikeuchi, 2012), improving emergency warning systems (Japan Meteorological Agency, 2021), and building upstream flood protection. The extent to which residents value these precautionary measures, however, is not well understood.====In this study, we investigate how single-family home values and residential and commercial rents responded to the completion of the Gokayama Dam in Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan and its subsequent testing four months later caused by the arrival of Typhoon Prapiroon. We argue the latter event induced floodplain residents to update their perceptions of flood risk and use this as a natural experiment to causally identify the relationship between flood protection and downstream real estate values. We use the former event, on the other hand, to test whether objective changes in flood risk are also capitalized.====From this analysis we make three contributions to the flood risk literature. We are the first study to examine how improvements in flood protection, specifically the completion of an upstream dam, influence real estate markets. Although capitalization of coastal defense is a well-studied topic (McNamara et al., 2015; Qiu and Gopalakrishnan, 2018), little is known in regards to the benefits conferred by upstream dams. This may be due to a lack of awareness as dams are often built several kilometers away from the area it protects. Second, we focus on how apartment renters respond to changes in flood risk. Renters are an important stakeholder group in Japan but are typically unaccounted for in hedonic applications due to data limitations. They are also likely to value flood protection differently than homeowners due to their lower level of risk. Finally, we contextualize these results by examining how flood protection is capitalized within the commercial rental and single-family housing market. Business owners are another important stakeholder group concerned with mitigating flood risk but are often excluded from hedonic applications, while several studies have priced flood risk using housing transactions (Hallstrom and Smith, 2005; Kousky, 2010; Bin and Landry, 2013; Ortega and Taṣpınar, 2018; Georgic and Klaiber, 2021). The valuations we recover from all three real estate markets provide a more holistic understanding of the benefits conferred from flood protection.====Using a difference-in-difference estimator and a rich dataset of rental transactions from Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan (2015–2019), we find apartment rental prices increased by 1.8% if they were protected by the recently constructed Gokayama Dam relative to rental units in other floodplains. Capitalization also occurred in commercial rentals and single-family housing values, but to an even greater extent, increasing by 9.2% and 11.7% respectively. This price increase is only observed after Typhoon Prapiroon hit western Japan and tested the dam, suggesting that the arrival of Typhoon Prapiroon altered renters' perception of flood risk while the completion of the dam did not. Higher flood protection premiums are also observed in first floor apartments, apartments closer to rivers, and in areas where floodwaters are expected to exceed 2 m, while no premium is observed in apartments designed as temporary housing. Overall, the aggregate benefits from the apartment ($11.3 million per year), commercial ($56.8 million per year), and single-family housing market ($78.4 million) cover more than the annualized cost of the Gokayama Dam ($27.9 million per year), though it is not clear how long these benefits will last and whether they're enough to cover the total cost of the dam.",Holding back the storm: Dam capitalization in residential and commercial property values,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069622000857,14 September 2022,2022,Research Article,55.0

The most common time-variant prices are time-of-use (TOU) prices, which vary by hour of day, and event-based prices, which take effect during idiosyncratic “critical” events. We present evidence on the effects of TOU prices and event-based prices when implemented in isolation versus simultaneously. The key finding is that time-variant prices reduce demand during critical events by 19% when event-based pricing is implemented in isolation, but only 5% when TOU and event-based prices are implemented together, despite both price schemes creating similar financial incentives. The results suggest that price complexity may dull consumer responsiveness to price signals.","Electric utilities are increasingly using time-variant pricing programs, in which households pay different prices depending on when electricity is consumed, to shape residential demand. Shifting demand is an important element in the transitional path toward further integrating low-carbon renewable resources into the electric system because it can help align consumer demand with the supply of intermittent renewable sources of power. For example, time-variant pricing programs can be used to shift consumption toward periods of elevated solar and wind generation and away from periods of elevated coal and natural gas-based generation.==== While time-variant pricing has historically been used sparingly, the installation of automatic metering infrastructure (“smart meters”), the increased prevalence of intermittent renewables, and increased adoption of electric vehicles have sparked broad interest in recent years. Many utilities across the country are considering or actively implementing broad deployment of time-variant pricing programs. The number of consumers on time-variant pricing globally is expected to rise to 75 million by 2025, in part because jurisdictions, such as California and New York, are requiring utilities to shift toward time-variant rates (Feldman, 2018).====Time-variant prices can be implemented in a variety of ways. Real-time pricing, in which prices continuously reflect the costs of generation, would best align prices with the costs of generation, thereby creating large efficiency gains (Borenstein, 2005). However, due partly to fears about price volatility, utilities and consumers have been reluctant to embrace such programs. In contrast, time-of-use (TOU) pricing, in which consumers pay different prices for electricity depending on the time of day when electricity is used regardless of system conditions, has received relatively greater acceptance. TOU programs typically set a different per kWh price for electricity depending on whether the electricity is consumed during “peak” (e.g., 3:00 p.m.- 8:00 p.m.) or “off-peak” periods. A shortcoming of TOU pricing is that it is not responsive to idiosyncratic events that affect electricity supply or demand, such as unusual weather. Event-based pricing schemes, including critical peak prices (CPP) or critical peak rebates (CPR),==== are designed to address such events. Event-based programs provide a large per-kWh incentive for customers to conserve electricity during “critical” events, which utilities have traditionally called when demand is predicted to be unusually high. With critical peak prices, consumers are charged a higher price for electricity consumed during critical events. With critical peak rebates, consumers receive a rebate for each kWh they conserve during critical events relative to their reference usage.====TOU pricing and event-based pricing have been studied in isolation,==== but little research has examined how these two types of pricing programs interact when implemented simultaneously. This is an important shortcoming because there are potential benefits to implementing the programs simultaneously. TOU prices are oriented toward creating consistent shifts in daily demand patterns, whereas event-based programs are designed to shift demand in response to idiosyncratic events. Both types of demand changes are helpful for decreasing peak loads and reducing reliance on generators at the end of the dispatch curve, which tend to be inefficient and powered by fossil fuels, and are potentially important tools as the supply of intermittent renewable generation expands. Recognizing the possible benefits of using TOU and event-based programs in tandem, utilities have begun implementing time-variant pricing programs that include both elements (e.g., Consumers Energy’s “Peak Power Savers” program in Michigan).====While there is theoretical appeal to using TOU and event-based pricing in combination, it is unclear how well the two pricing schemes will work in combination in practice, in part because consumers have been shown to respond in unpredictable ways in the face of multiple financial incentives. For example, Chetty et al. (2009) show that consumers do not fully account for sales taxes when purchasing goods for which the full price is both the posted price and the sales tax. Similarly, Hossain and Morgan (2006) present evidence that consumers are less sensitive to shipping costs than to posted prices in eBay auctions. As described in DellaVigna (2009), this behavior is consistent with consumers having limited attention and being forced to develop simplifying heuristics for decision-making.====Predicting consumer decision-making related to financial incentives in the power sector has proven particularly difficult. For example, while only indirectly related to time-variant prices, there is evidence that consumers are weakly motivated by financial incentives that operate through investments in energy efficiency, potentially because these investments require consumers to undertake relatively complex decision-making that involves consideration of many factors (e.g., upfront costs, future prices, projected usage, and non-monetary factors, such as the inconvenience of a new installation).==== The layering of TOU and event-based pricing programs may be a case in the power sector where consumer decision-making is especially challenging because there are multiple price signals and the signals are intermittently in effect across time.==== This paper evaluates how consumers respond to time-variant pricing, focusing especially on the effectiveness of layering time-of-use pricing with event-based pricing. The specific types of time-variant pricing that are evaluated include TOU pricing (in isolation), critical peak rebates (in isolation), and TOU and critical peak rebates offered simultaneously (“hybrid pricing”). The analysis is based on data from a field experiment run by a vertically-integrated electric utility in the western U.S.==== The treatments were initiated in the summer of 2016 and included about 3500 households.==== The key finding is that, during summer critical events, the use of rebates in isolation is highly effective and reduces consumption by 19 percent. In contrast, hybrid pricing schemes that create a nearly identical incentive to conserve electricity during events are much less effective, only reducing consumption by about 5 percent.==== ====,====How should our findings – especially the reduced effectiveness of hybrid pricing – be interpreted? We posit that the key results are driven by the complexity of hybrid pricing and the response of consumers to this complexity.==== Hybrid pricing can be considered the most complex form of time-variant pricing we evaluate based on either of the two primary adjective definitions for “complex”, which are “involving a lot of different but related parts” and “difficult to understand or find an answer to because of having many different parts” ((Cambridge Dictionary, 2020). In the context of these definitions, hybrid pricing involves the most “parts” relative to TOU-only or event-only versions of time-variant pricing because it includes two time-variant pricing components, as opposed to one. Relatedly, as we discuss and show graphically in Section 3, hybrid pricing creates the most changes in the marginal price of electricity across hours of the day. Households on the hybrid price plans we evaluate experienced four to six changes in the marginal price of electricity on event days; whereas households on the CPR-only price plans experienced only two changes in the marginal price of electricity on event days. With respect to being “difficult to understand”, we present survey evidence in Section 5 that customers on hybrid pricing had weaker comprehension of how time-variant prices operate than customers on either type of stand-alone pricing.====If customers indeed found hybrid pricing to be more complex, then our findings, while initially surprising, are consistent with predictions from the literature on behavioral economics. Specifically, this literature has found that, when forced to make even mildly complex decisions, consumers sometime choose to simply maintain the status quo (Kahneman et al., 1991, Samuelson and Zeckhauser, 1988, Clerides and Courty, 2017, Earl, 1990). In our context, the status quo would manifest as reduced effectiveness at changing consumption patterns, which is what we document. Our findings complement existing work from laboratory experiments that shows that complex prices can confuse consumers (Kalayci and Potter, 2011), that complex marketplaces narrow the focus of consumers (Huck et al., 2016), that complex prices negatively impact consumer decision making (Huck and Wallace, 2015); and that consumers dislike complexity in choice settings with uncertainty (Sonsino et al., 2002).====While the findings are not a general endorsement of any specific type of time-variant pricing and caution should be taken when applying the results to other settings, they support the notion that price interventions in the electricity sector should value simplicity and that the optimal pricing structure may be different than what might be prescribed absent behavioral considerations.==== This conclusion is in line with existing qualitative work that indicates that simplicity is an important attribute in designing interventions in the energy sector (Hobman et al., 2016). It is also related to findings from other settings that show that simplicity can enhance the effectiveness of policy interventions for obtaining desirable outcomes, such as increasing the uptake of tax benefits (Bhargava and Manoli, 2015), improving behavior related to public health (Matjasko et al., 2016), increasing application rates for college financial aid (Bettinger et al., 2012, Dynarski and Scott-Clayton, 2006), and improving understanding of financial products (Brown et al., 2021). An implication of the findings is that policymakers and utility managers in the energy sector should weigh the benefits of adding price complexity – which can enable financial incentives to better align with the social costs of generation – against the costs, which may include dampened consumer responsiveness. More broadly, there is increasing interest among policymakers in employing or mandating new types of prices in various sectors (e.g., congestion pricing during periods of elevated traffic, dynamic curb pricing to address the increasing use of ride-hailing services, changes in the prices observed and paid by consumers in the health sector, initiatives to reduce the “hidden” fees in cable and wireless bills). Consideration of price complexity may be important as policymakers and other actors evaluate alternative types of pricing in a wide array of new settings.",How do consumers respond to price complexity?

AOCs are heavily polluted locations identified as priorities for restoration under the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement (GLWQA) between the United States and Canada. Since the signing of the GLWQA, AOCs have undergone cleanup actions that could encourage local redevelopment and raise nearby property values. This paper focuses on the Milwaukee Estuary AOC and estimates property owner willingness to pay as well as potential differences in willingness to pay for sediment remediation using a sorting model and home sales data before and after cleanup. Results indicate that home prices near the water increased significantly and that remediation did not change pre-existing ==== generally favoring higher-income, predominantly white households through a process of demographic re-sorting.","Water pollution is one of the world’s greatest environmental concerns. When asked about environmental problems, ninety-three percent of people globally report being either very or somewhat concerned about water pollution, more than the percentages for air pollution and climate change (GlobeScan, 2009). In the United States, residents are more concerned about water pollution than nearly any other topic, including medical bills and terrorism, and in Canada two-thirds of residents report being very concerned about water quality (Chapman University, 2018, Gallup, 2019). Surveys like these reveal that public concerns about water quality remain elevated despite decades of strict pollution control regulations and cleanup efforts. Lawmakers, public officials and environmental organizations therefore face continuous pressure to address water pollution problems.====Economists have responded to these concerns and the growth in pollution control policies by generating information about the economic benefits and costs of cleaning up water. Since the 1970s, the United States has devoted 0.8 percent of GDP to control water pollution (Keiser and Shapiro, 2019). A large literature examines the economic benefits of these efforts, in terms of residential activities (e.g. Tuttle and Heintzelman, 2015, Poor et al., 2001 and Poor et al. (2007)), health (e.g. McConnell and Rosado (2000) and Dwight et al. (2005)), and recreation (e.g. Carson and Mitchell (1993) and Bockstael et al. (1987)). Nevertheless, there remains a pressing need for research on the value of clean water, particularly research examining cleanup actions, as recent evaluations have thrown the welfare consequences of cleanup into question (Keiser et al., 2019).====In this paper, I examine whether recent actions to restore water quality through the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement (GLWQA) have yielded benefits in one part of the Great Lakes. The GLWQA is a commitment between the United States and Canada to rid pollution from the Great Lakes—a water-rich area that, for many people, epitomizes the potential of pollution control and remediation programs to rehabilitate water resources. To achieve this, the GLWQA has focused water pollution control and remediation actions on heavily polluted locations known as Areas of Concern (AOCs). Canada and the United States have collectively spent $23 billion cleaning up these areas (Hartig et al., 2020). I estimate the benefit of cleaning up part of the Milwaukee Estuary AOC using home sales data before and after a major cleanup event. My identification strategy exploits variation in where remediation occurred to attribute household location decisions and willingness to pay to improvements in the AOC.====This paper makes two novel contributions to research on the economics of water quality. First, it estimates the benefit of an AOC remediation action ex post. For two decades, the standard approach has relied on property value hedonics and sales data collected in the period before cleanup. To estimate the benefits of remediation ex ante, economists have modeled proximity to the AOC as a disamenity in the hedonic price function (Stoll et al., 2002, Braden et al., 2004, Patunru et al., 2007, Braden et al., 2008, McMillen, 2017, Isely et al., 2018). A weakness of this approach is that unobserved attributes could be correlated with proximity to the AOC. To get around this endogeneity problem, several papers have used choice experiments or combined actual and hypothetical property sales data (Chattopadhyay et al., 2005, Phaneuf et al., 2013). However, the accuracy of these estimates – whether based on distance and actual home sales, or on hypothetical cleanup – remains unclear. This paper helps fill this information gap by measuring the effect of cleanup using pre and post home sales and spatial variation in remediation. This pre-post, control-treated comparison reduces the channels of bias that could have affected prior hedonic estimates. My approach is also unique in that it estimates the benefits of cleanup using a residential sorting model. Sorting models are well-suited to measuring the effects of water quality on residential locations and willingness to pay because they combine information about housing characteristics with the structure of the choice process, allowing them to account for heterogeneous preferences while predicting the outcomes of large shocks (Kuminoff et al., 2013). Yet little prior work has used sorting models to value water quality improvements.====Second, this paper attempts to shine new light on underlying inequities by examining whether water quality improvements trigger residential re-sorting that alters the income and racial composition of nearby neighborhoods. There is growing concern among community advocates and government officials that cleaning up pollution tends to benefit some groups more than others due to differences in income, political power, and discrimination. Cleanup actions that ignore these structural factors can fail to correct inequitable exposure and contribute to environmental gentrification (Banzhaf et al., 2019, Melstrom and Mohammdi, 2021). Environmental gentrification occurs when environmentally motivated migration patterns alter the demographic mix in a neighborhood, for example when rich replace poor households due to differences in budget constraints, affordability, and willingness to pay (Banzhaf and Walsh, 2008). This kind of sorting means that disparities in pollution exposure (e.g. between rich and poor households) can persist even if cleanup occurs in disadvantaged neighborhoods, which can fuel environmental justice concerns. Testing for heterogeneous sorting is relatively straightforward with a sorting model and data on buyer characteristics. My approach models income and race-based sorting on cleanup and, hence, potential differences in willingness to pay, which is important because finding lower willingness to pay among low income buyers or buyers of color would suggest that the benefits of cleanup are not equitably distributed. By looking for evidence of demographic sorting on cleanup, this paper contributes to an expanding pool of research on the distributional consequences of environmental policies (Banzhaf, 2012, Banzhaf et al., 2019, Depro et al., 2015, Bakkensen and Ma, 2020).====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

Using a sample of government land sales along two sides of the heating service line in China, we first show land parcels transacted in the south in the winter are associated with an average ==== of 7.1%, compared to transactions in the north where heating service is provided. We discuss three possible explanations, including projection bias, incorrect belief, and salience bias. We find adverse weather such as low temperature and extreme weather may trigger the mispricing in the absence of the heating service, lending support to the projection bias. Moreover, our empirical investigations suggest the local government, as the only land seller, responds weakly to such biases. We also provide suggestive evidence that individual buyers in the south can learn from prior experience.","The increasing frequency of adverse weather has raised concerns of both researchers and policy makers. A growing strand of literature tries to bridge adverse weather conditions with human behaviors (Carleton and Hsiang, 2016, Hsiang et al., 2017, Hsiang and Kopp, 2018). Among them, some investigate rational responses to adverse weather, where people may adjust their labor supply (Graff Zivin and Neidell, 2014), energy consumption (Deschênes and Greenstone, 2011) and healthcare utilization (Agarwal et al., 2021), while others focus on irrational responses to adverse weather such as biased purchase behaviors on cloth and car (Conlin et al., 2007, Busse et al., 2015), etc. Yet, such weather effects are less documented in long-term investment decisions such as buying houses and land parcels.====In this paper, we exploit how a unique setting of the district heating service in China, which provides an indoor shield against adverse weather for residences in the north, affects land prices in the primary transaction market. The district heating system is a national-level project that has lasted for over 60 years, and aims to provide heating service for residential and commercial properties in northern China during the winter period. Northern China traces the Qinling mountains and Huai River, where the temperature drops to below freezing during the winter. Therefore, from mid-November to the next mid-March, cities in the north enjoy warm temperatures indoors, while cities in the south have no access to the district heating service. If land buyers are rational, their willingness to pay on land parcels should not be affected by the presence of the heating service ====. In other words, buyers’ valuation on land should not be different in heating and non-heating seasons, all else being equal.====Our empirical analysis employs the land transaction records in the primary land market in China from 2007 to 2016, where the sellers are local governments and the buyers are individuals, firms, and other entities. We utilize the hedonic pricing model, which is widely used to quantitatively estimate the values of houses and land parcels and assumes a rational buyer should accurately evaluate the fair value of each attribute of a housing unit or land parcel.====Our identification strategy compares the transacted prices right above (north) and below (south) the heating service line, before and after the provision of the heating service. We first show the price trend is parallel in the south and north in the non-heating months (April to October). However, the price in the south significantly declines after the provision of the heating service in the north. In a difference-in-differences (DiD) framework, we quantify that the price discount in the south in the heating period is approximately 7.1% of the unit price. Such an effect is stronger for the land transactions with smaller area and land purchased by individual buyers. Moreover, as a falsification test, the price discount is only present in residential and commercial land with coverage of the heating service, and is economically insignificant for industrial and public land.====We consider a range of robustness checks to address potential concerns. We first mitigate the concern that the contract date may not be the reported transaction date by dropping a certain number of days before and after the heating service, and then, we control for weather conditions that might affect the land transactions. In addition, we allow the willingness to pay on all land attributes/amenities to vary over the season and across the heating border, and we allow for the willingness to pay on land attributes/amenities to differ by individual or corporate buyers across the heating line. Our results hold through different specifications above. Moreover, we attempt to alleviate the concern of the possible selection issue on unobservables. In practice, we test the robustness of our baseline result under some bounding exercises, including a Lee bound model (Lee, 2009) and a Bracketing bound model (Hasegawa et al., 2019, Ye et al., 2021). Our baseline result remains significant under these bounding exercises.====We then discuss several possible explanations for our results, including projection bias, incorrect belief, and salience bias. The projection bias, which alleges that people may mispredict their future utility based on their current status,==== predicts adverse weather such as low temperature and extreme weather may trigger the mispricing in the absence of the heating service. The argument of the incorrect belief is that if current conditions cause individuals to mispredict futures, individuals may also fail to predict future state-dependent utility in similar ways (Li et al., 2011). That is, in our case, the cold weather today might induce individuals to incorrectly believe cold weather is more likely to happen and last long into the future, and such belief may cause the mispricing. Another major confounding explanation is the salience theory, which states people may disproportionally and irrationally pay attention to certain features of a product in certain situations (Pryor and Kriss, 1977, Alba and Chattopadhyay, 1986, Qin et al., 2019). In our context, the salience refers to the absence of the district heating policy in the southern cities, compared with their neighboring cities immediately to the north of the heating line. Our empirical results provide suggestive support for the projection bias.====Although most of the prior discussion centers around the price effect on the demand side, in an empirical set-up such as this, we need to understand the supply-side responses as well and whether the price effect picks up such responses. On top of the transacted sample, we further collect a complete set of failed transaction records with land attributes, documenting that the land-supply failure does not show significant seasonality between the south and north. Then, to further ensure the selection on transaction likelihood is not a big concern, we test the baseline regression in a Heckman two-stage model, and the baseline result remains robust. Combining the transacted and failed data together into a sample of land supply, we show that in aggregate, the land supply is 1.8% lower in the south during the winter, than in the north. Such a result suggests that local government in the south may be aware of the lower prices in winter and thus reduce land supply in winter. However, the coefficient is small in the economic magnitude and insignificant in the statistics. To mitigate the concern that such a supply response would bias our main results, in a set of composition analyses, we show land attributes in the north and south are not significantly different over the season, and our results remain robust to excluding observations with possible changes in each attribute.====After documenting and justifying the mispricing in the land market, we further investigate whether market participants can correct their cognitive biases through repeated transactions. First, we show the baseline effect only exists among individual buyers (a price discount of 8.5%), and the effect for corporate buyers, who are more sophisticated, is statistically and economically insignificant (1.9%). Second, our results indicate the repeated individual buyers in non-heating cities are more likely to learn from their previous biases and compared to the first transaction, their subsequent transactions are more likely to happen during the heating period. Third, the documented land mispricing is stronger in cities with lower education levels. In other words, it suggests land buyers in cities with higher levels of human capital are less likely to have behavioral bias. Collectively, these findings are supportive evidences for the learning process or “de-bias” process (Busse et al., 2015).====Moreover, we discuss air pollution created by the heating policy as a possible confounder to our baseline result. In theory, The disamenity effect and the cognitive impairment brought by the air pollution could possibly affect the transaction price. To empirically investigate whether the baseline effect is induced by air pollution, we include air quality into the regression. We find that interactive effects of daily or weekly level of air pollution on land price are negligible, and the effect of temperature remains strong. Overall, our results suggest that air pollution may not be the underlying mechanism of the baseline effect.====This study contributes to the literature in several ways. First, we contribute to the rich literature on the economic consequences of adverse weather. On the one hand, adverse weather would trigger people’s rational responses. Graff Zivin and Neidell (2014) find high temperature reduces hours worked in industries with high exposure to climate and reduces time of outdoor leisure for the nonemployed; Agarwal et al. (2021) find extremely high temperature is related to inpatients and morbidity in China. On the other hand, there might exist irrational responses to adverse weather conditions. For instance, Conlin et al. (2007) find that a decline in the order-date temperature of 30 °F is associated with an increase in the refund of cold-weather items. Specifically, we add to this strand of literature by showing that the demand for the heating service may be influenced by behavioral factors, in particular when interacted with extreme weather.====Second, we are also among the first to document behavior biases in land purchase, and the magnitude of the mispricing from such biases is large. Unlike purchasing winter clothes or a car during adverse weather conditions (Conlin et al., 2007, Busse et al., 2015), biases in the real estate market are much more costly to correct. We discuss several possible mechanisms, including projection bias, incorrect belief, and salience bias. More importantly, we show people can learn from the bias, which is related to an open question raised by Loewenstein et al. (2003) at the end of their paper: to what degree can people learn from behavioral biases as their experience increases? Consistent with the findings presented by Boven et al. (2003), who claim people learn to make increasingly optimal decisions as they repeat actions with a single commodity, we find some evidence that individual acquirers in non-heating cities shift their purchase-season decision to winter as they engage in multiple transactions in the land market.====Third, our results also contribute to the ongoing literature on the cost–benefit analysis of the heating service. Most previous research investigates how heating service affects housing value based on rational assumptions (Sandler, 2018, Myers, 2019, Shen et al., 2021). For instance, Shen et al. (2021) show that residences with an air source heat pump enjoy a 4.3–7.1% price premium in the U.S. Moreover, deviating from prior studies that exploit geographic discontinuity of district heating service as a proxy for air pollution (Almond et al., 2009, Chen et al., 2013a, Ebenstein et al., 2017, Ito and Zhang, 2020), we highlight the function of heating facilities as a shield against adverse weather for residences in north China during the winter. Thus, we depart from previous literature in the sense that we detect unintended behavioral responses to different temperature perceptions resulting from the heating service.====We organize the remainder of this article as follows. In the next section, we briefly introduce the institutional background of the land market and heating policy in China. Section 3 describes the data and methodology used in the article. Section 4 lays out our empirical findings on the effect of heating policy on land price, and investigates a range of possible rational or behavioral explanations for the results.

This paper investigates the role of incremental deregulation of natural gas wellhead prices–a regulatory price ceiling–on U.S. air quality from 1972–1985, by influencing the incentive to move relatively cleaner natural gas across state lines. The results indicate that relaxing (raising) natural gas wellhead price caps is not associated with significant declines in national average sulfur dioxide (====). However, disaggregating by state’s natural gas importing status reveals that relaxing wellhead price caps was associated with significant increases in ==== concentrations among natural gas exporting states but significant relative reductions among natural gas importing states, and that the reductions in ==== concentrations were significantly larger for larger volume importers. Extended analysis indicates a strong relationship between relaxing wellhead price caps and relative increases in natural gas usage by importing states, and that increases of natural gas in state’s energy portfolios were associated with significant reductions in ==== concentrations, associated in turn with annual reductions in mortality valued between $0.8 and $2.1 billion.","Natural gas is well known to be a relatively clean fossil fuel, in comparison to other commonly used alternatives such as coal or petroleum. In addition, technological upgrading and input substitution decisions of firms are sensitive to changes in relative input costs (Linn and Muehlenbachs, 2018, Linn et al., 2014, Baylis et al., 2014). Recent booms in U.S. natural gas production, driven by exploration and technological advances (particularly widespread adoption of hydraulic fracturing techniques), have contributed to a significant and relatively rapid increase in U.S. natural gas consumption (rising from 21.7 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) in 2006 to 27.1 Tcf in 2017 (Energy Information Agency)) and fuel substitution, contributing to a slowdown in airborne emissions associated with fossil fuel combustion, including sulfur dioxide (====) and greenhouse gas emissions.==== These recent changes have arisen in a time of comparatively low market regulation and relatively interconnected regional markets. This has not always been the case.==== Historical concerns regarding producer market power led to much greater regulatory oversight of almost all aspects of interstate natural gas markets, beginning in the 1930s and then greatly expanded by the Supreme Court in 1954, explicitly requiring oversight of natural gas prices by federal regulators (for natural gas sold across state lines====). Gradual relaxation of those price controls up through the early 1990s set the stage for current market outcomes, in addition to driving important spillover effects along the way.====A large literature in economics has addressed the welfare consequences of price ceilings in various industries, including housing, telecommunication, healthcare, and energy.==== This paper concentrates on the environmental spillover consequences accompanying the regulation and incremental deregulation of prices in the U.S. natural gas market. Understanding the historical context as well as the indirect or unintended environmental effects of policy changes that affect the inter-regional availability of natural gas–and state’s overall energy portfolios–is key to setting net-beneficial rules and policies,==== particularly with regard to oil and natural gas pipeline authorizations or other commercial and residential policies affecting energy use, as regulatory decisions influence capital expenditures that can lock in particular outcomes for extended periods of time.====As policy makers–first the Federal Power Commission (FPC) and then later direct Congressional legislation–deregulated (increased) natural gas wellhead price caps (WHPCs) at different points and by various amounts throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the legal price limit on gas sold across state lines was increased. These policy changes served to raise the incentive to explore for additional gas reserves and also to move natural gas, a relatively clean fossil fuel, across state lines into net-importing states by contractually committing more gas into interstate markets. To the extent that relaxing WHPCs drove an increase in the mix of natural gas in state’s energy portfolio, the change would likely contribute to a (unintended) cleanup of those state’s air quality. The primary analysis in this paper examines the potential spillover relationship between U.S. ==== concentrations and the incremental deregulation of WHPCs. To control for various confounding factors, the primary analysis incorporates county fixed effects and year trends and time period indicators, as well as numerous time-varying variables at the county and state level, including measures of direct and indirect environmental regulation and pollution control.====The results provide no evidence, on average, that relaxing (raising) natural gas WHPCs contributed to significantly lower ==== concentrations nationally. However, national analysis masks a marked difference in outcomes across regions by natural gas importing status. Disaggregating the analysis by state’s natural gas importing status reveals that relaxing WHPCs was associated with significant increases in ==== among exporting states (as they were incentivized to commit more gas out of state). In contrast, relaxing WHPCs was associated with significant relative declines in ==== among importing states (as the rising WHPC, and resulting greater availability of natural gas by exporters, facilitated a relative shift in their energy portfolio towards natural gas). Across the 14 year sample period, the regulated WHPCs were ultimately raised from $0.23 to $3.43 per thousand cubic feet. Estimates from the primary analysis indicate that on average, from 1972–1985, controlling for overall trends, doubling the effective WHPC predicts six percent of the observed ==== declines, across counties monitored by the EPA in natural gas importing states. Further analysis indicates that the relative declines in ==== concentrations were larger for states that imported larger volumes of natural gas.====I follow up the baseline analysis by quantifying and then valuing the predicted mortality consequences for affected populations of the increase in pollution among exporting states and the relative cleanup among importing states associated with relaxing the WHPCs. This welfare analysis indicates that relaxing WHPCs underlies an increase in ==== concentrations among natural gas exporting states associated with an additional 56 deaths each year, per 100,000 persons. The same policy change is associated with reduction in ==== concentrations among importing states associated with avoiding 23 deaths each year per 100,000. However, since the affected population densities were so much larger among the historically importing states, at the time, the overall welfare effect represents a substantial net-gain of between $0.8 and $2.1 billion.====The estimated results contribute to two related research areas. First, the findings contribute to the investigation into the primary factors driving long run changes in U.S. regional air pollution. An important vein of research has shown that reductions in industry emissions intensity is the channel through which most declines in both U.S. and European industrial emissions are working in recent years, as firms enter, exit, and update their productions processes (Holladay and LaPlue, 2021, Brunel, 2017, Levinson, 2015, Levinson, 2009). However, general agreement regarding the policies, economic changes, or specific firm decisions driving these declines remains elusive.====The role played by environmental regulation is, perhaps, the most plausible ==== explanation for observed air quality improvements, and indirect analysis does lend support to the importance of environmental regulation (Shapiro and Walker, 2018, Bistline, 2014, Cole et al., 2005). However, direct estimates of the role of U.S. air-quality regulations (legislated by the Clean Air Act and subsequent amendments) in driving air quality improvements have tended to find only limited environmental effects that vary by pollutant. For example, Greenstone (2004) analyzes the effects of county-level regulation on ==== concentrations, and finds insignificant evidence of the role of regulation. More recent work highlights the complexity inherent with estimating the role of oftentimes overlapping environmental regulations (Novan, 2017) and the importance of accounting for geographic and temporal variation in stringency (Sheriff et al., 2018). Work investigating the role of the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments that gave rise to the Acid Rain Program (an example of an ==== cap-and-trade system) in the North-Eastern U.S. (see discussions in Schmalensee and Stavins, 2013, Ron Chan et al., 2018) has generally found that the regulatory approach was a broad success, both in terms of reductions in ==== and program costs, though recent work by Henry III et al. (2011) indicates that the once population concentrations and associated marginal damages are incorporated, the apparent gains may be reversed. Investigation of the role of environmental regulation has found a stronger link to the declines of particulate matter (Chay and Greenstone, 2013), and ozone (Henderson, 1996, Henderson and Becker, 2000), coinciding with recent direct evidence that Canadian environmental regulations are responsible for a significant share of the declines in nitrous oxides (NOx, an ozone component) and particulate matter (Najjar and Cherniwchan, 2018).====The present analysis contributes to the general investigation into the causes underlying national changes to air quality by examining the regional environmental effects that accompanied the deregulation of the price of interstate sales of natural gas. The results provide evidence that deregulation of prices in the natural gas sector had significant effects on ==== concentration–both increases and relative decreases–independent of the contemporaneous establishment of non-attainment air quality standards and installation of ==== abatement technology at power plants. These findings also emphasize the importance of considering spatial effects of environmental policy, as evidence of average gains or lack of evidence regarding aggregate gains, may mask regional gains and losses that are vitally important to understanding the overall welfare effects.====The present findings also contributes to a second line of work investigating the potential spillover effects of policies influencing the incentives and ability to move natural gas from regions of relatively high supply into regions of relatively high demand. For example, expanded access to natural gas is associated with improvements in health for children, adults, and the elderly (Cesur et al., 2018, Cesur et al., 2017). Additional consequences of expanded natural gas availability, focusing on recent production shocks due to hydraulic fracturing, include changes to the input decisions of electric utilities (Fell and Kaffine, 2018, Holladay and LaRiviere, 2017, Knittel et al., 2015) and industrial customers (Hausman and Kellogg, 2015). More closely related to the current investigation, Davis and Kilian (2011) examine the consequences of natural gas wellhead pricing regulations and find that shortages and reallocation induced by the regulatory regime led to long lasting and large negative annual welfare costs of roughly $3.6 billion for residential customers, particularly for the north eastern U.S.–the largest volume natural gas net-importing region, prior to recent expansion of hydraulic fracturing. Other work investigating the effects of deregulation of the natural gas market has found that the deregulation of the natural gas market==== contributed to more rapid convergence of natural gas prices across regions as supplies could more easily move to higher value regional markets (Leitzinger and Collette, 2002, De Vany and Walls, 1994). Previous studies have looked at the effects of the large-scale deregulation of the natural gas sector that took place in the 1980s on consumer welfare and market allocation and efficiency due to various capital investment decisions that were locked in, partially in response to the pricing regulations. This study provides evidence of the environmental national and regional spillover consequences of incremental deregulation of natural gas wellhead prices over the 1972–1985 period, and then extends the estimated relationships to facilitate analysis of another welfare consideration by valuing the predicted health consequences. Back of the envelope calculations indicates that because of different population concentrations across importing and exporting states at the time, the net-welfare consequence may have been a substantial gain.====The paper is organized as follows.

We estimate the causal effect of air pollution on political trust in local government in China, which underpins the stability of the authoritarian state. Combining a nationally representative longitudinal survey with satellite derived PM==== concentrations, we find that a one μg/m³ exogenous increase in PM==== emissions to the annual standard of 35 μg/m³ mandated by the Chinese government, this would boost trust in local government by 21.2 per cent evaluated at the mean. We examine the underlying transmission channels and find that prolonged exposure to PM==== lowers citizens’ life satisfaction and evaluation of local government performance, induces adverse health effects, imposes additional financial burden and, albeit to a lesser extent, reduces household income.","That air pollution lowers social welfare has been well established across a broad range of disciplines. Research in economics demonstrates that exposure to air pollution can have adverse effects on infant health (Greenstone and Hanna, 2014; Knittel et al., 2016; Jones, 2020), cognitive performance (Ebenstein et al., 2016; Graff Zivin et al., 2020) and labor supply and productivity (Graff Zivin and Neidell, 2012; Hanna and Oliva, 2015; He et al., 2019; Chang et al., 2016, 2019). More recently, air pollution has been linked to higher rates of obesity (Deschenes et al., 2020), sleep deprivation (Heyes and Zhu, 2019) and aggressive behaviors (Sager 2019; Bondy et al., 2020; Herrnstadt et al., 2021), to name a few.====One area that has received surprisingly little attention is how air pollution affects citizens' trust in government. In general, political trust refers to citizens' beliefs that the government is established for improving their welfare. It underpins political support and regime legitimacy, particularly during periods of unexpected downturns (Easton, 1965). While government may be able to sidestep poorer than expected responses to natural disasters, prolonged exposure to air pollution is due, in large part, to lax or weakly enforced environmental standards. This link makes it relatively straightforward for the public to establish a connection between poor governance and air pollution, which imposes substantial economic and health burdens on citizens. To avoid air pollution, citizens may have to cancel outdoor activities and displace utility-generating consumption with costly defensive investment (Deschenes et al., 2017; Ito and Zhang, 2020). It results in huge welfare losses, which have the potential to spark public discontent. Protests about the effects of air pollution have been proliferating globally, fueled by citizens’ growing environmental awareness and ease of organizing protest via the internet and mobile phones (Pargal and Wheeler, 1996; Wang, 2013; Greenstone and Hanna, 2014).====In this study, we estimate the causal effect of air pollution on political trust in local government in China. China is ruled by an authoritarian regime and much of its political support is derived from robust economic success. Thus, in the Chinese context, when we say that political trust refers to people's beliefs that the government exists for improving their welfare, we are referring specifically to economic welfare, rather than a broader notion of welfare that includes cultural or political freedoms. The justification for employing this more narrow definition of political trust is that it is consistent with the argument many have made that the Chinese government draws its legitimacy by improving the economic welfare of its citizens (see eg. Guo, 2009). However, as noted by Ebenstein et al. (2015), the benefits of high economic growth have been increasingly offset by the cost of environmental degradation, which implies that the regime may struggle to garner support in the future.====The Chinese context provides an ideal setting for studying the relationship between air pollution and trust in local government for several reasons. First, local officials in China are evaluated by upper-level government rather than by citizens within their jurisdictions. Officials in this setting are arguably less accountable to local citizens, allowing public discontent to grow and evolve into lower political trust.==== Second, in contrast to most western democracies, political trust in China is hierarchical in that most citizens exhibit higher level of trust in central government than in local government (Chen, 2017; Dong and Kübler, 2018).==== However, virtually all policies are implemented at the local level, meaning that trust in local government is imperative to ensure the efficient functioning of the regime. Finally, air pollution has become highly politicized in China as a major concern of the central government, especially after severe smog blanketed much of China in the early 2010s. Several national-level pieces of legislation, including the landmark 2013 Action Plan on Prevention and Control of Air Pollution, were promulgated to improve air quality. However, local responses to addressing air pollution varied considerably across counties. In contrast to mass incidents related to sensitive issues, such as human rights or free elections, protests about air pollution, which are directed towards local government, are tolerated by the central government, because they help increase local compliance with environmental legislation (Wang, 2013). This context provides us with a rare opportunity to estimate the effect of air pollution on political trust in local government.====In terms of whether our findings have external validity, we argue that China's case is representative of many other authoritarian states and states with fragile democracies that, like China, garner public support, and ultimately, regime legitimacy from promoting economic growth (see eg. Nathan, 2020). However, pursuing a growth-based regime survival strategy might have unintended consequences, such as environmental degradation, which, in turn, adversely affect trust in the regime. This concern is magnified by growing environmental awareness as well as the lower costs of acquiring information about environmental degradation and the ease of organizing social assembly. For states with nascent democracies, political trust is perhaps even more critical, as it is a prerequisite for deep democratic reforms.====We use China Family Panel Studies (CFPS), a nationally representative and longitudinal survey, which tracks political trust of 33,600 adults biennially from 2012 to 2018. Since respondents may be less willing to reveal their true trust in government under an authoritarian regime, we carry out several checks to reduce the likelihood that self-censorship biasing our results. We then match the CFPS dataset with monthly PM==== concentrations according to the county of residence and month of the interview for each respondent.==== To calculate monthly PM==== concentrations, we use a satellite dataset produced by fitting aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals with a chemical transport model and proxy it to individual-level PM==== exposure.====Identifying the casual effect of air pollution on political trust has two challenges. The first is omitted variable bias. While the survey's panel structure allows us to control for individual fixed effects, there are unobserved and time-varying confounding factors that can potentially bias OLS estimates. The other challenge is that our satellite based PM==== dataset contains measurement error.====To address these two challenges, we instrument for local PM==== concentrations with atmospheric thermal inversions. Air temperature usually decreases with altitude, allowing air pollutants to rise and disperse. However, when thermal inversions occur, the temperature in the upper atmospheric layer is higher than that in the lower layer, thereby trapping air pollution at the surface. The formation of thermal inversions is a complex atmospheric phenomenon and is typically independent of factors that could influence political trust. The causal effect of air pollution on political trust is identified through exploiting the exogenous variations in PM====, which are due to thermal inversions, across different CFPS waves for the same respondent. To address seasonality in local environmental and economic conditions, we flexibly control for weather variables and include fixed effects at individual and county-year levels.====The baseline estimate suggests that a one μg/m³ increase in mean PM==== concentrations reduces political trust by 0.106 units, which is equivalent to 4.1 per cent of one standard deviation. This finding implies that air pollution has imposed a large political cost on local government, which is consistent with the growing willingness-to-pay (WTP) for clean air in China (Zhang et al., 2017; Zhang and Mu, 2018; Freeman et al., 2019; Ito and Zhang, 2020).====Our baseline result is robust to numerous checks. Excluding respondents who have intrinsically weak or strong political trust does not qualitatively change the estimates. More importantly, the documented effect is unique to trust in local government and is not evident for trust in parents, physicians, or Americans, suggesting that unobservables are unlikely to be driving our findings. Moreover, controlling for general trust, such as trust in strangers or neighbors, only marginally alters the estimates, ruling out the possibility that our finding is due to changes in general trust. Our baseline result is also robust to other checks, such as using official PM==== data from ground monitors, an alternative instrument based on thermal inversion strength as well as a set of different model specifications and clustering strategies.====Leveraging the rich information from CFPS, we examine direct and indirect mechanisms through which air pollution may influence trust in local government. We find that prolonged exposure to higher PM==== concentration raises respondents' concerns about environmental quality and, more crucially, lowers their life satisfaction and approval rating of local government performance. We find that prolonged exposure to higher PM==== concentrations significantly worsens respondents' health, measured by both self-reported health status and physician-diagnosed chronic diseases. These negative health outcomes are likely to impose additional stress on healthcare, which crowds out consumption and reduce respondents' welfare. We find that a one μg/m³ increase in mean PM==== concentrations leads to a 1.84 per cent increase in out-of-pocket medical expenditure, a standard measure that captures patients’ financial burden. Moreover, we also find suggestive evidence that higher PM==== concentrations reduces household income, which broadly underpins political support in China.====We contribute to related literature in several important ways. First and foremost, we are the first to examine the causal effect of air pollution on political trust. The only related study, of which we are aware, is Alkon and Wang (2018), who estimate the causal effect of air pollution in Beijing on local citizens’ satisfaction with government. Exploiting the exogeneous reduction in daily air pollution due to preparing for a high-stakes public event – a military parade in Beijing – those authors find that a one unit increase in the air quality index (AQI) reduces satisfaction with local government by 0.065 units. We differ from their study in that we focus on trust in local government, a concept with more profound implications for local governance. While satisfaction with government is correlated with political trust, the latter is shown to be persistent due to its historical origins, and, therefore, is arguably more difficult to manipulate (Malmendier and Nagel, 2011; Nunn and Wantchekon, 2011; Chen and Yang, 2019). Our longitudinal survey also examines trust in government for a representative sample for China as a whole, not just Beijing, and over almost a decade. The much longer time span enables us to uncover prolonged, rather than temporal, effects from exposure to air pollution. Methodologically, we exploit an external instrument, thermal inversions, a ubiquitous atmospheric phenomenon, to isolate the exogeneous variations in air pollution across China.====Second, our contribution is related to the growing literature on what determines trust in institutions. Much of the work in this area has focused on rare historical shocks and how they have shaped trust levels in modern times. For example, Nunn and Wantchekon (2011) show that differences in trust in local councils in Africa can be traced back to the Transatlantic and Indian Ocean slave trade over 400 years ago. Malmendier and Nagel (2011) find that individuals who grew up during the Great Depression exhibit lower trust in financial institutions. Chen and Yang (2019) show that the Chinese Great Famine reduced people's trust in local government. While those historical shocks provide credible sources for identification, they may be of limited value in formulating policy responses and, hence, raise concerns about generalizability (Almond et al., 2014). We extend this literature to examine the effect of air pollution, an important and ongoing political issue, on the formation of political trust.====Third, previous studies have shown that air pollution can trigger short-term emotional responses. Examples include aggressive behavior, such as violent crime (Bondy et al., 2020; Burkhardt et al., 2019; Herrnstadt et al., 2021) or dangerous driving (Sager, 2019), and making emotional decisions, related to health insurance (Chang et al., 2018), property transactions (Qin et al., 2019) and financial forecasting (Dong et al., 2019). However, the connection has not been established between air pollution and long-term outcomes. For example, existing studies have shown that air pollution triggers short-lived depressive symptoms, but has no effect on long-term oriented life satisfaction (Zhang et al., 2017). We extend the literature on the psychological effects of air pollution beyond showing it has short-term emotional impulses to demonstrate that higher levels of pollution cause lower levels of trust, which is a more persistent domain with a cognitive basis (Nunn and Wantchekon, 2011; Chen and Yang, 2019). Unlike emotional responses to the effects of air pollution, political trust takes time to be restored and losing it may generate long-lasting social costs (Chen and Yang, 2019).====Finally, we complement the small, but growing, literature on what motivates local officials in China to adopt more stringent environmental standards. Existing studies have adopted a top-down perspective, focusing on the role of local officials' promotion, as the major factor driving environmental progress (Kahn et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2018; He et al., 2020a, 2020b; Wu and Cao, 2021). However, this framework overlooks the role played by the preferences of local citizens for environmental amenities. It also neglects the fact that the central government has increasingly relied on public supervision to strengthen local environmental management (Wang, 2013). While our study does not explicitly address the association between environmental quality and political promotion, we provide novel evidence that air pollution can undermine political trust, an essential input to public governance, which, in turn, affects local officials’ performance and eventually their prospects of being promoted. Using manually collected data that tracks the political careers of local officials in China, we empirically show that lower political trust, indeed, reduces their chance of being promoted.",Air pollution and political trust in local government: Evidence from China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069622000808,26 August 2022,2022,Research Article,60.0

We employ FEMA disaster declaration data and American Community Survey data to study household post-disaster migration choices. We find that natural disasters increase households’ propensity to migrate both out of their county but within their greater metropolitan area, as well as out of their greater metropolitan area, by up to one percentage point. However, low-income households are especially less likely to move following disasters associated with less FEMA aid. We also find that disaster-affected migrants favor safer destinations. While migrating households appear to factor disaster risk reduction into relocation decisions, the results imply the need for incentivizing and aiding migration for vulnerable populations who are less likely to do so on their own.","Given growing global concern about and awareness of climate change, policy makers and scientists have become increasingly interested in the relationship between migration and environmental changes. Sea level rise and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters due to climate change are increasing the risk of residing in vulnerable areas and the economic costs of coastal concentration (Rappaport and Sachs, 2003, Kahn, 2005). Such trends may, in turn, prompt further population movements. According to the Current Population Survey, about 1% of internal migrants in the United States between 1999 and 2018 cited climate change or natural disasters as the primary reason for moving.====The literature on climate change and migration consists of three main strands: (1) climate refugees in developing countries, (2) temperature/climate amenities and location decisions, and (3) natural disasters and migration. Our paper is most related to the third, though it also builds upon methodologies from the second. Specifically, we investigate the impact of natural disasters, in particular, hurricanes, coastal storms, and floods in the US on household migration decisions.====We attempt to answer two main questions: (1) whether natural disasters drive more households to migrate or deter out-migration from locations hit by disasters in the US, and (2) whether migrant households alter their destination choices after experiencing a disaster. We utilize household, county, and migration decision data from the 2005–2017 American Community Survey (ACS) and combine them with data on federally declared hurricanes, coastal storms, and floods. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to address these questions for a large panel of recent natural disasters, rather than focusing on one specific disaster event, and to do so with household-level data.====The reasoning for focusing on the three types of natural disasters is three-fold. First, we want to ensure the comparability of treatment and control groups. Areas that are similarly prone to these three events are probably more similar in terms of geography and demographics. In contrast, areas prone to hurricanes might be quite different from those prone to other hazards such as wildfires. Second, every type of disasters may be associated with multiple disaster prevention and recovery programs (====., the Fire Management Assistance Grants of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA). It would be difficult to control for and tease apart the effects of a larger number of programs, each of which may be associated with different mechanisms. Third, western counties (which are excluded from the sample of origin counties but would need to be included were we to expand the set of disasters under analysis) tend to be much larger on average, increasing the measurement error of assigning treatment at the county level.====Because the amount of time to prepare for migration may vary across households, we consider the experience of one or more disasters in the four years prior to migration as the treatment. Since people may self-sort into various locations pre-treatment endogenously to disaster risk, we estimate the propensity of treatment of each location in a year and trim the sample to exclude origins that experience disasters very frequently and very infrequently based on the propensity score in the primary analysis.==== We further weight the trimmed sample by inverse propensity score so that the treated and control groups are balanced on their observables. Though natural disasters are clustered spatially, the specific locations being hit are random. Therefore, conditional on the probability of a disaster occurring, we may view an actual disaster as an exogenous treatment. In case the surrounding areas of a disaster-stricken location are also affected by the disaster, either physically or economically, we exclude households residing in proximity to the treated locations from the control group.====We start by modeling household migration decisions as a multinomial logit function of household characteristics and treatment. We consider three migration-related choices: stay, move locally (====, within a Designated Market Area, or DMA, ====), or move long-distance (====, to a different DMA). Individuals may keep their current job/employer when they move locally, whereas a cross-DMA move may involve a labor market change. We find natural disasters, in general, result in more households moving both locally and long-distance. Specifically, following a natural disaster, the likelihood of a household moving within- and out-of-DMA increases by 1.6 percentage points (PPs) and 0.7 PPs, respectively. These increases are primarily driven by severe disasters, for which the per capita amount of aid from FEMA is in the upper quartile.==== Indeed, households do not necessarily become more likely to out-migrate after less severe disasters (with below-median FEMA aid) but tend to do so as disasters become increasingly destructive. This tendency is more evident among higher-income households. More severe disasters may induce a stronger response because they are more salient or impactful. People may also overestimate the probability of low-frequency but high-damage events. Alternatively, more destructive disasters are associated with more aid, which could help overcome budgetary constraints, particularly for lower-income households.====Next, we focus on migrants only and estimate their probability of choosing various destinations using a conditional logit model, assuming a household selects a location that yields the highest utility of all the possible choices. The hedonic utility depends on the attributes of a location, including disaster risk, as captured by disaster history, the share of flood zone, whether it is a coastal location, and whether a disaster hit it in the prior year. We assess household destination choices separately for households moving within a DMA and for those migrating out of a DMA.====We find evidence of treated households factoring destination disaster risk into their location choices. In particular, disaster-affected households are more likely to stay away from locations struck by disasters in the year before the move than control households when relocating within-DMA. Local movers who experienced moderate or severe disasters become less likely to choose locations subject to a high risk of floods inside a DMA. A one PP larger share of Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA)==== at the destination is associated with a 0.05 to 0.2 PP decrease (representing a 5%–18% change) in the likelihood of relocating there for a treated household relative to a control one. When migrating across DMAs, treated households move further away than control households, possibly to avoid locations prone to similar natural disasters. Moreover, treated households show a stronger preference for destinations with fewer past disasters than the origin when moving locally (by 1–2 PPs, or 70%–150%) or long-distance (by 0.3–0.4 PPs, or 60%–80%). Treated cross-DMA migrants also appear to avoid destinations with more past disasters than their origin (by 0.1–0.2 PPs, around 30%). Lastly, coastal DMAs appear less favorable to treated households than control households (by 0.03–0.09 PPs, or 7%–18%) –a pattern more evident following less severe disasters. These results suggest that households may use migration as an approach to adapt to environmental risks and protect themselves from future disasters. The change in the destination choices among those who have disaster experience may result from an updated risk prior, risk preference change, or the compositional change of migrants due to their capability of moving.====In an auxiliary analysis that allows the impact of natural disasters to vary by the probability of treatment at the origin, we find that households residing in areas experiencing infrequent or frequent disasters (with a propensity score of treatment below 0.25 or above 0.75) are more likely to out-migrate than households elsewhere post-disaster. While all the treated households appear to favor safer destinations, those from areas with a medium (0.25 to 0.75) and high propensity score (above 0.75) tend to relocate to DMAs with a large SFHA share or recently struck by a disaster, perhaps to take advantage of the economic opportunities and amenities these places have to offer. This is more likely to happen after a less severe or moderate disaster. The heterogeneous risk preferences among households self-sorted into locations with different disaster risks may be an explanation, as those initially in areas with a larger chance of disasters may be less risk-averse. After all, the migration response to disasters depends on household risk attitudes, budget constraints, and disaster severity; some households may be motivated by factors other than a lower disaster risk.====Finally, we conduct several sensitivity tests for the multinomial and conditional logit estimations. We employ alternative sample criteria (alternative sets of origins, destinations, and control group), measures of disaster severity, treatment definitions (using different windows of disasters or types of disasters), and measures of disaster risks. The results are reassuring.====Consequently, we argue that while households adapt to disaster risk through migration, low-income households are more likely to stay in areas hit by less severe disasters with less aid. The preference for safer locations of disaster-affected households may imply their awareness of environmental risks. Thus, communicating environmental risk to migrants may not be as crucial of a policy priority. Rather, policy makers could focus on encouraging and enabling migration away from high-risk locations. In particular, policies that incentivize and assist the migration of the low-income population could effectively reduce the disaster risk for these people, who are presumably more vulnerable but are less likely to move away from high-risk areas.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents a review of relevant literature; Section 3 describes the data; Section 4 discusses the empirical methodology; Section 5 reports and discusses the regression results; and Section 6 concludes the paper.",The impact of hurricanes and floods on domestic migration,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009506962200081X,23 August 2022,2022,Research Article,61.0

Using a dynamic ==== analysis and developing novel, geographically delineated measures of both amenity value and geographic isolation, we find that resource discoveries cause population to grow both in the short and long-run (e.g., fifty years). However, this effect is largely driven by discoveries in unfavorable locations that might struggle to grow in the absence of a resource discovery. More generally, this paper highlights the importance of considering heterogeneous effects of resource shocks and yields insights into the observed spatial distribution of people in the United States.","What determines where people choose to live? At the sub-national level with minimal labor migration frictions, people “vote with their feet” to consume optimal bundles of private and public goods (Tiebout, 1956).==== All else equal, people prefer to live in places with low crime (Tita et al., 2006), good schools (Kane et al., 2006), and environmental amenities like warm temperature (Roback, 1982), mountain viewsheds (Groothuis et al., 2007), clean air (Chay and Greenstone, 2005, Banzhaf, 2008), and rainfall (Englin, 1996). But private consumption and real wages are also important; positive labor demand shocks attract people from near and far away. This feature of human behavior is well documented in the economics literature and is especially salient in the resource-based development literature, which affirms a robust relationship between natural-resource shocks, labor demand, and inward migration (Jacobsen and Parker, 2016, Allcott and Keniston, 2017, Feyrer et al., 2017, Richter and James, 2018, James and Smith, 2020). But this literature has overlooked the joint role of economic shocks and environmental amenity. Just as a high school degree is more important for people with low cognitive ability (Murnane et al., 2000), a boost to labor productivity might be especially important for population growth in otherwise less desirable locations.====We examine how large and localized productivity shocks—in the form of major oil and mineral discoveries—affect long-run population growth, and examine how these shocks interact with pre-existing geographic properties of the discovery site. Estimating long-run, truly posterior effects of economic shocks requires an analysis of events that happened long ago. However, doing so is often frustrated by the lack of available data; causal inference typically requires observing initial conditions. While census records provide historical subnational population estimates, county borders change over time and additional counties are added as new territories are acquired. To account for these issues, we make use of novel geospatial population count estimates measured at a 1-km==== resolution for decades between 1790 and 2010 constructed by Fang and Jawitz (2018). These data, along with our identification strategy, allow us to measure both short, medium and long-run effects (e.g., 50 years) of natural-resource discoveries.====We uniquely explore important heterogeneities in the effect of resource shocks along two dimensions: environmental-amenity value and geographic isolation. Rather than relying on existing estimates of county-level environmental amenity, which may reflect endogenous factors such as school quality (Bieri et al., 2014), or may not reflect historical preferences for environmental amenities, we use the idea that population density reflects, among other things, people’s preferences for natural amenities and construct a data-driven estimate of amenity value that is a function of purely exogenous, naturally-occurring characteristics like weather and topography. Our constructed measure of amenity value averages historical and modern preferences to reflect changes in the value of different amenities over time, and examines a much longer time span than existing indices which are surveyed in Waltert and Schläpfer (2010). We measure geographic isolation as the cost of traveling from a county to the nearest major market, defined as either an existing city, railroad, or marine highway. Instead of relying on an “as the crow flies” measure of distance, we develop a novel measure of geographic isolation that incorporates information about terrain ruggedness and water coverage between locations. In constructing these estimates, we add to the literature on economic geography by providing novel estimates of local, naturally-occurring amenity value and geographic isolation that complement the work of Blomquist et al. (1988), Allen and Arkolakis (2014), Henderson et al. (2017), among others.====The event-study analysis indicates that, fifty years after discovering oil, population density in the average treatment county is roughly 65% greater than it otherwise would have been. However, this average effect conceals important heterogeneities. When limiting our sample according to environmental and geographic favorability, we find that for relatively unfavorable counties (those with low amenity value or high transportation cost) the long-run treatment effect on population increases to roughly 170%. While the results for moderate-favorability places are similar to the overall average treatment effect, effects for high-favorability places are qualitatively small and statistically insignificant. Examining the effects of mineral discoveries reveals similar heterogeneities, although the effects tend to be short lived, partially reflecting the relatively short life of a typical mine.====We carry out several robustness checks designed to test for endogeneity bias and reverse causality, and explore the sensitivity of the results to various modeling assumptions. Our results prove to be quite robust and do not appear to be driven by endogenous natural-resource discoveries (whereby economic development leads to discovery). In particular, while discovery is potentially endogenous, the size of discovery is left to chance and we find that discoveries of large oil fields generate significantly larger effects than discoveries of small fields. We also reject the idea that our heterogeneous results are mechanical, whereby low-favorability places are less populated to begin with, and so experience larger percent increases in population following the discovery of a resource. Our analysis also addresses recent methodological scrutiny of the two-way fixed effects estimator in difference-in-differences approaches (e.g. Goodman-Bacon, 2018, Sun and Abraham, 2020), by re-estimating our main results using the interaction-weighted estimator developed by Sun and Abraham (2020).====Most directly, we contribute to a large literature that examines the economic and social effects of resource booms in the United States.==== To our knowledge, we offer the first event-study analysis of historical oil and mineral discoveries in the United States, allowing for more robust causal inference. Because many major resource deposits were discovered in the late 1800s, researchers often rely on the use of cross sections of data which are not well suited to identify pre-trends in development. Because we observe many (e.g., fifty years) of pre-discovery population data, we can better isolate and identify the causal effect of discoveries. This alone constitutes a significant contribution to the existing literature. But in addition to this, the existing literature almost exclusively estimates average treatment effects. We demonstrate that important heterogeneities exist, raising questions about the external validity of any region-specific analysis.====Existing estimates of the medium and long-run effects of American resource booms are mixed, with some finding benefits (Michaels, 2011, Allcott and Keniston, 2017) and others finding no or negative effects (James and Aadland, 2011, Jacobsen and Parker, 2016). From the perspective of a Tiebout sorting model where people “vote with their feet”, our results suggest that, on average, long-run effects of oil discoveries on the desirability of a place is strongly positive. Whether driven by marketed (e.g., labor market opportunities) or non-marketed amenities (e.g., public parks, schools, roads), people have flocked to the location of historical U.S. oil discoveries and the effect has been persistent.====This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the discovery process of historical resource discoveries in the U.S., and provides a theory of how geographic properties interact with resource shocks to bring about long-run population growth. Section 3 discusses the two main identification strategies. The various data sources are discussed in Section 4 and Section 5 describes the estimation of both amenity value and transportation cost. The results are given in Section 6.

We document that providing information to Chinese consumers on the energy costs of lightbulbs significantly increases their willingness to pay for energy-efficient bulbs, even among those who previously overestimated the savings from energy efficiency. Our results indicate that Chinese consumers are imperfectly informed, but that neither biased beliefs nor salience can explain their underinvestment in energy efficiency. Rather, we contend that consumers underinvest in energy efficiency because they are uncertain about the savings from energy efficient products.","The overwhelming share of growth in global energy demand in coming years is expected to come from non-OECD countries. Wolfram et al. (2012) argue that household consumption will account for a significant proportion of this growth, so increasing energy efficiency may lead to significant welfare benefits. However, market failures or mental gaps may lead to suboptimal consumption of energy-efficient products — a concept that has been labeled the ==== (Jaffe and Stavins, 1994, Allcott and Greenstone, 2012). The possibility of this gap motivates policies in the developed world including minimum standards, labeling, tax rebates, and other incentive programs. However, there is substantial disagreement about the existence, magnitude, and underlying causes of the gap (Handel and Schwartzstein, 2018, Allcott and Greenstone, 2012, Gerarden et al., 2017) and a dearth of evidence outside the developed world (Fowlie and Meeks, 2021) where lack of information can be a barrier to technology adoption (Mahadevan et al., 2021, Aker and Jack, 2021).====In this paper we report the results of a field experiment to test for the gap in urban China. The Chinese context is particularly important — it has experienced rapid industrialization and economic growth, and in 2014 it became the world’s largest consumer of electricity causing extreme levels of pollution.==== Against this backdrop, the Chinese government has implemented a range of energy-efficiency policies, including information programs and bans on some dirty technologies.====Our experiment consists of three key features: an incentivized multiple price list elicitation of willingness to pay for energy-efficient lightbulbs; an information intervention outlining the relative energy costs of the products; and questions that measure beliefs and prime subjects to consider environmental and monetary costs. We find evidence that there is an energy efficiency gap in China, but our results are not consistent with the hypothesis that this gap is caused by biased beliefs about long term cost savings. In the absence of our information treatment, consumers in China overestimated energy savings. However, the effect of information is positive even for those who were overly optimistic. We also find that asking subjects about these savings but not providing information does not affect their willingness to pay, which is inconsistent with the hypothesis that the energy efficiency gap is caused by lack of salience. We propose an alternative explanation for the energy efficiency gap based on uncertainty. For consumers who are risk averse, an information treatment that resolves uncertainty about the benefits of energy-efficient technologies may increase willingness to pay.====Our paper contributes to the literature identifying energy efficiency gaps in lightbulbs (Allcott and Taubinsky, 2015), vehicles (Allcott and Knittel, 2019, Allcott and Wozny, 2014, Sallee et al., 2016, Grigolon et al., 2018), home heating (Myers, 2019) and appliances (Houde, 2018). To date this literature has focused on the developed world. Exceptions are Toledo (2016) who investigate use of LED lightbulbs in Brazil and Carranza and Meeks (2021) who identify the effect of energy efficiency on electric reliability in the Kyrgyz Republic. These papers find that there is underinvestment in energy-efficient products. We contribute to this literature by testing whether a similar underinvestment exists in the important and potentially unique Chinese case and by providing a more complete picture of the mechanism behind it.====Our results point to an under-explored mechanism of information campaigns: the resolution of uncertainty regarding product attributes. Unlike previous literature, we find that subjects overestimate the savings from LED lightbulbs, but increase their willingness to pay for those bulbs when informed about actual cost savings. In contrast, Allcott and Taubinsky (2015) find evidence that information on energy efficiency operates at least partially through changes in average beliefs. While (Allcott and Knittel, 2019) find no systematic evidence of consumers underestimating vehicle efficiency they also find no evidence of an energy efficiency gap. Similarly, Allcott and Sweeney (2016) find some evidence that consumers overestimate energy savings but also do not find evidence of a significant energy efficiency gap.",Is there an energy efficiency gap in China?

By integrating household-level vehicle choice and the automobile market into a calibrated monocentric city model, we find that, for a ==== decrease of 80 percent, the long-run urban adjustment effect adds a relevant monthly welfare cost of up to 20 Dollars to the medium-run welfare cost of CAFE compliance of 128 Dollars per month (+15 percent). This welfare cost can be alleviated by about one third through the combination of CAFE with urban growth boundaries. For fuel taxes, on the other hand, the urban adjustment effect causes a welfare gain of a similar magnitude.","Reducing carbon emissions in the transportation sector is crucial in combating climate change, but, at the same time, very challenging. For the past 45 years, corporate average fuel economy (“CAFE”) standards have been a key environmental policy instrument in the United States, and for about 30 years also in the European Union, regulating automobile fuel consumption and, by extension, carbon emissions.==== Consequently, there is a robust political debate around this policy. After the Trump Administration continuously tried to repeal the stricter standards introduced during the Obama era, President Biden promises to tighten CAFE standards even more as part of an effort to move towards carbon neutrality by 2050.====We combine environmental economic approaches with urban modeling and examine a novel welfare effect as a result of fuel regulation policies, which we name the urban adjustment effect, because it is attributed to the spatial change of the city due to lower driving costs and exacerbated by the distortion in the vehicle market. Although it has been pointed out before that demand for driving tends to be more elastic in the long run caused by behavioral household responses like moving (e.g. by Linn (2016)), our study is the first one to systematically model and analyze the subsequent urban adjustment and the highly relevant welfare effect it implies. This welfare channel has not yet been considered in previous literature about welfare costs of fuel economy standards. Our research also provides a deeper understanding of how strongly the change of the urban form contributes to the consequential welfare gap if CAFE regulation is compared to the first-best policy instrument of fuel taxes.==== We add to the monocentric city model, a major workhorse in urban economics, the following two unique features: (a) To comply with an exogenous change of fuel economy standards, vehicle prices in the automobile sector adjust endogenously through improved technology and intra-firm cross-subsidies to incentivize households to buy more fuel-efficient cars so that the CAFE vehicle fleet standard can be reached. (b) In concert with these endogenous price changes, households individually choose their car based on its fuel economy. Furthermore, (a) and (b) together induce a distortion in the vehicle market, which is the starting point of a spatial dynamic, which we later call the urban adjustment effect. The cross-subsidy in the case of a CAFE policy leads to a redistribution away from the city center with the result that suburban households do pay ever less for vehicle technology. Therefore, it turns out that it is advantageous for households to move further and further out, and, while benefiting from more housing, they simultaneously make their own commuting trips longer and also increase the technology cost not only for themselves, but for all others as well, because of the fixed overall emission goal.====Our modeling advance allows us to identify the urban adjustment effect, a novel welfare channel hitherto undiscussed in the literature on environmental transportation policies. This effect exists in the long run in addition to the already known short-run cost of fuel regulation compliance. The urban adjustment effect has two counteracting components: As the CAFE policy decreases the cost of driving, households move to new residential locations further away from the city and allow for an increase in housing consumption, which translates to a welfare gain. However, at the new locations, the households choose even more fuel-efficient cars (triggering another adjustment in location choice and so on, which is a kind of multiplier effect). In equilibrium, the additional technology cost in the distorted automobile market yields a rather large welfare loss, more than counteracting the welfare gain coming from more housing consumption. The net effect of this urban adjustment is, thus, negative. It cannot be enough emphasized, that the negative welfare effect of the urban adjustment results from the combination of spatial changes of the city caused by residential location choices of the households together with the vehicle market distortion stemming from the cross-subsidy, a necessary CAFE requirement. For example, in a scenario of a 50 percent reduction in carbon emissions, which corresponds to a CAFE standard of 66 Miles per Gallon (MPG), the welfare cost per commuter due to the long-run urban adjustment effect in our reference calibration is $64 annually in addition to a medium-run CAFE compliance cost of $234 (an additional 25 percent). In the 80 percent emission reduction scenario (corresponding to a CAFE standard of 170 MPG), this welfare cost increases to $234 annually on top of a medium-run CAFE compliance cost of $1537 (an additional 15 percent).====Previous research on the welfare analysis of automobile fuel regulation is primarily based on econometric methods, limiting its findings to the short run. We, on the other hand, have built an urban simulation model, founded in the theory of utility-maximizing agents consuming housing and a composite good in a monocentric city, which uses empirically justified parameters. This approach permits us to investigate the welfare costs of long-run non-linear spatial changes in the city, the urban adjustment effect, caused by non-marginal policies. In the analysis of the model results, we disentangle the different parts of the overall welfare effect of the automobile fuel regulation policy in two steps. The first step entails the short-run welfare cost of fuel regulation compliance after allowing agents to purchase a new, fuel-optimal vehicle, but not allowing them to adjust to a new, space-optimal residential location. This is a partial equilibrium outcome constrained by immobile households. In the second step, we analyze the welfare cost of the urban adjustment after agents finally achieved general equilibrium by spatially moving their residency to a new and optimal location (and again adjusting their vehicle choice). It may seem surprising that the additional degree of freedom of the urban adjustment effect leads to a net welfare loss instead of a gain for the CAFE policy (in contrast to the fuel tax). The reason for that is the distortion due to the cross-subsidy in the automobile market as prices for cars endogenously change to achieve the CAFE standards: in their vehicle choice, households only account for a part of the technology cost increase which they cause and, thus, choose “too much” fuel efficiency, which is paid for by a cross-subsidy, which redistributes income from the central city to the suburbs. The urban spatial adjustment acts as a kind of multiplier effect and further magnifies the vehicle market distortion under the CAFE policy. On the other hand, the urban adjustment triggered by a fuel tax is indeed welfare improving as this policy approach does not require cross-subsidies and, thus, does not distort the vehicle market. Furthermore, assuming “ignorant” agents, we do not directly incorporate climate change damages into the utility function. However, we compare welfare losses due to fuel regulation with welfare gains coming from the avoided social cost of carbon.====Our study contributes to three distinct strands of the literature: we extend the research of welfare effects stemming from automobile fuel regulation, specifically from (a) fuel economy standards and (b) fuel taxes. We do that by (c) building upon the tradition of the monocentric city model,==== in particular the literature focusing on transportation energy consumption and its environmental consequences.====The literature on welfare effects of automobile fuel regulation can be separated by two foci, the first one emphasizing fuel taxes and the other one fuel economy standards. The literature on the welfare effects of fuel taxes can be further divided into studies which investigate the effect of gasoline prices on both gasoline efficiency and gasoline consumption (Burke and Nishitateno, 2013, Klier and Linn, 2013, Li et al., 2014), and research which explores the welfare effects of fuel taxes (Langer et al., 2017).====Research centering on welfare implications of fuel economy standards distinguishes between direct effects, expressed through vehicle prices, and indirect effects, caused by unpriced externalities. The direct effects originate from a link going from fuel economy standards to welfare through three pathways in the automobile market, (a) the cost of fuel regulation compliance (Austin and Dinan, 2005, Anderson and Sallee, 2011, Klier and Linn, 2012, Jacobsen, 2013),==== (b) the opportunity cost coming from the automobile industry trading off vehicle characteristics, such as engine power (i.e. measured in horsepower), against fuel consumption (Klier and Linn, 2016, West et al., 2017), and (c) the consequences on early vehicle retirements and the subsequent used car values (Jacobsen and van Benthem, 2015).====The indirect effects of fuel economy standards on welfare are an outcome of externalities (see Parry et al. (2007) for a good overview over different automobile related externalities), originated by gasoline consumption, such as carbon emissions and local pollution, and by driving, such as congestion and traffic safety. The effects of improving fuel economy on driving behavior and fuel consumption are also the core issue of the literature on the rebound effect in driving==== and the related debate about climate policy instruments in the transportation sector (cf. Greene, 1992, Small and van Dender, 2007, Frondel et al., 2008, Hughes et al., 2008, Greene, 2012, Gillingham et al., 2013, Frondel and Vance, 2013a, Chan and Gillingham, 2015 and Linn (2016)). In this context, the resulting increase in commuting trip lengths and, correspondingly, in fuel consumption in our model can also be seen as a long-run component of the rebound effect, which this literature does not account for.==== But our analysis focuses on a novel welfare effect, the urban adjustment effect, and its two components go way beyond the scope of the existing rebound literature.====Overall, none of those (mostly empirical) publications on direct and indirect welfare effects of fuel economy standards or of fuel taxes consider the welfare effects in housing consumption stemming from the interplay of fuel regulation compliance with the change of the spatial structure of the city in the long run, nor do they account for the key role of vehicle choice and the vehicle market distortion in this interplay.==== Addressing this gap in the literature allows us to identify and examine our new welfare effect, especially in the context of non-marginal fuel regulation policy.====We accomplish that by combining the welfare analysis of automobile fuel regulation with the monocentric city model, specifically following research which combines urban economics with the environmental analysis of the transportation sector (Brueckner, 2007, Kim, 2012, Borck and Brueckner, 2018). Our model, however, while building upon the previous ones, significantly varies from them, as we add an automobile sector, which endogenously reacts to and complies with the CAFE policy. Furthermore, because of our different research focus, our households’ vehicle choices are based on the fuel efficiency of the car, unlike Kim (2012), whose attention is rather on vehicle convenience. Just like our monocentric city model, none of these preceding models has a closed-form solution, and, thus, they are solved numerically.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. After presenting the model in Section 2 and policies implementation in Section 3, we analyze the environmental and welfare effects of these policies in Section 4.

This study documents energy-saving technological change to understand the trends and differences therein in ==== countries. We estimate sector-level production functions with factor-augmenting technologies using cross-country and cross-industry panel data and shift–share instruments, thereby measuring energy-saving technological change for each country and sector. Our results show how the levels and growth rates of energy-saving technology vary across countries, sectors, and time. In addition, we evaluate the extent to which factor-augmenting technologies contribute to economic growth and how this contribution differs across countries and sectors.","One of the greatest challenges facing society is the achievement of economic development and environmental conservation. Technological change has been in the past, and will be in the future, the most promising way to balance economic growth and environmental sustainability. Society has been developing and adopting new technology to make more efficient use of energy and natural resources in the face of serious environmental problems, including climate change, environmental pollution, and resource depletion. Given the global nature of environmental problems, the development and adoption of new technology need to expand worldwide. However, it has been difficult to assess how energy-saving technology has evolved across countries over time due to the lack of adequate measurements. The aim of this study is to measure and document the level and growth rate of energy-saving technology for each country and sector, thereby developing an understanding of international trends and differences in energy-saving technological change.====Measuring energy-saving technological change is challenging. Environmentally friendly technological change is typically measured in the literature using data on research and development (R&D) spending and patent counts (Popp, 2019). These measures, however, have some drawbacks. R&D spending is a measure of input into the innovation process rather than its outcomes. Patent counts are a measure of product innovation, but not of process innovation. In this study, we measure energy-saving technology in terms of output and factor inputs along the lines of the Solow (1957) residual, also known as total factor productivity (TFP). Similar to TFP, but different from R&D spending and patent counts, our measure captures the actual circumstances of national income and technology adopted in the economy, including not only patented product technology but also unpatented product and process technology. At the same time, our measure differs from TFP in that it allows technological change to be factor-augmenting.====We measure factor-augmenting technological change using sector-level production functions and firm’s optimality conditions. Our method builds upon the seminal work of Caselli and Coleman, 2002, Caselli and Coleman, 2006. The advantage of this method is that it allows us to quantify the level and growth rate of energy-saving technology for a given value of the elasticity of substitution in production without assuming the functional forms of technological change. Our analysis extends that of Caselli and Coleman, 2002, Caselli and Coleman, 2006 by using the gross-output production function at the sector level, allowing for imperfect competition, and estimating the elasticity of substitution between energy and non-energy inputs. Our study is the first to measure and compare the levels and growth rates of energy-saving technology across countries and sectors.====Although numerous studies have estimated the elasticity of substitution between energy and non-energy inputs, this study differs from those studies in that we take into account the cross-sectional and time variation in the unobserved components of factor-augmenting technologies. To do so, we use cross-country and cross-industry panel data from 12 OECD countries and construct shift–share instruments. Our results indicate that the elasticities of substitution among capital, labor, and energy inputs are significantly less than one.====We utilize our measure of energy-saving technology in two ways. First, we examine the nature of energy-saving technological change and its differences across countries. Our results show that the levels and growth rates of energy-saving technology vary substantially across countries over time for the year 1978 to 2005 both in the goods and service sectors. Cross-country differences in energy-saving technology are greater than those in capital- and labor-augmenting technologies. Moreover, in line with theoretical predictions, energy-saving technology tends to progress in countries or years in which energy resources are scarce. Second, we evaluate the quantitative contribution of energy-saving technology to sectoral gross output. Our results demonstrate that energy-saving technological change contributes to economic growth in the goods or service sector of many countries.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The next section reviews the literature. Section 3 introduces the method for measuring energy-saving technological change using sector-level production functions. Section 4 considers the identification and estimation of substitution parameters in the production functions. Section 5 describes the data used in the analysis. Section 6 presents the empirical results. Section 7 discusses the interpretation and implications of the results when the model is extended.

We find evidence that decreases in operating coal mines increased total all-cause mortality, non-drug mortality, and opioid overdose mortality, especially for counties with greater than 10 operating coal mines in 2000. Our model results for drug overdose mortality and opioid overdose mortality are sensitive to the panel's start year. For shale development, the shale boom is associated with increases in non-drug suicides but otherwise had little impact on mortality. Our findings suggest a potential role for job-training programs and the cultivation of local healthcare resources in regions suffering coal busts and suicide prevention in areas with shale development.","An extensive literature has debated the relationship between business cycles and economic conditions on mortality. Some studies, especially in the U.S., have found evidence that economic growth improves health but may increase mortality contemporaneously and that recessions decrease or plateau mortality in the short run (Ruhm, 2000, 2015, 2016; Stevens et al., 2015). Economic conditions in early life have also been associated with lower later-life mortality (van den Berg et al., 2006; Almond and Currie, 2011; Lindo, 2015; Aizer et al., 2016; Cutler et al., 2016; Hoynes et al., 2016; Noelke et al., 2019). Recent evidence suggests that some of the counter-intuitive findings are due to increased air pollution during economic boom periods and increased risky behaviors (e.g., alcohol consumption) (Cutler et al., 2016; Heutel and Ruhm, 2016). Structural changes in the economy due to trade liberalization have reduced manufacturing, and these shocks have been linked to increased mortality, particularly increased opioid mortality (Charles et al., 2018; Autor et al., 2019; Pierce and Schott, 2020). In this paper, we use plausibly exogenous shocks to local labor markets driven by the shale boom and coal bust to document a link between mortality and local economic conditions.====According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. age-adjusted fatal drug overdose rate grew from 6.1 to 21.7 per 100,000 people from 1999 to 2017; this increase was driven by the increased use of prescription and non-prescription opioids (Hedegaard et al., 2018). The causes of the epidemic are multifaceted: the increase in opioid prescriptions for pain management in the 1990s through the 2000s (Kuehn, 2007; Dart et al., 2015), the expanded promotion and marketing of pain relief drugs by pharmaceutical companies (Van Zee, 2009), and a regulatory environment increasingly focused on patient satisfaction (Kelly et al., 2016).====A growing line of research has also connected drug abuse with local demographic and socioeconomic factors, with evidence suggesting that declining economic conditions are associated with increased drug abuse (Martin Bassols and Vall Castelló 2016; Ayllón and Ferreira-Batista 2018; Carpenter et al. 2017; Hollingsworth et al., 2017; Arkes 2007; Lee et al., 2015; Charles et al. 2018; Betz and Jones 2018). The general argument in these studies is that local growth (decline) in economic opportunities may decrease (increase) substance abuse; this is commonly referred to as the “Deaths of Despair” hypothesis (Scutchfield and Keck, 2017; Stein et al., 2017; Dow et al., 2019; Ruhm, 2019).====In this paper, we examine how natural resource-fueled economic booms and busts impact local levels of non-drug mortality (i.e., all-cause mortality removing drug overdose mortality) and drug overdose mortality through the lens of prior evidence that economic conditions influence total mortality, as well as new evidence linking economic downturns to “Deaths of Despair.” We separately assess non-drug mortality as it may have a different causal relationship with local economic conditions from “Deaths of Despair”. We focus our attention on the recent shale oil and natural gas boom and the related and simultaneous bust in coal production. The shale oil and gas boom has been widespread across the U.S., leading to 52% and 39% increases in domestic oil and natural gas production, respectively, and a 79% increase in the level of electricity generation generated from natural gas between 2000 and 2016. This growth has been mainly at the expense of the coal industry; domestic coal production declined by 34% from a 21st-century high in 2008–2017 (estimates based on Mine Safety and Health Administration data). This decline has been driven by relative decreases in the price of natural gas to coal (Knittel et al., 2015; Fell and Kaffine, 2018).====We argue that these energy-related developments can shed light on how economic and social dynamics impacted non-drug mortality trends and the scale of the drug overdose epidemic. Resource development has large effects on local employment (Agerton et al., 2017), wage and non-wage income (Black et al., 2005; Brown et al., 2016; Feyrer et al., 2017), labor force participation (Hastings et al., 2017), the levels of disability and welfare-related payments (Black et al., 2002; Black et al., 2003; Charles et al., 2017), and government revenue (Newell and Raimi, 2018; Morris et al., 2019). It can also have positive economic spillovers into other industries (Marchand, 2012; Fleming and Measham, 2014). Most resource development has occurred in rural America, where opioid misuse and related mortality are the highest (Paulozzi and Xi, 2008; Young et al., 2012; Keyes et al., 2013; Monnat and Rigg, 2016; Villapiano et al., 2017).====We apply fixed effects regression models at the county level and rely on intensive measures of resource development: the number of operating coal mines and the number of spudded horizontal oil and gas wells in a county by year. Due to the opioid epidemic co-occurring with these economic changes, we start by assessing the impact on non-drug mortality. Our measure of opioid overdose mortality uses a novel correction method (Boslett et al., 2020); we correct our outcome variable because ∼22% of all drug overdoses (out of 632,331) did not have a classified drug from 1999 to 2016. Our identification strategy exploits temporal and spatial variation in coal mine closures and horizontal oil and gas well drilling from 2000 to 2016. We include state-by-year fixed effects to control for policy changes and other unobserved factors within the state and year that could impact mortality. We also estimate heterogeneity models by population characteristics and intensity of resource extraction.====For total all-cause and non-drug mortality, we find consistent evidence that declining coal mining is associated with increases in mortality. We do not observe strong evidence of a similar relationship for unconventional oil and gas development (UOGD). However, we find some evidence that UOGD reduces non-drug mortality, drug overdose mortality, and opioid overdose mortality in nearby areas. These effects appear to be predominantly felt by working-appendants for coal mining. For drug overdose mortality, we find consistent evidence that declines in coal mining are associated with increases in drug overdose mortality and opioid overdose mortality. This finding is robust across multiple specifications and subsets of the data. We find limited evidence that coal mining has spatial spillover effects on mortality outcomes. However, we find that this result is sensitive to when the panel begins: if we start the panel in 2000, we observe declining coal mining increases drug overdose mortality. If we start the panel in 2006, we observe declining coal mining reduces drug overdose mortality likely explained by differential trends occurring concurrently with the opioid overdose crisis. We find limited evidence that unconventional drilling has a statistically meaningful effect on drug overdose mortality during the shale boom. Only in long-difference models do we find evidence that unconventional drilling can reduce the studied mortality outcomes. For non-drug overdose suicides and alcohol poisoning (other “Deaths of Despair”), we find suicide rates rise with decreasing coal mining and with increasing UOGD. These general findings are not necessarily consistent with a “Deaths of Despair” hypothesis. Following our main results, we examine the potential mechanisms behind our contrasting findings and examine alternative explanations behind our results (e.g., migration, population compositional changes, differences in opioid prescribing, regional differences). We find that the population dynamics, regional differences in boom-and-bust cycles, and the exponential increase in opioid overdose mortality in areas with resource extraction lead us to conclude a causal relationship is challenging to identify for opioid overdose mortality.====We estimate our models across various subgroups by age and race/ethnicity to investigate whether the impacts affect populations uniformly. We find some evidence that declines in coal mining are most associated with increased non-drug mortality and opioid overdose mortality for those population subgroups most likely to be employed by the coal industry. However, we find evidence that declines in coal mining are associated with declining mortality for younger males, a population that is highly-represented in the mining workforce. We do not document any substantial heterogeneity by population subgroups for shale development. We also find that the most intensively mined counties primarily drive the impacts of coal mining on mortality and substantial heterogeneity comparing Appalachian States to Rocky Mountain States.====We test the robustness of our main results in several ways. We evaluate our models with alternative sets of the data; alternative specifications, and alternative modeling frameworks (i.e., long-difference models). Our findings are robust to these checks. Additionally, we compare our results to Metcalf and Wang (2019), a recent paper that estimated the positive effects of the employment share in coal mining on opioid overdose mortality rates. Our estimated relationship contrasts with that found in their paper, and we replicated their results to understand the source of the seeming contradiction. We find evidence that the difference in results is due to the length of the panel: our model results square with their model results, and vice versa, if the models are subject to the same respective study periods.====Our paper contributes to a large and growing literature on the impacts of local economic conditions on mortality and the importance of place on life expectancy (Deryugina et al., 2019; Finkelstein et al., 2019; Deryugina and Molitor, 2020). Resource extraction industries cannot exist everywhere due to geological conditions. Our results suggest that places that rely on resource extraction face large health shocks from the boom-and-bust cycles inherent in these industries. Additionally, we contribute to the extensive literature on “Deaths of Despair” by working to understand how resource-driven economic shocks impact total and drug overdose mortality. Our results suggest an economic story behind the drug overdose epidemic, contrary to recent research that suggests the main cause was an evolving drug environment (Currie and Schnell, 2018; Currie et al., 2018; Currie and Schwandt, 2020). Our paper and its findings do not contradict this recent research. Instead, they suggest that the story is more complicated and involves economic malaise. Finally, our paper contributes to a growing literature assessing the local economic impacts on mortality when migration may influence ==== mortality (Cutler et al., 2016; Arthi et al., 2019; Finkelstein et al., 2019).====Our paper also contributes to a vast literature on the local impacts of resource booms and busts on communities. Most health-related research in this space, however, focuses on the impacts of resource booms and busts on health through a pollution mechanism (Currie et al., 2017; Hill, 2018; Black et al., 2021). In this paper, we take an alternative approach and consider the health effects that stem from the economic mechanism associated with these events. Evidence of links between the coal bust and shale boom and local drug use has largely been anecdotal (Horwitt, 2014). We contribute new empirical evidence of relationships between resource development and mortality.",Mortality during resource booms and busts,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069622000614,6 July 2022,2022,Research Article,66.0

Using a large household-level dataset of energy efficiency subsidy program participation, we find that households are significantly more likely to participate when first moving into an existing home — when uncertainty about energy consumption and savings is greatest. We also find that the influence of bills and dwelling characteristics on participation declines the longer a household has lived in a dwelling. These findings suggest that there is uncertainty about the household-specific benefits of an upgrade that resolves over time. We show that when this is the case, not only are a share of participating households inframarginal (i.e. “non-additional”), many of the “additional” participants may not be economically efficient.","To reduce the fuel, capital, and environmental costs required to satisfy residential energy demand, a substantial amount of money is being poured into programs subsidizing energy efficiency.==== A common concern with these programs is that they suffer from notoriously poor additionality. That is, many of the subsidized upgrades would have occurred without financial support, suggesting that public funds are being used inefficiently (Joskow and Marron, 1992, Grosche and Vance, 2009, Nauleau, 2014, Boomhower and Davis, 2014, Globus-Harris, 2019, Risch, 2020).====Thus far, the literature studying additionality has viewed the issue as a classic principal agent problem with a single form of uncertainty. Specifically, governments subsidizing energy efficiency upgrades are uncertain about homeowners’ demand for the upgrades. In practice, however, there is another potentially important form of uncertainty — households themselves do not know how much energy will be saved, or how much comfort will be increased, when investing in upgrades. In part, this household-level uncertainty can arise due to imprecise engineering predictions of the energy efficiency gains achieved by home improvements (e.g., Fowlie et al., 2018, Christensen et al., 2021). Another source, and the focus of our analysis, is that households – and particularly those that have recently moved into a home – are uncertain about their baseline level of energy consumption because they do not know how their preferences, behaviors, and appliances will interact with the fixed dwelling characteristics. By focusing on this additional form of uncertainty in this analysis, we provide a much more nuanced understanding of additionality. In particular, we highlight that many of the “additional” participants in energy efficiency programs are encouraged to make investments with upfront costs that exceed the stream of future benefits.====Using household-level information from an energy efficiency program in a medium-sized U.S. metropolitan area, we empirically demonstrate that the pattern of program participation is consistent with household-level uncertainty about average energy usage that resolves over time following a move. To begin, we observe that the program participation rate is more than 10 times higher during the weeks immediately after a move compared to the baseline participation rate, and decays smoothly over several months. We find evidence that suggests these households performing energy efficiency upgrades soon after moving into a home rely on imperfect proxies for their home’s energy efficiency (e.g., their home’s age) to inform their decision of whether or not to participate in the program. We then illustrate how these findings imply that a potentially large share of “additional” participants to a subsidy program may also be ex post inefficient. This occurs because as households learn about their average energy use in the new home, either they would have eventually upgraded without the subsidy, or they would have learned that upgrading would not provide positive net benefits.====Our analysis contributes to the literature examining participation in energy efficiency programs (e.g., Holladay et al., 2019, Allcott and Greenstone, 2017, Palmer and Walls, 2015). While previous studies focus exclusively on the choice of whether or not to participate in an energy efficiency program, we pay particular attention to the timing of the participation decision. The timing of participation may be quite important due to the fact that households have very different information based on how long they have lived in their homes. When new owners first move into a home, they will likely have a great deal of uncertainty surrounding how much energy they will consume as well as what the resulting comfort level will be. Consequently, new homeowners will likely have the least certainty surrounding the benefits that would be achieved by making energy efficiency upgrades.====Our empirical findings cannot be explained by previous theories of investment in energy efficient durable goods which revolve around stochastic energy bills (Hassett and Metcalf, 1992, Hassett and Metcalf, 1995 e.g.,), but can be explained by household-specific uncertainty which resolves with time in a new dwelling.==== Households moving into a home do not have a precise understanding of their typical energy use, and thus energy bills, in that particular dwelling until they have been there for a while; they learn about their bills and potential gains from an energy efficiency investment over time. Noise in monthly electricity bills from month to month variation in weather or usage fluctuations may prevent learning from happening immediately. Thus, our empirical predictions follow the intuition of the classic investment under uncertainty framework of Dixit and Pindyck (2012); irreducibly stochastic energy bills coupled with initial uncertainty in the ==== bill allows households to learn about expected returns over time, but not immediately.====By considering that households may learn about their electricity usage in a new dwelling over time, we are able to provide two new insights into the impacts of subsidizing energy efficiency upgrades and audits. First, we point out that subsidies pull forward some investments that would have occurred without financial support as uncertainty resolves in the future. While previous work empirically highlights that similar subsidies can lead to demand being pulled forward in time (Mian and Sufi, 2012, Hughes and Podolefsky, 2015, Houde and Aldy, 2017), we highlight the role that uncertainty can play in driving this outcome. Second, we demonstrate that, in the presence of unresolved uncertainty, subsidies will incentivize a subset of households to invest in upgrades with costs that exceed the future stream of social benefits they will provide.====In addition to the literature on additionality, our analysis contributes to the literature examining how information affects consumers’ investments in energy-related durables.==== When purchasing an energy-consuming durable good (e.g., a vehicle, an appliance, a house), consumers face a trade-off between the upfront purchase price and the future stream of energy payments required to operate the good. Recognizing that inefficient investment decisions will occur without complete information regarding these future operating costs, policymakers have long focused on mandating the provision of information.==== Recent work demonstrates that the provision of this information (Houde, 2018, Allcott and Taubinsky, 2015, Newell and Siikamäki, 2014), as well as the precision of the information (Davis and Metcalf, 2016), can meaningfully alter consumers’ appliance purchase decisions. Similarly, our analysis suggests that meaningful welfare gains could be achieved by focusing resources towards reducing the uncertainty surrounding the benefits from improving a home’s energy efficiency. In particular, this information would be the most valuable when households are moving into a home — when the likelihood of performing inefficient energy efficiency upgrades peaks.====In the following section, we provide evidence that the likelihood of participating in energy efficiency programs peaks immediately after moving into a home — precisely when we would expect the greatest uncertainty surrounding the benefits from investing in energy efficiency. We then develop empirical predictions about the timing of audit and energy efficiency upgrade decisions. Section 3 provides empirical tests of these predictions using data from a residential energy efficiency program. In Section 4, we illustrate what our findings imply for the impact energy efficiency subsidies will have in the presence of uncertainty.

We present first causal evidence that psychological exposure to pollution – the “thought of pollution” – can influence employment performance. Over 2000 recruits on a leading micro-task platform are exposed to otherwise identical images of polluted (treated) or unpolluted (control) scenes. Randomization across the geographically-dispersed workforce ensures that treatment is orthogonal to physical pollution exposure. Treated workers are less likely to accept a subsequent offer of work (labor supply) despite being offered a piece-rate much higher than is typical for the setting. Conditional on accepting the offer, treated workers complete between 5.1% to 10.1% less work (labor productivity) depending on the nature of their assigned task. We find no effect on work quality. Suggestive evidence points to the role of induced negative sentiment. Decrements to productivity through psychological mechanisms are plausibly additional to any from physical exposure to polluted air.","Recent research points to an important negative impact of outdoor air pollution on contemporaneous labor productivity in both physically and mentally intensive work. However, the channels through which that impact works remain largely unexplored; studies typically refer to the impacts of physical exposure as candidate channels.====In this paper we report what we believe to be the first evidence of the negative effects of air pollution on both willingness to work (labor supply) and work performance (labor productivity) that can be attributed to ==== exposure. The results point to “the thought of pollution” having a potentially substantive role in explaining the reduced form results seen in recent studies, perhaps by negatively influencing mood, focus, or motivation. These effects are plausibly additional to any resulting from physical exposure (outside the scope of this study) and imply that exposure to air pollution can matter even if workers are not directly breathing it. The results also have implications for how we think about policy. Conventional approaches to ambient air pollution mitigation that rely on reducing physical exposure ( ==== management of indoor air quality, alerts aimed at encouraging people to stay indoors during poor air quality episodes) are unlikely to offer protection against effects driven by psychological exposure.====The challenge of statistically disentangling the effect of physical exposure from psychological exposure stems from the two occurring in tandem in observational settings. To ensure that the two individual-level exposures are orthogonal, we conduct a large-scale field experiment on a geographically-dispersed group of workers. We recruit prospective workers from Mechanical Turk (MT), a leading micro-task platform and the world’s largest online labor market. MT is an increasingly popular platform for experimental work in several social sciences, including economics (for examples see List and Momeni, 2021, DellaVigna and Pope, 2018, and Mas and Pallais, 2017). In exchange for a participation fee, recruits are randomized and induced to attentively view otherwise identical images of polluted (treated) or unpolluted (control) urban scenes. We refer to those who view the polluted scenes as being ‘psychologically exposed’ to air pollution. Following this, recruits are given the opportunity to complete a well-paid yet explicitly optional task of a nature and duration typical for MT. Those who accepted the opportunity were randomly assigned to either a number-based or word-based real effort task and paid piece-rate for work completed. The decision whether or not to accept this ‘employment’ and – conditional on acceptance – the quantity and quality of work completed, provide our primary outcome measures of labor supply and labor productivity. We additionally use frequency of errors in execution of the task as a measure of work quality.====The analysis here aims to complement the existing rigorous observational literature using data from a randomized intervention. Several particular advantages to the experimental design, and MT as a venue for its execution, are worth explicitly stating;====The intent and methods we apply were pre-registered with the American Economic Association’s registry for randomized controlled trials (AEARCT). Our central results are based on simple statistical comparison of mean outcomes of treated and untreated groups using OLS.====Our central results are twofold:====First, labor supply. Subjects assigned to the pollution treatment are significantly more likely to reject the offer of work. Specifically, 7.9% of the treated group reject the offer, compared to 5.4% in the control.====Second, labor productivity. Conditional on accepting the offer of work, subjects assigned to the pollution treatment complete significantly less units of work. Treated subjects assigned to a number-based task complete 10.1% less work. Treated subjects assigned to a word-based task completed 5.1% less work.==== In neither case do our estimates seem driven by outliers as we find the effect persists across a set of respondent characteristics, and broadly across the support of the outcome variables. The effect of treatment on the quality of work (as measured by frequency of errors) is a precisely estimated zero.====Last, we report a variety of additional results that probe possible mechanisms behind how psychological exposure might have its impact, robustness, and subject attentiveness.====In a supplementary analysis we find evidence that treatment induces negative sentiment. This is ==== with the causal chain from psychological exposure working via that change in sentiment. While suggestive of such a link, we cannot demonstrate unambiguously that reduced sentiment ==== the observed reduction in task performance. Similarly, we collect post-experiment responses to a battery of psychology questions designed to investigate pollution-induced cognitive anxiety. Cognitive anxiety is characterized by individuals perceiving a task as difficult, feeling inadequate at handling it, and being preoccupied with the consequences of that inadequacy. Cognitive anxiety is generally thought by psychologists to be more reliably quantified than other dimensions of the emotional state (Sarason et al., 1990). In our setting we find no evidence of a significant treatment effect on anxiety, although estimates are imprecise.====The rest of this paper is structured as follows.

We use the roll out of the ,"Despite growing standards of living worldwide, open defecation remains a widespread public health issue. Open defecation results in environmental contamination (Pickering et al., 2012, Exum et al., 2016), consequently leading to health externalities having deleterious intergenerational impacts. Lack of toilet facilities at-home, resulting in open defecation by household members, has been associated with lower health outcomes for children — lower height premiums, anaemia, and cognition among children (Geruso and Spears, 2018, Coffey et al., 2017, Hammer and Spears, 2016, Spears and Lamba, 2016). Access to gender-specific toilets in schools improves enrollment of pubescent-age girls due to privacy concerns (Adukia, 2017). Yet neither government interventions nor private markets have adequately addressed the lack of access to in-home toilets in many parts of the world. A leading example of this state and market failure was India prior to 2019, which had one of the largest rates of open defecation in the world even though the income per-capita had been growing rapidly in the preceding decade. While the proportion of people defecating in the open decreased from 70% in 2001 to 37% in 2013, these numbers continued to remain large in comparison to the world average of 12% and Sub-Saharan African countries average of 23%.====Lack of in-home toilets can have a disproportionately large detrimental effect on girls and women. Anecdotal and qualitative evidence suggests that open defecation threatens safety of women as it makes them vulnerable to violent crimes in secluded areas often at dark hours of the day.==== Women and girls are often sexually assaulted when alone. In a recent survey conducted by WASH institute and Sambodhi in 2016 across 10 states of India, women defecating in the open reported a 28 percent higher rate of sexual assault or rape. In fact, majority (58 percent) of the households surveyed in rural India reported safety concerns for women as the main reason for getting a toilet constructed within the house.==== However, to the best of our knowledge, the literature has not established causal effects of access to in-home toilets on sexual crimes against women. Our study fills this gap by doing so in the context of India.====India presents a pertinent context to scrutinize this relationship. India is considered one of the most unsafe place for women according to a recent survey.==== Access to in-home toilets has also been historically limited. Until 2014, more than one-third of Indian households reported defecating in the open. Subsequently, the government launched the ==== policy (SBM) in October 2014 to combat open-defecation. The Prime Minister of the newly elected federal government in India spearheaded the policy as one of the government’s flagship program. In this paper, we use the variation generated in the in-home toilet construction by this policy to test if access to in-home toilets affected sexual assault and rape of women in India. This policy was viewed by the government as a safety enhancing lever for women and girls, in addition to addressing health concerns emerging from open defecation in rural and peri-urban areas of the country. The main mandate of the policy was to reduce open defecation through construction of household toilets though the program also had other components to enhance cleanliness by provision of other sanitation services and a mass awareness campaign.====As per administrative data, this policy led to construction of 97.6 million toilets across India. In 2014, only 44 percent of the rural population had access to in-home toilets (individual household latrines) which increased to 66 percent in 2016. As of 2019, the official statistics put this percentage at 99 percent though some reports find a cleft between the official numbers and actual construction in the later years.==== Despite this surge in toilet construction over time, there was spatial variation in the density of toilets constructed during the initial years of the program. Table 1 documents the state-by-year variation in access to toilets for the period 2012 to 2017. Fig. 1 shows the district level access to toilets and how it changed between 2013–2016. Clearly there was an increase in access to toilets but the rate of increase was different across districts. We exploit this variation at the level of Indian districts for identification. First, we estimate a two way fixed effects specification for our count outcomes of crimes against women, analogous to a difference-in-differences strategy. We control for district and year fixed effects in order to allay concerns about confounding effects of district-specific time invariant unobservables and year-specific common macro shocks, respectively. We also conduct an event study analysis to corroborate the absence of differential pre-trends.==== We then deploy an instrumental variable strategy to bolster our identification. Our strategy exploits the fact that the largest push for toilets under the SBM occurred in areas where a greater proportion of state legislative members belonged to the party forming the national government. We use the alignment for those politicians who won close elections in legislative assembly elections in constructing our instrument. Our specifications control for the share of aligned close winners and uses as an instrument the interaction between the share of aligned close winners and timing of introduction of the SBM.====We find that an increase in household toilet facilities led to a significant reduction in sexual assaults reported by women in both reduced form and instrumental variable approaches. While reduced form estimation indicates a reduction in rapes, these results do not hold in various specifications including our instrumental variable strategy, multiple hypothesis robust inference, and other alternative specifications. In contrast, we find consistent and robust negative and statistically significant decline in assaults. Thus, our findings reveal a decline in assaults but not rape. Crimes against women typically are under-reported. In so far as this reporting tendency is time invariant and varies by regions, this is accounted for in our district fixed effects. This implies that if areas that benefit in terms of toilet construction under the SBM policy are the areas with regressive attitudes towards women and this does not change with time, our results would remain unbiased.====An issue would arise if there was a change in reporting of crimes against women over time. For example, if the mass awareness campaign/waste management component or other income shocks result in more awareness and empower women, then we would see an increase in reporting of crimes. However, we find a consistent decline in assaults. Even if there is a reporting effect of this nature resulting in greater reporting, then incidence must have declined enough such that on the net we still see a reduction.====Conversely, there could be a reduction in reporting and our results on sexual assaults could only be picking that up. This could happen, for instance, if government officials do not accurately record the assault cases in areas with more toilet construction and deflate the crimes against women. There are two reasons that cast doubt on this as a possible driver of our results. One, we do not find changes in other crimes against women which should have also decreased if this was a channel. In addition, if government interference in reporting were driving our results for sexual assaults, we would have also observed a clear decline in rape. This is because the government would have greater incentives to undermine the reporting of rape, a crime far serious in consequences. However, we do not observe a consistent decline in rape. Two, we find heterogeneous results along several dimensions which would be difficult to reconcile with a reporting change mechanism. A related alternative explanation could be that the mass awareness campaign, led to gender sensitization and a reduction in incidences of crimes against women in general. But we do not find evidence of reduction in crimes against women broadly.====There are two possible critiques of political alignment as an instrument. It is possible that BJP has a broad policy of crackdown on crimes and all crimes fall when BJP affiliates are elected to local assemblies. Another possible hypothesis is that BJP alignment helps the local elected officials to bring more resources to the districts and improve economic prosperity which leads to building of more toilets and reduction in assaults against women.==== Related to this, BJP alignment could also lead to changes in public service delivery which enhance the safety of women. However, the instrument used in the paper is an interaction of political alignment with BJP and the time period post which the SBM was implemented. Thus, we control for the effect of the political alignment on crimes in all our specifications, allaying any such concern. A series of tests and results further help us in exploring empirically the plausibility of these hypotheses and bolster our findings. We demonstrate that several other general crimes and other crimes against women like domestic violence and dowry deaths, are not affected.==== As another robustness test, we control for policing as well as gender specific policing and our results remain stable. Additionally, we also show that the instrument led to no visible gain in economic prosperity using nightlights data, which has been used as a measure of economic growth in the existing literature on political alignment effects on economic growth in India (Asher and Novosad, 2017).==== Nevertheless, we control for district-year “average luminosity” (nightlights), and a trend in development index. Our results remain unaltered.====We contribute to a body of work investigating the links between environmental shocks and violence against women.==== In developed and developing countries alike, rainfall shocks and increased temperature are implicated as reasons for increase in domestic violence and rape (Auliciems and DiBartolo, 1995, Ranson, 2014, Blakeslee and Fishman, 2014, Iyer and Topalova, 2014, Díaz and Saldarriaga, 2020). However, in developing countries, such effects can be more severe. Precipitation shocks have been shown to affect survival of girls and women (Rose, 1999, Miguel, 2005, Sekhri and Storeygard, 2014). Water stress has also received recent attention. Water scarcity can increase the distance walked by women outside their homes to fetch water and thus increase the risk of rape (Sekhri and Hossain, 2019). Our paper augments this literature by examining the effects of improved access to sanitation by way of in-home toilets on sexual violence. While extant literature has widely documented the adverse consequences of environmental conditions, our paper illuminates whether policy responses addressing deleterious environmental conditions can have mitigation effects. We show that in-home access to sanitation reduces sexual violence against women. Extant public health research documents a negative cross-sectional correlation between toilet ownership by a household and the probability of a woman in that household facing non-partner rape in India (Jadhav et al., 2016). We utilize a panel dataset and a policy reform that increased household toilet ownership to establish a causal relationship between access to in-home toilets and sexual assaults faced by women. Previous research has also documented that gender composition of children influences household’s decisions to defecate in the open. Households with girl children reduce open-defecation potentially due to concerns over harassment of girls (Saraswat, 2019). Our research complements this research by showing that access to in-home toilets does lead to a reduction in sexual abuse of women.====Our findings are of significant policy relevance. Toilet construction programs weigh the health benefits against the costs. A large literature argues that the benefits may be underestimated due to positive health externalities which may warrant subsidizing toilet construction (see discussion in Guiteras et al. (2015)). However, our results show that the benefits of toilet access even after accounting for health externalities would be underestimated if we do not account for enhanced safety of women and girls.====Aside from staggering social and financial costs, concerns over safety can also lead to under-investment in human capital by women and reduce their welfare (Borker, 2017, Chakraborty et al., 2018). We show that improving sanitation facilities in developing countries can be one channel for increasing public safety of women. Prior work indicates that policies aimed at alcohol prohibitions and regulation of drinking in bars are successful at reducing violent crimes against women (Luca et al., 2015, Khurana and Mahajan, 2021). Our paper complements this work and highlights that state policies aimed at mitigating environmental problems can also reduce violence against women in developing countries.====Rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the background for the sanitation conditions in India and the SBM policy. Section 3 describes the data we use. In Section 4, we discuss our estimation strategies.

These results reveal that CDM projects led to a positive scale effect (increased sales) after investments were made, and that these investments triggered a limited emission-reducing technique effect (decreased CO==== intensity).","It is widely expected that future growth in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions over the next century will be dominated by developing countries.==== Thus, finding effective means of curbing GHG emissions in these countries is crucial for combating climate change. One of the principal mechanisms in place today for reducing emissions in developing countries is the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), which enables firms in developing countries to sell certified emission reduction (CER) credits to buyers from developed countries, thereby reducing the effective cost of green investments for these firms.==== All else equal, lower cost of green investment should increase green-technology adoption and lower emission intensity. This corresponds to the “technique effect” described in the literature on trade/growth and the environment (Copeland and Taylor, 2003, Forslid et al., 2018, Barrows and Ollivier, 2021). However, green technology adoption may also lower marginal costs of production, thereby raising output. This “scale effect”, as it is known in the literature, would tend to increase emissions. Hence, the causal effect of the CDM on emissions levels from developing-country firms is ==== ambiguous.====In this paper, we conduct the first ==== analysis of the CDM’s contribution to emission reductions at the firm level. To do this, we link the registry of CDM projects in a single country – India – to detailed manufacturing information that allows us to track CDM-participating and CDM-non-participating firms over a long time horizon. India is an excellent case study for two reasons. First, India has hosted roughly a quarter of CDM projects world-wide, encompassing a wide variety of investments in renewable energy (mainly biomass, wind, and solar) or in energy efficiency technologies. Second, due to an unusual reporting requirement from the Indian Companies Act, firms must report their energy consumption in quantity, which allows us to compute CO==== emissions by multiplying self-reported energy usage statistics by CO==== content emission factors of different energy types and summing over energy types (Barrows and Ollivier, 2018, Forslid et al., 2018, Marin and Vona, 2021). From the CDM registry, we merge 294 firms to annual input and output data from the Prowess Indian manufacturing dataset over the period 1992–2015.====We face two main challenges in identifying the causal effect of the CDM. First, participation is voluntary, and hence, non-random. It is possible that unobserved determinants of CO==== emissions correlates with CDM participation. Second, firms enter the CDM at different times during the sample. Given technological growth, an investment made in 2000 may exploit different technological opportunities relatively to an investment made in 2013 for instance. We thus worry that the standard two-way fixed effect regression that includes leads and lags of the treatment may suffer from a contamination issue that arises from the fact that investing at different times may result in heterogeneous effects on firms’ outcomes (Borusyak and Jaravel, 2018, Callaway and Sant’Anna, 2021, de Chaisemartin and D’Haultfoeuille, 2020, Sun and Abraham, 2021, Goodman-Bacon, 2021). To address non-random selection, we adopt two strategies. First, we restrict the sample to ever-treated firms – that is, firms that ever participate in the CDM during the period 1992–2015 – and evaluate firm-level outcomes in an event study setting. In this exercise, we compare firms that have already received treatment to not-yet-treated firms. Second, we match CDM-participating firms to non-CDM-participating firms based on pre-treatment characteristics. This alternative allows us to use a larger pool of control firms, given the small number of treated firms present in our sample. In both cases, we also implement the estimation strategy from Sun and Abraham (2021), which corrects two-way fixed effect regression for contamination issues stemming from cohort-specific dynamic treatment effects. Essentially, our event-study estimates are constructed as a weighted sum of cohort-specific dynamic treatment effects, where cohorts are defined by the years of CDM registration date and where firms belonging to the last cohort serve as controls.====Our analysis indicates that CDM projects did ==== reduce the CO==== emission levels of participating firms, as emissions increased after the registration of a CDM project. However, the effect on other firm-level outcomes is not uniform across the different empirical approaches. In the sample of ever-treated firms and in the preferred econometric specification that is free of contamination and that controls for firm fixed effects and sector–period fixed effects, firms hosting CDM projects increased their CO==== emissions and energy use by 15% and 25%, respectively, in the 4-year period after registration. They also engaged in some investments, since their capital stock increased by 14% during that period, and since they produced more electricity on site, especially from renewable energy, rather than buying it from the grid. Sales increased by 16% in the 4-year period after registration, revealing a strong scale effect. By contrast, firms’ emission intensity, that is the amount of CO==== per unit of sales, and the CO==== content of energy consumption – two measures of the technique effect – were left unaffected by CDM projects. In the matched sample, using similar econometric specifications, we find that participating firms increased their CO==== emissions and energy use by 32% and 6%, respectively, in the 4-year period after registration. We also validate that capital stock, the share of self-generated electricity, and sales increased after registering a CDM project. But in this setting, we find that the CO==== content in energy consumption significantly decreased after the project is implemented, whereas the emission intensity in sales remained unaffected.====A mix of evidence obtained with a standard two-way fixed effect regression and with the estimator proposed by Sun and Abraham (2021) to accommodate for heterogeneous dynamic effects depending on the years of registration of CDM projects allows us to cautiously conclude that the scale effect that pushes CO==== emissions upward after firms made a CDM investment seems to dominate the technique effect that should have lowered the emission intensity of firms’ production and energy use. Overall, our results tend to support the pessimistic view that CDM projects did not help Indian firms mitigate their CO==== emissions.====This paper contributes to the literature on the economic and environmental evaluation of CDM projects.==== Early studies based on descriptive analyses of Project Design Documents (PDD) estimated that over 40% of registered CDM projects and 20% of CER credits generated lacked additionality (Michaelowa and Purohit, 2007, Schneider, 2007). Here, the debate over additionality was framed as follows: would firms have invested in emission abatement without the CDM program? If the answer was yes, the project was deemed not to be additional. Investments in large-scale wind and hydropower projects are at the center of this debate because other regulations (e.g., feed-in tariffs, fiscal incentives) played an important role in fostering these investments (He and Morse, 2013, Erickson et al., 2014, Sawhney and Rahul, 2014, Trotter et al., 2015). Several studies assessed the environmental impacts of CDM participation at the macro or regional levels.==== For instance, Huang and Barker (2012) found that CDM participation at the country level significantly reduced total CO==== emissions per capita (by 1.31%) and especially those from the manufacturing and energy sectors (by 3%–8%). By contrast, Zhang et al. (2018) showed that CDM projects did not improve the overall energy efficiency of sixteen countries hosting CDM projects during the 1990–2015 period. Finally, Zhang and Wang (2011) showed that sulfur dioxide (SO====) emissions did not decline in Chinese prefectures that undertook CDM projects, and assuming complementarity between CO==== and SO==== emissions due to co-generation, they inferred that CO==== emissions were unlikely to decline in the same prefectures.====To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first to evaluate ex post the effects of CDM projects using firm-level data. The closest work to ours is a study by Calel et al. (2021) investigating the additionality of wind power CDM projects in India at the project level. The authors compared the profitability of investing in wind energy production in a CDM project or without the CDM endorsement by matching projects with similar characteristics, since some wind power projects failed to receive financial support from the CDM program. Calel et al. (2021) found that at least 52% of approved carbon offsets were allocated to CDM wind power projects that would have very likely been built anyway. Compared to this study, our paper evaluates all types of CDM projects within the manufacturing sector, focuses on the company level instead of the project level, and characterizes firms’ overall environmental performance instead of the profitability of a project.====Finally, this paper is related to the literature on the effects of policy and environmental shocks on technological investments, innovation, and productivity at the firm level. In particular, Bustos (2011) showed that technological upgrading is made profitable by the increase in revenues induced by a larger market access. In the context of Indian manufacturing firms, Allcott et al. (2016) estimated that, given the loss in revenues and producer surplus of 5 to 10% suffered by the average plant due to average reported level of electricity shortages, investing in a power generator allowed firms to reduce the costs from shortages and improve their productivities. In the same way we find limited evidence of technique effect, Calel (2020) found that British firms did not respond to the European carbon market by decreasing carbon intensity of output, but rather by innovating more as shown in greater low-carbon patenting and R&D spending. In the recent U.S. context, Acemoglu et al. (2019) revealed that the shale gas boom had counteracting effects on CO==== emissions: it allowed countries to substitute away from coal, which reduced emissions, but it also increased the scale of aggregate production, which may increase emissions. This generates the same ambiguous net effect on CO==== emissions as in the case of CDM projects, but the shock is technological progress in shale gas extraction, not an offset program.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

We find that both higher levels of air pollution and longer-lasting pollution episodes significantly increase health care visits and medical expenditures. An analysis of multiple-day pollution episodes shows that marginal health care visits and marginal health costs start to increase as the pollution event lasts for consecutive days. Omitting the variation in the magnitude of the marginal effects of pollution exposure over the course of a pollution episode would lead to the underestimation of the total health costs of air pollution. Our findings provide empirical evidence that both the intensity and the duration of pollution episodes are critical considerations when designing policies to reduce the health costs of air pollution.,"Air pollution is a major environmental risk to human health across the globe. Estimates from the World Health Organization (WHO) show that ambient air pollution caused 4.2 million premature deaths worldwide in 2016.==== Air pollution affects people everywhere, but the burden is greatest in low- and middle-income countries where the air pollution levels are some of the highest in the world, the resources to address pollution are limited, and both the establishment and enforcement of related regulations are often lacking. Poor air quality imposes increased health costs related to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, shortened life expectancy, and lower productivity. However, the exact extent of the medical costs imposed by severe air pollution is still not well understood because of both the lack of large-scale, high-quality medical expenditure data and the lack of variation in air pollution levels needed to detect and analyze the dose–response relationship.====A growing literature in economics has aimed to quantify the causal impact of air pollution on health. This literature has largely focused on mortality, especially among infants and elderly individuals (Chay and Greenstone, 2003, Currie and Neidell, 2005, Currie et al., 2009, Currie and Walker, 2011, Knittel et al., 2015, Deryugina et al., 2019). These studies either exploit geographic variation in pollution levels and/or rely on variation in air quality due to traffic regulations. Some studies have used health insurance records to investigate the impacts of air pollution on human health (Deschênes et al., 2017, Williams et al., 2019, Deryugina et al., 2019). Other research has investigated the impact of air pollution on contemporaneous health by estimating the impact of pollutants on hospital visits for respiratory or cardiovascular diseases (Moretti and Neidell, 2011, Schlenker and Walker, 2016). These studies have all focused on developed countries, and they often estimate the health costs of air pollution by assuming a constant marginal effect of pollution exposure. While some studies have explored defensive expenditures related to air pollution in the context of low- and middle-income countries (Zhang and Mu, 2018, Ito and Zhang, 2019), few studies have estimated the exact morbidity costs caused by acute air pollution — likely because of the absence of ideal, high-frequency health data from areas experiencing large-magnitude variations in air quality. One exception is the work of Barwick et al. (2018), who make a first attempt to estimate the morbidity cost of air pollution in China. Using the universe of credit- and debit-card transactions in Chinese health facilities between 2013 and 2015, they find that the morbidity cost of air pollution is approximately two-thirds of the mortality cost estimates. However, their data are restricted to bank card transactions in healthcare facilities, which does not include insurance payments or other payment methods, and they do not have information on diagnoses or detailed medical expenses.====By using transaction-level data on medical expenses with detailed treatment information from the city’s largest medical insurance program, this paper estimates the short-term effects of exposure to air pollution on medical expenditures in Beijing, which suffers from notoriously high levels of air pollution. In 2013, annual fine particulate matter (PM====) concentration readings in Beijing reached 89.5 micrograms per cubic meter (====), 18 times the World Health Organization’s guideline level in 2021. In mid-January 2013, Beijing’s PM==== readings sometimes exceeded 900 ====, which is far above the “beyond index”==== level and is considered to be extremely hazardous. This striking degree of day-to-day variation in and the frequent occurrence of high levels of PM==== concentrations in Beijing provide an opportunity to examine the short-term causal effects of exposure to high levels of ambient air pollution as evidenced by health care visits, overall medical spending, and spending on respiratory drugs, cardiovascular drugs, and all other western medications.====In addition, long-lasting pollution episodes are commonplace in Beijing and other metropolitan areas in China. Although environmental scientists have recognized the need for episode-based research (Guo et al., 2014, Tan et al., 2018), empirical economic studies of air pollution have yet to address the issues that may arise not only from the intensity of pollution but also from the duration of pollution episodes. The frequent occurrence of such pollution events in Beijing allows us to investigate the variation in the magnitude of the marginal impacts of air pollution on health outcomes over the course of a pollution episode.====We access detailed, transaction-level data on medical expenses incurred between 2013 and 2016 through the Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI) program in Beijing, which covers the majority of the city’s formal residents. The detailed information on various medication expenditures provided by the UEBMI dataset allows us to explore the impact of pollution exposure on different disease-specific medication categories. Having access to the universe of transactions for all beneficiaries covered by the program also enables us to estimate the health costs of pollution for a wide range of different population groups. For each date, we examine individual transactions for all beneficiaries enrolled in the UEBMI program in Beijing at the subpopulation-group level defined by age and gender. We next combine group-by-day-level medical data with daily air pollution readings averaged from across all monitoring stations in Beijing from 2013 to 2016. To capture individuals’ short-term responses to pollution exposure, we focus on medical outcomes over a three-day period in our analysis. These combined data allow us to estimate the linear effects of air pollution on medical spending by controlling for weather conditions and for a rich set of time fixed effects. To address endogeneity concerns related to time-varying unobservables correlated with both air pollution and medical expenditures, we estimate causal effects by adopting an instrumental variables (IV) approach, with atmospheric thermal inversions as the instrument.====To examine the impact of pollution duration, we analyze and compare the effects on health care visits and medical expenditures that result from pollution events that last for a single day (====) and from those that continue over longer periods (====). After identifying all air pollution episodes in Beijing during the 2013–2016 period, we adopt a flexible approach that allows the marginal effects of PM==== concentrations on health care visits and costs to evolve over the course of an episode. With this episode-based specification, we further investigate (1) whether the health impacts of pollution episodes are heterogeneous across the population and (2) how pollution levels interact with the dynamics of health care utilization over pollution episodes.====The results of our linear effects specification reveal that a 10 ==== increase in PM==== leads to a 0.387 percent increase in three-day health care visits and a 0.376 percent increase in three-day medical expenses, suggesting a marginal increase of 1.13 percent in total annual medical expenses. This magnitude of this estimate is close to that of the relative effects found in the United States for an elderly population facing much lower PM==== concentrations than Beijing residents. As shown by Deryugina et al. (2019), inpatient admissions rates for the US elderly population rose by 0.66 percent, and inpatient spending for Medicare beneficiaries rose by 0.51 percent in response to a 10 ==== increase in PM====. Our linear effects results are also comparable to findings from China by Barwick et al. (2018), who show that an increase of 10 ==== in PM==== causes a 0.65 percent increase in the number of healthcare transactions in the short run and a 1.5 percent increase in the value of those transactions. The authors estimate a total healthcare cost that is approximately two-thirds the size of the mortality cost estimates in the literature.====The results from our episode-based analysis, which examines the varying marginal impacts of air pollution over the course of a pollution episode, reveal that larger responses emerge as the pollution event lasts for more consecutive days; this finding implies that efficiency in terms of medical costs – and benefits for human health – could be increased even further by taking steps to reduce air pollution events with a longer duration. A back-of-the-envelope calculation based on the episode-based analysis implies that the total medical cost of air pollution is equal to 3.15 billion USD per year,==== relative to no pollution, for Beijing UEBMI beneficiaries. This estimate is approximately 70 percent larger than the cost estimated by using the linear effects specification (1.83 billion USD), suggesting that the omission of variation in the magnitude of the health effects over the course of an episode leads the actual health costs of pollution to be underestimated, especially in settings with frequent occurrences of high-level and long-lasting pollution events.====Our analysis contributes to the existing economic literature on air pollution in the following ways. First, the use of detailed information on medical expenses and prescriptions enables us to estimate the impacts of air pollution on expenses in different medication categories. Second, access to detailed personal data enables us to estimate the distribution of the health impacts of air pollution across a wide spectrum of people rather than members of vulnerable groups (infants and the elderly) only, as is largely the case in the existing literature. Third, unlike other relevant studies, our analysis explores the specific features of pollution episodes in China and identifies the variation in health costs over the course of a pollution episode, which greatly matters for an accurate estimation of the total health costs of air pollution. Our episode-based study allows us to provide empirical evidence that both the intensity and duration of air pollution episodes are critical considerations when designing policies to enhance air quality and reduce health costs.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a brief description of the data on medical insurance, air quality and weather conditions. Section 3 introduces empirical models and identification strategies. Section 4 presents the estimation results for the linear effects of PM==== concentrations on health care visits and medical costs, the estimated impact of air pollution from the episode-based analysis, and the heterogeneous effects among different demographic groups as well as different pollution levels.

Using a stated-choice experiment with around 6000 German household heads, we test how exemptions for low-income households and energy-intensive companies influence the political feasibility of additional cost for the ==== of renewable energies. We find that the policy support is substantially higher when low-income households are exempt rather than the ==== aversion and fairness perceptions.","The choice of environmental policies poses challenges to policy makers as different evaluation criteria may stand in conflict and require trade-offs: These encompass economic efficiency, distributional aspects, uncertainty of abatement, as well as political feasibility (Goulder and Parry, 2008). In particular, distributional consequences of environmental policies have recently received wide-spread attention (e.g., Fischer and Pizer, 2019, Reguant, 2019, Davis and Knittel, 2019, Cronin et al., 2019, Levinson, 2019). Fischer and Pizer (2019), for example, identify trade-offs between efficiency and horizontal equity in addition to vertical equity when designing carbon policies, primarily focusing on the redistribution of carbon tax revenues. Reguant (2019) discusses tensions between distributional effects and efficiency for the cost pass-through of renewable energy policies.====Besides affecting the cost distribution across households, the specific implementation of environmental policies also affects the distribution of burdens across industries (Hagem et al., 2020). Energy-intensive companies are frequently eligible for special provisions or even exempt from costly policy measures to protect their international competitiveness (CEER, 2017, Ekins and Speck, 1999). Overall, welfare costs typically increase due to such exemptions (e.g., Böhringer and Rutherford, 1997), even though potential benefits have also been studied on theoretical grounds (e.g., Kaplow, 2019). Partly, special provisions are rather seen as resulting from lobbying by special interest groups (e.g., Anger et al., 2015, Hu et al., 2020), thus indicating an interaction with the feasibility of policy measures among specific industrial sectors. Andor et al. (2018) show that existing industry exemptions are widely opposed by the German population: their existence significantly decreases the willingness to shoulder financial burden for a more sustainable energy use.====With this paper, we contribute to a better understanding of how exemptions for specific market participants and thus the distribution of burdens actually influence the feasibility of environmental policy measures among the general population. We report findings from a single-binary choice experiment embedded in a large-scale survey among a representative sample of about 6000 German household heads. We consider both vertical equity measures, i.e., exemptions to low-income households to counter the regressivity of environmental policies (Cronin et al., 2019), as well as industry exemptions. We particularly investigate how respondents’ support for distributional policies depends on their individual economic consequences and fairness concerns. Specifically, we investigate the willingness to pay (WTP) an increase of the levy that finances the promotion of renewable energies in Germany.====In spirit of Portney’s (2004) “Obligations of a policy economist”, empirical evidence has emerged that establishes a link between the support of specific policies and process attributes, in particular distributional concerns (e.g., Johnston and Duke, 2007, Johnston et al., 1999). For instance, Almås et al. (2020) and Esarey et al. (2012) analyze the nexus between distributional policies and fairness perceptions, in particular when dealing with distributions across households. Yet, little is known about the determinants of the feasibility of specific policy measures with distributional impacts.==== Rivers and Schaufele (2015), for instance, argue that the public acceptance of a newly introduced carbon tax was increased because of its revenue-neutrality, but they do not discuss distributional aspects. Cai et al. (2010) find that the WTP for climate mitigation depends on the perception of who should mainly be responsible for mitigation and who would be mostly affected. Andor et al. (2018) suggest that negative effects of industry exemptions on the acceptability of additional burden are consistent with fairness considerations.====We first document that potential exemption schemes do not lead to a lower support for the promotion of renewable energies in general, but rather it depends on who is exempted. While we replicate the finding of Andor et al. (2018) that industry exemptions have a stark negative effect on the policy support (henceforth, PS), exempting low-income households is viewed much more favorably. In fact, abolishing existing industry exemptions and instead exempting low-income households would strongly increase the PS. If industry exemptions are deemed indispensable from a policy perspective, our results suggest that providing additional exemptions for low-income households would even increase the average PS. We further show that income and thus the eligibility for the low-income exemption rule does not affect the result. Our findings thus establish a crucial link between the distribution of burdens and the political feasibility of the policy measure.====Importantly, the political support for exemptions can be linked with behavioral measures. By running participants through an independent experiment based on Engelmann and Strobel (2004) to elicit distributional preferences, we find that inequality aversion explains the support for household exemptions but not for industry exemptions. The link between the experimental measure of inequality aversion does, however, depend on whether a participant benefits from the exemptions: for low-income households, it is consistent with them focusing on the reduction in total inequality that could be achieved through the exemptions, i.e., they prefer a less regressive policy. Conversely, for higher-income households, the measure is consistent with inequity aversion, i.e., the idea that everybody needs to bear the costs in a proportional manner. Our results further indicate that the perceived fairness of policies is crucial: first, respondents who think that exemptions for households are fair react highly positively to such household exemptions as indicated by a particularly high PS. Second, household heads who perceive industry exemptions as fair reduce their PS if industry exemptions are abolished. Moreover, we document that respondents who believe that poverty is self-inflicted reduce their PS when low-income households are excluded. Conversely, whether the respondent thinks that industry is a source of affluence has no power in explaining the support for industry exemptions.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows.

Two-part tariffs are commonly deployed with the volumetric portion often using increasing block tiers. Setting a uniform-sized first tier too small can put more burden on lower income groups that may have less efficient homes and more people per household. Setting the tier too large will allow many people outdoor use at the lowest rate. This paper analyzes the effects of the growing trend to use average winter consumption (AWC) to create individualized rate structures tailored to revealed indoor use. I use nearly eight million monthly household bills from before and after the implementation of AWC pricing to explore two questions. First, do consumers respond to the implicit discount for winter use embedded in AWC pricing and reduce indoor conservation? Second, how does AWC alter equity in terms of varying average price both across and within water use levels? On average, winter use does not increase, but the trend in reductions is slowed after AWC is introduced and a small subset of consumers do appear to respond strategically. Furthermore, AWC results in a progressive structure whether holding water use constant or allowing it to vary.","Water and energy utilities seek to balance multiple criteria when choosing a price structure (Gaur, 2007). Beyond cost recovery, they often care about conservation, equity, and affordability. Given the large fixed cost structures and need to cover those costs, most utilities deploy a two-part tariff with a fixed charge followed by a volumetric charge, as was discussed by Coase (1946). In the water space, the volumetric fees are now often set as increasing-block tiers (IBTs) where the marginal price is initially low but then increases at specified quantities. This structure is not economically efficient because consumers are paying different marginal prices and the complexity makes it less likely that consumers are responding to the correct marginal price (e.g. Wichman, 2014, Ito, 2014, Brent and Ward, 2019).====Efficiency, however, may not be the policy goal. Water is an essential resource and the IBT structure is intuitively appealing because it charges lower rates for low, essential use amounts but charges higher rates for higher, discretionary use amounts. This has the benefit of sending a signal to conserve at higher use and providing an implicit redistributive structure where higher-end users are subsidizing lower-end users. However, setting the sizes of tiers is difficult, especially given the specter that low-income households may in fact use more for essential use since they often have more people and live in less efficient, often rented houses (Borenstein, 2012). Setting the tier size too small may put undue burden on lower-socioeconomic households for essential water while setting the tier size too large will reduce the conservation signal and the potential scale of any redistribution.====A solution is to tailor the block sizes to accommodate variation in household size and characteristics (Mayer et al., 2008, Barberán and Arbués, 2009). Water utilities have adopted this approach, creating household budgets that account for the number of users (by survey), irrigable area (from satellite images), and (forecasted) weather conditions. An alternative, at least for the first “essential” tier, is to rely on Average Winter Consumption (AWC), allowing the household to reveal its actual indoor use during the non-irrigating season. Although on its own it precludes setting additional individualized tiers for outside use, it is cheaper to administer, relying only on billing data already collected.====Given the appeal of AWC pricing, it is important to consider its potential drawbacks. First, the endogenous tiers provide an implicit discount to winter water use. This rewards inefficient homes and accommodates higher use preferences, potentially leading to higher indoor use, particularly in the winter. In the extreme, consumers could “game” the system by deliberately increasing winter use for cheaper water. Second, individualized water rates also raise additional equity concerns because water users not only face distinct prices across different use levels, but those using the exact same amount of water can now pay different amounts as well.====In this paper, I provide analysis of both these potential drawbacks of AWC pricing. The empirical evidence is derived from five years of monthly-household bills – nearly eight million observations from over 130,000 residential accounts – from Denver Water. In the fourth year, Denver Water introduced AWC pricing, providing exogenous variation in the rate structure from consumers’ perspectives from which to identify the effects of the AWC structure vis-à-vis an IBT structure without the endogenous tiers.====First, I consider the effect on winter conservation and the presence of strategic behavior. A model is used to show how the endogenous nature of the tier setting creates a disincentive to conserve water in the winter because it can provide a discount for future use. Using representative pricing and water use, I provide additional context for the potential financial savings that can be achieved in Denver Water’s case. Then, using the billing data, I conduct a series of tests to detect and identify changes in winter use. On average, consumers do not increase their indoor winter use, although the overall trend of reducing indoor winter use observed is muted after AWC pricing appears.====Generally, households have not responded strategically, consistent with the notion that consumers do not find it worthwhile to understand and respond to complex utility pricing structures (e.g. Nataraj and Hanemann, 2011, Brent and Ward, 2019, Shaffer, 2020). However, there is an abnormal number of households that increase AWC sufficiently to reduce their water bills in 2016 compared to other years. Additionally, these households are more likely to subsequently adjust summer use in line with predicted substitution patterns expected from households acting strategically. Overall, the number is small, but not negligible: 1.3% or about 1700 households are estimated to behave strategically. This would imply a transfer of nearly $20,000 from the utility to these consumers under 2016 rates. This “loss” by the utility should be balanced against their other objectives of the AWC. More generally, the results suggest that a subset of consumers do pay attention to their water bills, meaning water utilities should be cognizant of the size of the incentive they present to consumers that induces such behavior.====Second, I turn to the potential regressive or progressive nature of the policy given that individuals households now pay disparate amounts both across and within water use. I initially explore the general correlations between use and demographic characteristics at the census block level. Using a regression framework, I next assess what sort of households tend to pay higher rates for the same amount of water. The findings are supportive that the AWC structure is generally progressive, leading to cheaper volumetric rates for lower income households, minority households, renters, and households with more people. However, the role of the fixed fee is important although often overlooked (Smith and Wichman, 2021). Fixed fees tend to increase as administrative costs go up, as they do with IBT and even more so with water budget-based structures. I find that in terms of affordability, the rate structure switch is regressive in that higher average rates (inclusive of the fixed charge) are paid by lower income, minority, and rental households. This result, however, is highly sensitive to particular fixed fee amount. Disentangling the causal portion of the increased fixed fee stemming from the budget implementation from other contemporaneous factors driving an increase is important for researchers and policymakers considering a rate transition if equity and affordability are goals.====This paper is the first to analyze the strategic, equity, and affordability effects of using AWC to set the size of the pricing tiers in water. The implementation of water budgets, particularly in arid regions seeking to address more frequent drought conditions, is growing but little evidence exists on how it performs in its aims to provide more affordable essential water. Baerenklau et al. (2014) find an overall conservation effect of an individual budget structure in California where the structure is popular. Kenney et al. (2008) analyzed conservation from an AWC rate structure in Aurora, CO, but they did not explicitly consider the AWC component and no analysis was done on the strategic and equity questions explored here. Brent et al. (2022) do consider equity and affordability issues surrounding administratively set (non-AWC) water budgets in California, but find the budget-based system is more regressive, counter to my findings of a progressive structure using AWC.====The findings of this paper are important to utilities by identifying the presence and extent of the downsides of an innovative rate structure to be considered amid their policy trade-offs. More generally, the paper contributes to the electricity and water literature on the effects of non-linear price structures (Shin, 1985, Grubb, 2012, Wichman, 2014, Ito, 2014, Brent and Ward, 2019) and consumers’ attentiveness to and comprehension of prices in the energy and water sectors more generally (Allcott and Wozny, 2014, Sallee, 2014, Houde, 2018, Brent and Ward, 2018, Shaffer, 2020). My suite of results confirms that few consumers pay significant attention, but that a non-negligible portion does, and AWC is progressive, even more so than IBTs, for volumetric charges but the implicit subsidy to more vulnerable households of the non-linear pricing can easily be offset by fixed fees.====The paper proceeds by first describing the IBT rates and individualized tiers generally as well as the specific structure put in place by Denver Water in Section 2. That section also describes the data utilized across the analyses. In Section 3, I focus on winter use before and after the implementation of AWC tiers to assess the changes. I turn to AWC pricing’s relationship with demographics to assess equity and affordability concerns in Section 4. Finally, I conclude in Section 5.",The effects of individualized water rates on use and equity,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069622000456,16 May 2022,2022,Research Article,74.0

We develop a finite-number-of-player, two-period non-cooperative game, where a community can impose an exogenous amount of sanctions. The model develops a nuanced view on Ostrom’s conjecture, stating that, in a common-pool resource it is easier to solve the within-period distributional issue than the between-period conservation problem. We first show that rules preventing dynamic inefficiencies may exist even though static inefficiencies still remain. Second, we show an increase in the initial value of the resource may lower the utility of all users when enforcement mechanisms are bounded. Third, we show that ==== decrease static inefficiencies but increase dynamic ones.","Traditional societies are often depicted as smart managers of their environment when modern institutions would tend to overuse or even deplete natural resources. Combined with a growing awareness of environmental issues, this vision frequently supports plans to hand over natural resource management to local communities. Nonetheless, this romantic view should be taken with caution. Although long-enduring societies that we observe today are the ones most likely to have found ways to match their living standards to the available resources, any traditional society is not ==== an efficient resource manager. For instance, Diamond (2005) argues that the full deforestation of Easter Island has lead to the collapse of a civilization.====When population density increases and natural resources become scarcer relative to the size of the population, common-pool resources (CPRs) use has to be, in some way, restricted (Hardin, 1968). There is now a large consensus over the potential ability of communities to overcome the tragedy of the commons (Ostrom, 1990). In general, successful communities somehow craft rules of resource use and preservation, implement them and sanction non-compliers. On the other hand, failure of management is often attributed to a lack of information on the state and the dynamics of the resource at stake by the communities==== in which members consider the flow of resources to be determined by some supranatural agencies where their own actions would be irrelevant to explain fluctuations in the flow. We want to focus on within community regulation, and abstract from ignorance related arguments. What makes an aware community successful is a key research and policy question in an age when information on resource flows is becoming more and more widespread, without necessarily ensuring resource preservation.====This paper builds a n-player, two-period model of a renewable and exhaustible resource extraction to analyse the following conjecture: Ostrom (1990, p. 31) says that in a CPR it is easier to solve the within-period distributional issue than the between-period conservation problem.==== Our model, therefore, incorporates both static and dynamic inefficiencies. Static inefficiencies refer to an excessive amount of effort exerted within a time period with the aim of appropriating a resource. Dynamic inefficiencies refer to an excessive amount of extraction effort in one time period, which prevents the resource from growing until the next period. Both inefficiencies lead to, at least, some dissipation of extraction rents. The model differentiates itself from most of the literature on CPRs by explicitly incorporating dynamic and static inefficiencies in a regulated CPR context.====Based on this model, we first show that increases in the growth rate of the resource lower incentives to harvest the resource in the first period and facilitate resource conservation. For a large enough growth rate, conservation of the resource becomes the payoff-dominant strategy. With a moderate growth rate, conservation is not feasible in the absence of exogenous sanctions or reputation-building mechanism. Importantly, the extraction of the resource with the optimal amount of effort also requires such mechanism, independently of the growth rate of the resource. This is true in the model but also in framed field experiments (see e.g., the trout fishing experiment described by Noussair et al. (2015)).====We then introduce the possibility of finite sanctions and show that conservation of the resource between the two periods can be achieved while the players still engage in wasteful competition in the last period, which clearly violates Ostrom’s conjecture. In particular, the violation of the conjecture happens with a relatively small number of players, a large enough growth rate, and with a moderate extraction cost. This suggests that Ostrom’s conjecture especially applies to the opposite setting, namely, large communities with slow growing resources which are relatively costly to harvest. It may explain why Huang and Smith (2014) observed closing days on shrimp fisheries, allowing shrimps to breed, but no regulation preventing congestion during the fishing season, for example, by limiting the number of fishing vessels.====Finally, the comparative statics exercise yields two insights. First, we show that, under limited sanctions, a resource with a higher initial value or a larger growth rate does not necessarily improve players’ welfare, and can even decrease their equilibrium payoffs. Finite sanctions may then be insufficient to prevent deviation from the socially optimal behaviour because the benefit of deviating becomes too large, resulting in a “tragedy of the commons,” or more precisely, a tragedy of unregulated or of not sufficiently regulated common property resources.==== It also gives a rational explanation to field insights collected in Rajasthan, India. Leaders managing community forest user groups prefer to plant mango and bamboo trees over teak. Teak has a much higher value than the former species but is not planted on community land, while often observed on private land close to owners’ dwellings. Leaders reported being unable to prevent overnight teak felling.====Second, we introduce inequalities in a two-player version of the model. We then show that inequalities decrease static inefficiency, as in [9], but they do increase dynamic inefficiencies when the resource grows over time. Indeed, the so-called small player has no other way to benefit from the resource than to exploit it in the first period, while the large player is willing to wait. This trade-off between two types of inefficiencies yields a theoretically optimal level of inequality that is a function of the value and the growth rate of the resource. Fast-growing resources are easier to manage in settings with lower inequalities, while inequalities reduce losses for slow-growing resources.====The remaining part of the paper is organized in three sections. The second section provides empirical and theoretical foundations to the model laid down in the third section.

This induced risk irrevocably reduces firms' incentives to develop and adopt new technologies, thus undermining policy effectiveness to promote technological change. We find that the quantity-based renewable energy standard is more effective than the R&D or price subsidy to maintain firms' innovation and investment incentives under the induced-risk effect. This effectiveness advantage further influences policy choices between the price-based and quantity-based policy instruments, and provides a bias in favor of a quantity instrument in Weitzman's criterion.","Technological risk is a critical concern in renewable energy firms’ investment strategies (Loock, 2012). Because future technological change is quite uncertain (for a review, see Baker et al., 2015; Anadon et al., 2016), such firms must consider the risk that how soon and what the extent the best available technology today will be replaced by innovative technologies in the future. This concern is especially important as renewable energy industry is undergoing rapid technological change. For example, a solar photovoltaic firm, which has just invested in a silicon-cell system, may soon regret its decision if a far more advanced perovskite-cell system suddenly becomes commercially available in the near future.====The main source of technological risk in renewable energy industry is ==== driven by renewable energy policies. While such policies induce technological change by bringing innovative technologies on line earlier or with higher cost efficiency (Goulder and Mathai, 2000),==== they simultaneously ==== technological risk by making firms' already-adopted technologies become obsolete more quickly. The invested solar firm, which expects to maintain a cost advantage for the next ten years, may find its adopted technology becoming completely uncompetitive only in five years due to induced technological change. Such induced technological risk considerably decreases firms' incentives to invest (e.g., Grenadier and Weiss, 1997; Farzin et al., 1998; Doraszelski, 2004), and the declining investment incentives may further influence firms’ incentives to develop new technologies (Rosenberg, 1976). In particular, Popp (2010) provides evidence for this induced-risk effect by showing that adoption of existing pollution control technology is slower when future technological change occurs more quickly under nitrogen oxide regulations. As induced technological risk may slow down the innovation and diffusion processes in renewable energy industry, a challenge for policymakers is to promote technological change by completely understanding this risk effect.====This article investigates the effect of induced technological risk on firms' incentives to develop and adopt renewable energy technologies. Furthermore, we explore how this ==== will influence current renewable energy policy choices, especially choices between a quantity-based and a price-based policy instrument. We particularly emphasize two relationships: (1) how induced technological risk will change firms' incentives to adopt new technologies; and (2) how this change, in turn, affects firms’ incentives to develop new technologies. The combination of the two relationships allows us to completely describe the interaction between technology diffusion and innovation process through the induced risk. In this way, we highlight the linkage between the two processes, which helps policymakers understand this induced-risk effect more completely.====Our study connects with three strands of literature. First, it is related to the literature on firms' incentives to promote technological change under different policy instruments (e.g., Milliman and Prince, 1989; Jung et al., 1996; Fischer et al., 2003; Fischer and Newell, 2008). These studies focus on the policy effect of induced technological change, and investigate that how it could affect regulated firms’ incentives to innovate and invest by improving the return of environmental investment. A major consensus is that a price-based policy instrument is more recommendable than a quantity-based instrument, because the former gives regulated firms more flexibilities to find the optimal investment strategies.====Second, our study is related to the growing literature on optimal environmental policy design under technological uncertainty (for a review, see Baker and Shittu, 2008; Böhringer et al., 2009). This literature mainly concentrates on the social risk caused by uncertain R&D outcome and the resulting policy choice. In particular, Requate (2005b) investigates the interaction between environmental policies, incentives to adopt new technologies, and the innovation activities. He concludes that a tax system with appropriate design outperforms all other policy instruments. Clancy and Moschini (2018) explore the R&D incentives induced by a mandate and find that an optimal carbon tax is more efficient than an optimal mandate.====Third, our study is related to the prices vs. quantities literature initially proposed by Weitzman (1974). Research in this area typically compares a price instrument with a quantity instrument under an exogenous uncertainty. Related to our context, Zhao (2003) and Krysiak (2008) investigate the effects of cost risk on firms' investment level and technology choice under different environmental policies. Close to our research, some studies also analyze the relationship between technological risk, firms' options to invest, and environmental policy choices. van Soest (2005) explores the impacts of taxes and quotas on firms' investment timing when energy-efficient technologies arrive stochastically over time. von Döllen and Requate (2008) analyze social optimal policies for polluting firms’ investment patterns if some better technologies are expected in the future but with uncertain arrival timing.====Despite these advances on (induced) technological change and policy choices, existing literature cannot adequately address the issue of induced technological risk in renewable energy policies. The first strand of literature on firms' incentives to promote technological change does not consider induced technological risk, because technological change is typically modeled in a deterministic fashion in these studies. In the second strand of literature about technological uncertainty, it is typically assumed that environmental technology will be improved only once, so induced technological risk and the associated option to adopt newer technologies in the future is implicitly neglected in firms' investment decisions (e.g., Laffont and Tirole, 1996; Baudry, 2000; Requate, 2005b; Baker and Adu-Bonnah, 2008; Clancy and Moschini, 2018). However, as Popp et al. (2013) show empirically, rather than any single breakthrough, the success of renewable energy technologies relies on the accumulation of a sequence of new technologies. Thus, even if the current technology is already profitable, a firm may still have incentive to wait for future better technologies. This behavior is observed in practice. By surveying 93 renewable energy investors, Masini and Menichetti (2012, 2013) show that investors will significantly reduce their current profitable investments when they have a positive attitude toward future radical technological innovations. Finally, although technological (cost) risk and the option to invest are considered in several research regarding prices vs. quantities (e.g., Zhao, 2003; van Soest, 2005; von Döllen and Requate, 2008), induced technological risk, brought by environmental policies, is not explicitly modeled in such frameworks. This is because these models treat the technological (cost) risk exogenously without analyzing firms’ R&D activities, so that this risk remains the same before and after a policy implementation.====This article attempts to fill the research gap by highlighting the role played by technological risk and by examining how it will change under renewable energy policies. To do so, we develop a dynamic investment model composed of an upstream R&D sector and a downstream investment sector. In the R&D sector, following Aghion and Howitt (1992), Segerstrom (1998), and Akcigity (2010), we assume that many technology firms are engaged in an R&D race to develop a sequence of new technologies, which cumulatively lower the production cost of renewable energy. The R&D outcome is uncertain, so the arrival timing of each new technology is characterized by a random draw from the R&D distribution. A technology firm can choose the R&D distribution it would like to contribute, which represents its R&D efforts to pursue the new technology. In the investment sector, energy firms observe all R&D information about new technologies, and then form a common rational expectation about the process of technological change (described by a Poisson stochastic process). By comparing the risk and return arising from the future technological change, energy firms decide their investment strategies, and choose whether to invest when each new technology has arrived.====We then introduce three widely used renewable energy support policies, an R&D subsidy for technology firms, a price subsidy for energy firms, and a quantity standard that establishes a minimum production quota of renewable energy, into the model. In our two-sector setting, these policies not only affect energy firms' investment behavior, but also influence technology firms’ R&D efforts. As R&D efforts are major forces behind technological risk, the latter channel allows us to investigate the mechanism of how renewable energy policies induce technological risk.====We have two main findings. First, induced technological risk not only reduces energy firms' incentive to adopt new technologies, but also decreases technology firms' R&D efforts to develop new technologies. This is because the slow diffusion process caused by the induced risk in turn reduces firms' incentives to innovate. Moreover, we show that this induced-risk effect is irrevocable because it cannot be compensated by varying the design of the selected policy (e.g., raising the subsidy or standard level). Second, under this irrevocable risk effect, we show that the quantity standard is more effective than the two subsidy approaches to maintain firms' innovation and investment incentives. The intuition behind this result is that the enforcement effect under the quantity instrument (some firms are forced to invest regardless of the induced technological risk) partly offsets the induced-risk effect, whereas there is no such an enforcement effect under a price instrument. We further show that this effectiveness advantage for quantity standard further influences the problem of prices vs. quantities, and provides a bias in favor of a quantity-based instrument in Weitzman's criterion.====Our model and results contribute to the literature in three important ways. First, we extend the literature on firms' incentives to promote technological change by emphasizing that in addition to the policy effect of induced technological change, there is also a policy-induced risk effect that matters in firms' incentives to innovate and invest. This extension complements policymakers' knowledge about firms' gain and loss from the induced technological change, which helps them evaluate firms' incentives to promote technological change more comprehensively. Second, whereas the policy analysis literature on technological uncertainty emphasizes the policy effect on social technological risk (e.g., no satisfied technologies developed in the future for the society), we add a new policy effect on private technological risk. Our results suggest that ignoring this private effect may lead to many technologies policies failing to achieve their targets. Third, compared with the prices vs. quantities literature that typically assumes an exogenous cost uncertainty, our two-sector setting endogenizes technological uncertainty, an important type of cost uncertainty driven by technological change. This extension allows us to analyze how cost uncertainty may potentially change in response to renewable energy policies. We show that the changing technological uncertainty creates a new induced-risk effect, and consequently, affects the policy choice in Weitzman's framework.====The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the basic structure of our model. Section 3 Renewable energy policies and induced technological risk, 4 Effects of induced technological risk under renewable energy policies introduce renewable energy support policies into the model, and investigate the resulting induced-risk effect. Section 5 compares the performances of the three policies under the induced-risk effect, and discusses policy implications.

CB has primarily been used to elicit preferences in recreation demand models or to assess market demand. Although CB shares the hypothetical nature of other SP methods, there has been limited assessment of CB validity and incentive compatibility. Focusing on hypothetical bias and framing effects, we design an incentive-compatible decision mechanism that examines the validity of CB ====. We find hypothetical bias associated with an overstatement of quantities in CB responses, but the overstatement does not appear to arise from strategic behavior. We also find that overstating quantities is not significantly affected by framing, but framing does affect the convergence of CB and revealed preference responses. These findings raise questions about the validity CB research and its demand revealing properties but provide some avenues to address these concerns.","The methods and conditions under which stated preference (SP) research produces valid preference and value estimates have received considerable attention in the economic literature. Issues, such as, hypothetical bias, the willingness-to-pay (WTP) and willingness-to-accept (WTA) disparity, and sensitivity to scope have challenged economists to gain additional insights into contingent valuation and other stated preference methods (Carson, 2012; Haab et al., 2013; Hausman, 2012; Kling et al., 2012). Nevertheless, SP methods are widely applied to elicit economic values and preferences when revealed preference or market data and prices are not available. The importance of SP research to real-world applications has motivated researchers to assess the validity of the methods and develop best practice recommendations for stated preference practitioners to provide as accurate as possible value estimates (Bishop and Boyle, 2017; Johnston et al., 2017).====Three common SP methods that elicit values and preferences from survey responses are contingent valuation (CV), discrete choice experiments (CE), and contingent behavior (CB). The CV method relies on respondents making a single binary choice (for or against) on a proposed change at a given cost (Johnston et al., 2017). The CE method has respondents choose among two or more alternatives with multiple attributes and costs (Johnston et al., 2017).==== Finally, with the CB method, respondents indicate intended behavior in quantities (e.g. number of park visits) given a proposed change.==== CB scenarios could be presented in ways similar to CV scenarios or CE scenarios. Regardless of scenario presentation, CB always asks for intended behavior in quantities or frequencies (Englin and Cameron, 1996), rather than a binary vote in CV or a choice from two or more options in CE. As a result, the focus of CV/CE and CB are different: CV and CE focus on valuation (e.g. how much one would be willing to pay) while CB method focuses on behavior (e.g. how many trips one would take). Given the different focuses, CB has different applications than CV/CE methods. CV and CE are widely used to elicit use and non-use values and remain the only available economic approaches to elicit non-use values of goods such as ecosystem services when revealed preference (RP) data (i.e. preferences revealed by actual observations or choices) are not available (Johnston et al., 2017). In recreation demand models, CB data are mostly used in combination with RP data to construct economic values of recreation resources (e.g. Grijalva et al., 2002; Nobel et al., 2020; Bertram et al., 2020; Lloyd-Smith et al. 2019a), by adding more variation in attributes or travel costs and addressing potential omitted variable bias for model estimation (Englin and Cameron, 1996; Yi and Herriges, 2017). In food demand or marketing studies, CB is used to assess market demand for new attributes or products that consumers purchase in multiples (e.g. milk in Kuperis et al., 1999; beverages in Yang et al., 2020). Notwithstanding these differences, CB shares its hypothetical nature with CV and CE, and therefore also shares the potential issues concerning its validity.====Validity assessments to examine the unbiasedness of SP estimates are different among SP methods depending on the focus and methods. Researchers have paid more attention to assessing validity of CV and CE methods due to their unique role in eliciting non-use values for welfare analyses. Efforts have been made to evaluate criterion validity, construct validity, and convergent validity of CV and CE in game-theoretical models of incentive compatibility (e.g. Carson and Groves 2007; Vossler et al., 2012; Carson et al., 2014), empirical evidence with survey and experimental approaches (e.g. Ryan and Watson 2009; Heberlein et al., 2005; Doyon and Bergeron 2016; List 2001), and meta analysis (Penn and Hu, 2018). Yet, only a few studies evaluate construct validity and convergent validity of CB methods with stated preference surveys (e.g. Whitehead et al., 2010; Atkinson and Whitehead 2015; Grijalva et al., 2002; Whitehead et al., 2014; Jeon and Herriges 2010) and no studies, to the best of our knowledge, have assessed criterion and convergent validity of CB methods using economic experiments.====The objective of this study is to assess the validity of stated preference contingent behavior methods experimentally. We design an economic experiment with an incentive-compatible decision mechanism to elicit intended behavior in quantities as a basis for criterion validity assessment in a between-subject design. To detect hypothetical bias, we relax the condition of incentive compatibility – a necessary condition for criterion validity assessments – in a treatment with subjunctive and nondirectional framing that is adapted from SP surveys. We also test whether strategic overstating can be induced by directional framing to increase provision probability (Lloyd-Smith and Adamowicz, 2018; Lusk et al., 2007). To assess convergent validity, we use a within-subject design to examine whether hypothetical CB and subsequent incentive-compatible RP responses of the same individuals converge.====We find the existence of hypothetical bias in CB responses as individuals tend to overstate their intended behavior. But strategic behavior does not appear to be the cause of the overstatement as directional framing (provision framing) does not substantially affect the magnitude of hypothetical bias. However, framing affects the convergence of CB and subsequent RP responses – they converge in the directional framing treatment but do not converge in the nondirectional framing case. We also find that non-convergence is mainly driven by participants who did not have prior experience with the good/attribute used in the decisions. These findings on criterion and convergent validity highlight the importance of incentive compatibility and framing and they have implications for researchers for improving CB validity in survey design, sampling, and data analysis.====By using experimental methods to assess the validity of CB responses, this paper makes contributions to the experimental economics and stated preference literatures. Specifically, these contributions fall into three categories. First, we formally design an incentive-compatible decision mechanism that elicits individual preferences by asking quantity decisions – much of the experimental literature, and particularly auctions, focuses on value elicitation. Second, this study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to test criterion validity of contingent behavior responses by using an incentive-compatible design with real money payments. Third, we provide experimental evidence on convergent validity of CB responses in a controlled environment in contrast to previous studies that have tested convergent validity with stated preference surveys. Altogether, by examining criterion and convergent validity in the same experimental setting, we draw attention to the selection of appropriate tests/approaches to assess the validity of SP methods.====This paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we present a survey of relevant literature that motivates the experimental design. Section 3 provides a detailed description on experimental design and procedure. Section 4 presents main results of the experiments.

Despite its critical impacts on management, little is known about the effects of such uncertainty on the formation of regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs). In this paper, we design a dynamic stock recruitment framework to examine this issue in a common pool setting. We find that stock growth uncertainty critically affects equilibrium behaviors under both open loop membership and dynamic membership. For instance, we delineate conditions under which uncertainty induces full non-cooperation in equilibrium. Strategic behaviors may also shift equilibrium outcomes from full non-cooperation under deterministic conditions to full cooperation under uncertainty when countries anticipate a small environmental variability. Moreover, strategic interactions to extract the resource stock may lead to higher individual payoffs under uncertainty. We also outline the differences in equilibrium responses of membership, harvest, and payoff to mean preserving spreads under both open loop membership and dynamic membership.","The persistence of overfished stocks is a permanent concern for policy makers. The fraction of the world’s overexploited marine fish stocks has increased continuously from 10% in 1974 to 33.1% in 2015 with dramatic ecological and economic consequences (FAO, 2018). A major international fisheries policy undertaken to address this issue is the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). A key feature of this management approach is that by allowing coastal states to exercise authority over the area extending up to 200 nautical miles into the sea (i.e., Exclusive Economic Zones), it reduces the open access to internationally shared marine resources (UN, 1982).====One important issue that the UNCLOS failed to address is the management of fish stocks that migrate across coastal EEZs (i.e., straddling fish stocks) and highly migratory fish stocks. This issue resulted in persistent overexploitation over decades of such fish stocks. Further effort to supplement the UNCLOS led to a new international agreement known as the UN Fish Stocks Agreement, ratified in 1995 (UN, 1995). A core principle of this new agreement is that the management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks must be undertaken cooperatively through regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs). RFMOs usually set total allowable catches (TACs) for member countries.==== These TACs are critical for the conservation of some species. Yet, these conservation prospects are affected by the strategic behavior of outsiders, countries that are not RFMO members. The decision to sign in an RFMO or not is a free-will decision. Importantly, the presence of uncertainty influences the strategic behavior of all countries (RFMO members and non-members).====Despite evidence that random environmental shocks (e.g., changes in temperature, nutrient) lower our ability to predict fish stock dynamics,==== the effects of associated uncertainty have been largely ignored in the economic literature on the formation of RFMOs. Given current problems with environmental variability and overfishing, a number of research questions are critical for policies aimed at contributing to a sustainable use of renewable resources. How does stock growth uncertainty affect stable RFMOs? What are implications on harvest strategies? Can stock growth uncertainty raise the net present value of utility? In this paper, we address these and related questions.====Our analysis builds on two strands of economic research that examines resource extraction under uncertainty. The first strand concentrates on a renewable resource harvester’s extraction responses to several types of uncertainty. For instance, Mirman, 1971, Reed, 1979, Singh et al., 2006, Costello and Polasky, 2008, and Springborn and Sanchirico (2013) focus on the stock growth uncertainty case whereas (Costello and Kaffine, 2008) address scenarios in which future ownership is uncertain. Clark and Kirkwood (1986) and Sethi et al. (2005) investigate scenarios in which the harvester faces managerial uncertainty (e.g., measurement errors) and environmental uncertainty (e.g., stock growth uncertainty). In a common pool context where several harvesters operate non-cooperatively in all periods, the second strand investigates the effects of stock growth uncertainty (Pindyck, 1984, Antoniadou et al., 2013) or uncertainty about a possible spatial shift in the resource distribution (Costello et al., 2019).====Our analysis has important ramifications within the economic literature on renewable resource management under the threat of regime shift. Interesting contributions include (Polasky et al., 2011, Fesselmeyer and Santugini, 2013, Sakamoto, 2014, Miller and Nkuiya, 2016), and Diekert (2017). These papers focus on scenarios in which the initial state of the ecosystem may permanently and randomly shift to another state characterized by a lower resource growth function. Following Reed (1979), we concentrate on ecosystems (e.g., high sea) in which the resource growth function can randomly shift between a continuum of states due to changes in environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, salinity, nutrients). In this setting, our analysis suggests that strategic interactions to extract the resource stock yield novel equilibria.====Our analysis suggests that the decision to join or leave a RFMO (or a coalition) is driven by two opposing mechanisms. On the one hand, each coalition member would like to defect as individual coalition members gain less relative to counterpart non-coalition members. This mechanism is called the “free riding effect” and reduces incentives to join the coalition. On the other hand, leaving the coalition lowers the next period’s expected resource stock, which reduces each player’s expected payoff. This mechanism is called the “conservation effect” and raises incentives to join the coalition.====To determine the relative strength of the two mechanisms, we first examine the effects of stock growth uncertainty on the stability of RFMOs under open-loop membership. In this setting, countries decide whether or not to join a RFMO in the initial period and such membership decisions remain unchanged in all subsequent periods. When the elasticity of inter-temporal substitution is greater than one, countries are likely to choose sufficiently heterogeneous harvest levels over time. In this context, when the biological return of the resource is high and the number of countries is small, we find that the conservation effect dominates the free-riding effect for large coalitions such that full cooperation occurs in equilibrium. Full non-cooperation happens in equilibrium when countries anticipate a sufficiently high variability in biological growth. In this context, uncertainty lowers the level of cooperation relative to the deterministic scenario. Small mean preserving spreads may shift the equilibrium from full non-cooperation to full cooperation. In response to an increase in uncertainty, the interplay between the free riding effect and conservation effect may lower individual harvests even if the elasticity of inter-temporal substitution is high.====We also examine how stock growth uncertainty affects the stability of RFMOs under the dynamic membership scenario. In this case, each player is allowed to reconsider his membership and harvest strategy every period. Our analysis suggests that any variation of the resource stock generates a change of the same magnitude on the free riding effect and conservation effect. As a result, equilibrium coalitions do not depend on the resource stock. When the elasticity of inter-temporal substitution is greater than one, our analysis identifies several equilibrium outcomes. We delineate economic, environmental, and biological conditions under which any increase in the resource stock by one unit leads to a higher individual payoff under full cooperation relative to scenarios of unilateral defection. In such contexts, the coalition constituted of all countries forms in equilibrium. By substantially reducing the expected return from conserving the resource stock, a high level of uncertainty dramatically diminishes economic benefits from joining the coalition, which leads to full non-cooperation in equilibrium. In this setting, uncertainty reduces equilibrium coalitions relative to the deterministic environmental condition case. In response to small mean preserving spreads, strategic interactions may lower the net present value of utility.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

The first intervention consists in the technological renovation of 70 branch buildings through the installation of an automated energy management system. The second is an energy-saving competition that involved more than 500 branches for a year. Using two separate difference-in-differences estimations, we find that the technological renovation curbs electricity consumption by 15.8 percent overall, and by more than 25 percent outside the main work schedule. The behavioral intervention reduces electricity consumption, by around 6 percent outside the main work schedule, and by 2.4 percent overall, although not significantly so. The estimated cost-effectiveness ranges between 3.4 and 8.8 € cents per kWh saved for the technological intervention, and 9.8 and 17.8 € cents per kWh saved for the behavioral intervention. Our findings suggest that for both interventions, energy savings in the workplace are more easily obtained by reducing passive energy waste than through behavioral change during working hours.","In the last years residential energy use has reduced in Europe whereas commercial consumption has increased (ODYSSEE-MURE, 2018). Commercial buildings are therefore a critical lever to achieving global sustainability goals (Güneralp et al., 2017). Human behavior is one of the primary sources of energy waste in buildings (Y. Zhang et al., 2018), especially in the workplace, where market failures lead to the inefficient use of appliances. The most relevant market failures are principal-agent problems –namely, the misplaced incentive between those who consume energy (the employees) and those who pay for it (the company)– and imperfect information –i.e., the lack of knowledge about one's energy consumption and the related operating costs.====There are different strategies to reduce energy consumption in the workplace. Based on traditional economic theory, employees act as rational and selfish agents who, in the presence of market failures, do not make any effort to save energy. They save energy if the company incentivizes them to do so, for instance by introducing bonuses and gifts. Alternatively, the company can take it upon itself to control its employees’ energy consumption, such as by installing smart appliances or automating peak load management. In this case, little effort is required from employees to reduce their consumption, and their compliance with the installed technology will generate energy savings for the company.====Other possibilities are offered by the growing body of research in behavioral economics. Behavioral economics shows that people systematically deviate from traditional economic predictions and that such deviations can be harnessed to promote resource conservation (Thaler and Sunstein, 2008). For example, individuals tend to reduce their energy consumption if they discover that they consume more than others do (Allcott, 2011) or that their actions have negative environmental and health consequences (Asensio and Delmas, 2015). Through this type of intervention, a company can foster its employees’ active engagement in energy-saving practices while leaving the incentive structure or the physical environment unchanged.====This study investigates the impact of two large-scale interventions implemented by an Italian bank to save energy. The first is a technological renovation that consists in the installation of a building energy management system (BEMS). This system optimizes branches' energy consumption. Seventy highly consuming branches receive the renovation (==== group) between 2016 and 2017; thereafter, the system is operational. The second is a behavioral intervention, consisting in an energy-saving competition among the bank's branches. Every month, the three branches that save the most are announced through the company's newsletter. Winners gain social recognition along with small material rewards in the form of eco-gadgets. The competition is reinforced by additional incentives, such as individual challenges, and complemented by informational materials. The program involves more than 500 branches that did not previously receive the renovation (==== group) and takes place throughout 2019.====We assess the impact of the two interventions on branches’ monthly electricity consumption using difference-in-differences (DID) specifications over the years 2015–2019. We estimate the effect on total electricity consumption as well as consumption by time of use (TOU), so that we can differentiate the impact of the interventions during and outside working hours. We exploit the different timing of the interventions and assignment rules to estimate two separate DID: the former goes from the beginning of 2015 to the end of 2017 and estimates the impact of the renovation using as comparison the branches in the behavioral group and the yet-to-be-renovated branches of the renovation group. The latter covers the period from mid-2017 to the end of 2019 to assess the impact of the behavioral intervention using as a comparison the branches in the renovation group.====We find that BEMS curbs total electricity consumption by 15.8 percent, which is consistent with engineering studies (Lee and Cheng, 2016). The savings are non-significant during the main work schedule but are substantial outside it (more than 25 percent). The behavioral intervention reduces total electricity consumption by 2.4 percent. However, this effect is not statistically significant, which may be caused by limited statistical power. Outside the main work schedule, the behavioral intervention significantly lowers electricity usage by around 6 percent. Orland et al. (2014) find similar evidence in the context of a serious game intervention to save energy at work. The lack of significant effect for both interventions during the main work schedule is consistent with two explanations. First, there may be little inefficiency in electricity usage during the day, which limits the potential for energy savings regardless of the nature of the intervention. Second, the cost to workers of curbing energy consumption may be higher within than outside working hours. While at work, employees need to use appliances for work-related activities and may not be willing to sacrifice their comfort or exert effort to conserve energy. On the other hand, keeping appliances and lights switched off overnight only requires employees to make an effort when leaving the office. Although the technological renovation reduces employee control over energy consumption, the latter explanation is also valid to explain the null effect of BEMS during the main work schedule. Indeed, while BEMS primarily optimizes consumption outside the main work schedule, consumption during the day results from both efficient energy management and employees’ behaviors.====We use branches' characteristics to explore possible sources of heterogeneity in programs' effects and inform similar future efforts. Contrary to our expectations, none of the characteristics investigated –baseline electricity consumption, heating type and size– influence the impact of the behavioral program. This result is striking because it is inconsistent with the heterogeneous effects of behavioral interventions by baseline consumption in the residential sector (e.g. Allcott, 2011; Andor et al., 2020, 2022; Bonan et al., 2021), and because it suggests that peer effects are not relevant in our setting, contrary to the relevant role they are believed to have (Staddon et al., 2016). The technological intervention instead is more effective in branches with higher passive waste (i.e., energy waste caused by inefficient building parametrization), consistent with its larger effectiveness in reducing consumption outside working hours. We also perform additional analyses. Using data on branches' ranking and employees' engagement with the behavioral program online material, we find that the energy-saving competition is the program's component that drew the most attention among employees.====Our study contributes to the literature on energy conservation. Research on energy conservation in the workplace is relatively scarce (Stern et al., 2016), in spite of the large share of energy consumption coming from the commercial sector and of the peculiarities of this setting that may influence interventions' effectiveness. In particular, employees may not be motivated to save energy, since they do not have financial incentives to do it. The absence of bills also reduces the salience of energy consumption, which is usually relegated to the background relative to work-related tasks. The fact that the workplace's energy consumption is the product of many people's actions may further hamper employees' motivation to change behavior, as they may perceive that their personal efforts to save energy have little effect on the company's total consumption (Carrico and Riemer, 2011). Finally, even if employees want to save energy, they can do so only by changing their behavior, whereas in the residential sector homeowners can also invest in energy efficiency improvements (Brandon et al., 2017).====We add to the limited literature investigating the effectiveness of technological renovations in commercial buildings (e.g. Liang et al., 2018; Qiu, 2014) and show the impact of a behavioral intervention in the workplace. While psychological and engineering studies provide early insights into the effect of this type of intervention on employees' energy use (Staddon et al., 2016), economists to date have paid more attention to the residential sector (Andor and Fels, 2018; Ramos et al., 2015).==== A few notable exceptions exist, though. Brown et al. (2013) show that changing the default settings on office thermostats significantly reduces internal temperature. Handgraaf et al. (2013) and Ornaghi et al. (2018) find that social influence effectively prompts behavioral change when it is tailored to an employee and addresses a specific source of inefficiency, such as office windows left open overnights. This type of feedback is generally the most effective because it highlights the link between one's action and a given outcome (Tiefenbeck et al., 2018). Finally, Charlier et al. (2021) find that only combinations of nudges prompt employees' conservation efforts. We extend this literature by investigating whether an intervention targeted at the group level reduces total buildings' consumption.====Finally, we provide an estimate for the cost-effectiveness of the two interventions. We find that the cost-effectiveness of the behavioral intervention (between 9.8 and 17.8 € cents/kWh) is at most at the lower end of estimates of interventions à la Opower in the residential sector (e.g. Allcott, 2011; Andor et al., 2020). For the technological renovation, the estimated cost-effectiveness ranges between 3.4 and 8.8 € cents per kWh saved. While these calculations point to greater cost-effectiveness for the technological than for the behavioral intervention, directly comparing the two figures may be misleading. In particular, the lack of random assignment to receive either BEMS or the energy-saving competition implies that pre-existing differences between the two groups may affect the impact estimates for the two programs. Moreover, the two interventions were implemented over different time periods.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we provide a detailed description of the two interventions. Section 3 discusses the data and empirical strategy. Section 4 presents the results, while Section 5 concludes.",Evaluating the impact of technological renovation and competition on energy consumption in the workplace,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069622000390,14 April 2022,2022,Research Article,79.0

In an economy with monopolistically competitive heterogeneous firms, the equilibrium can be sufficiently characterized by an aggregate statistic, which we call the “coverage scope”. Given the coverage scope, emissions leakage to the unregulated firms results in a “U-shaped” relationship between the aggregate emissions and emissions price. As the coverage scope expands, the second-best emissions price increases. Firm heterogeneity and market power, the two defining features of the monopolistically competitive economy, affect emissions pricing differently. While both of them affect the second-best emissions price indirectly through coverage scope, market power has an additional direct effect. As a result, the optimal emissions price does not always decrease in market power, which contrasts the traditional wisdom on emissions pricing under complete regulations. A multi-sector model is numerically simulated using parameters for five Chinese manufacturing sectors to be incorporated into a proposed national ==== pricing program. Quantitatively, the second-best price varies substantially with coverage scope and market conditions.","Political pressures and the costly procedures of monitoring, reporting, and verifying (MRV) emissions often prevent environmental policies from covering all polluting firms (Becker et al., 2013, Bellassen et al., 2015, De Cara et al., 2018).==== In practice, government may use various rules to select a subset of firms with different characteristics in its jurisdiction into an incomplete regulation.==== Unfortunately, detailed information on the regulated and unregulated firms may not always be available to policy makers, especially in many developing countries. In the absence of this information, policy makers still have to set the regulated emissions price (i.e., emissions price facing the regulated firms) in order to achieve the aggregate emissions abatement goal or to maximize social welfare.====In this paper, we mainly examine incomplete regulations in a single-sector economy with heterogenous firms engaging in monopolistic competition in the short run. We find an aggregate statistic, which we call the “coverage scope”, that is easily observable but nonetheless sufficient to characterize the equilibrium. This property holds under any rule that the government may adopt to select firms into the regulation program. To implement the incomplete regulation, policy makers have to decide on the coverage scope and emissions price. Correspondingly, we study how the aggregate emissions vary with emissions prices while holding the coverage scope constant, and explore how the second-best emissions price varies with coverage scope and interacts with important characteristics of the monopolistically competitive economy with heterogeneous firms.====In the model, labor is supplied inelastically by a continuum of homogeneous agents.==== Firms differ in productivity, produce differentiated goods using labor, and abate emissions ====
 ==== Copeland and Taylor (1994). Firms regulated by the emissions pricing program face a higher emissions price than other firms. We define coverage scope as the regulated firms’ ==== across all firms in the sector when the regulation ====. Different firm selection rules bring the same equilibrium outcomes as long as their coverage scopes are the same. Intuitively, regulated and unregulated firms in the model can be aggregated into two representative firms. The relative aggregate productivity of the two representative firms is captured by the coverage scope and does not change in emissions price.====The practical significance of this finding can be best illustrated with an example. Consider that the central government is constrained to impose an emissions price on firms in one region of the country. However, accurate firm-level information within the jurisdiction is unavailable. Nonetheless, the central government can still use available regional aggregate statistics such as aggregate employment or output data==== to figure out at what level the regulated emissions price should be set to achieve its emissions abatement goal or to maximize social welfare. It can also decide which region to regulate based on between-region comparisons. The information requirement for the government to make a decision is greatly reduced.====Many incomplete environmental regulations cover the same set of firms for at least a few years. For example, the energy conservation program during the 11th Five-Year Plan of China only regulated energy usage of the same set of one thousand large firms in a five-year window, but the regulation stringency increased year by year (Chen et al., 2021). The Chinese carbon cap-and-trade market have also regulated only the same set of large emitters for the first two years since its implementation. Under such situation, the coverage scope of the regulation stays constant as long as market conditions stay relatively stable during a short time window. Given the coverage scope, there is a “U-shaped” relationship between the aggregate emissions and the regulated emissions price. We call this phenomenon the “emissions rebound” and the price which minimizes aggregate emissions the “pivot price”. Increasing the regulated emissions price drives the regulated firms to abate more, but also induces labor reallocation and emissions leakage to the unregulated firms.==== The facts that the unregulated firm is relatively dirtier and labor reallocation is more elastic at higher regulated emissions price together result in the rebound.====For a given coverage scope, the second-best emissions price is obtained by equating the marginal benefit (MB, i.e., the marginal increase in environmental quality) and the marginal cost (MC, i.e., the marginal reduction in consumptive utility) of raising the regulated emissions price. When the coverage expands, possibly due to the inclusion of more firms or regions into the regulation program, the MB and MC both increase because a larger share of the economy now faces the higher price, which seems to obscure the effect of coverage scope on second-best emissions price. Nonetheless, while the reduction in leakage weakens the misallocation cost and ==== the increase in the MC, it ==== the increase in the MB, or, alternatively, accelerates the decline in aggregate emissions from raising emissions price. Consequently, when the coverage scope expands, the MB increases by a larger extent than the increase in MC; therefore, it is more socially desirable to impose a higher emissions price.====When market conditions evolve, the coverage scope changes because the pre-regulation market share of the same set of regulated firms is different under different market conditions. An important market condition in the monopolistic competitive market is market power. Holding coverage scope constant, the second-best emissions price is ==== increasing in the market power of firms in the economy. This is in sharp contrast with the traditional wisdom that market power decreases optimal emissions price in complete regulations (Barnett, 1980, Requate, 2006, Holland, 2012). Intuitively, increasing market power implies lower elasticity of substitution between product varieties, which reduces emissions leakage and the misallocation cost component of the marginal abatment cost (MAC).====When the firm selection rule does not change, market power also affects the second-best price ====through its impact on the coverage scope. The effect depends on the specific firm selection rule. For example, in size-based policies where only large firms above a certain emissions or output threshold are being regulated,==== the coverage scope is decreasing in the degree of market power. When market power increases, the differentiated products are less substitutable, so that large regulated firms employ less labor resources, and the coverage scope decreases. The direct and indirect effects are opposite, making the effect of increasing market power on the second-best emissions price non-monotonic. In contrast, the effect of firm heterogeneity, another important market feature, on the second-best price transmits only indirectly through its impact on the coverage scope. The lesson here is that as market conditions evolve, the coverage scope is effectively changing even if the set of firms under regulation remains unchanged. Therefore, policy makers should adjust the emissions price correspondingly.====Quantitatively, we calibrate our model to match five Chinese manufacturing sectors that are planned to be incorporated into a national-wide CO==== emissions pricing program, and simulate how the coverage scope in each sector affects the maximum sectoral CO==== emissions abatement and the second-best sectoral CO==== emissions price. Our quantitative analysis is illustrative, but it highlights the quantitative significance of our theoretical predictions. The maximum emissions abatement achievable and the second-best emissions price vary substantially with coverage scope in each sector. For certain sectors, the non-monotonic effect of market power on the second-best emissions price is very pronounced. The results also highlight the importance of updating emissions prices timely when coverage scopes expand; if the coverage scopes of the five sectors increase from their current levels to full coverages but the CO==== prices remain at the second-best levels for the currently planned coverage scopes, the welfare gain from regulating CO==== emissions will drop by 3.8%.====Our paper contributes to the literature in several ways. First, despite the fact that firms are heterogeneous in the real economy,a large literature that analyzes incomplete emissions regulations (Holland, 2012, Baylis et al., 2013, Karp, 2013, Baylis et al., 2014, Holladay et al., 2018, Fowlie and Reguant, 2022) assume that the economy is populated with two exogenously given representative firms with different regulation status. On one hand, we provide a clear micro-foundation about how the two representative firms can be aggregated from the mass of heterogeneous firms in the spirit of Melitz (2003). On the other hand, the representative firms should be ==== rather than ====. Market conditions such as market power and firm heterogeneity can influence the representative firms’ productivities through their impacts on the coverage scope. It is necessary to take these effects into consideration when we use a representative firm framework to conduct policy evaluations. Relatedly, our study also contributes to the literature that emphasizes firm heterogeneity in environmental policy design. For example, a few papers discuss the long-run effect of firm heterogeneity through firm entry and exit (Konishi and Tarui, 2015, Li and Sun, 2015, Anouliès, 2017, Andersen, 2018), and Tombe and Winter (2015) show that emissions intensity standards create firm-specific distortions and reduces aggregate productivity in the short-run when firms are heterogeneous. Our study shows another scenario where firm heterogeneity matters in the short run. That is, it affects social welfare through affecting the coverage scopes of incomplete regulations.====Second, this study fits naturally into the literature that analyzes the sources and mitigations of emissions leakage under incomplete regulations (Bernard et al., 2007, Fowlie, 2009, Fischer and Fox, 2012, Baylis et al., 2013, Karp, 2013, Baylis et al., 2014, Cui, 2017, Holladay et al., 2018, Fowlie and Reguant, 2022). The main focus of this literature is how features of production technologies and policy arrangements affect leakage and aggregate emissions when the coverage scope and the regulated emissions price are ====. Our study complements this literature by asking how the change in total emissions from further raising emissions price depends on the ==== and the ====. The “U-shaped” aggregate emissions curve has practical policy implications. When the current regulated emissions price is already high, further increasing the emissions price might simultaneously increase the aggregate emissions and decrease the aggregate output. A couple of studies (Böhringer et al., 2012, Lanzi et al., 2012, Böhringer et al., 2014a) in the international leakage literature look into how the degree of carbon leakage depends on the size of the “abatement coalition”. Our definition of coverage scope is more general than their definition of coalition size. Specifically, they can only compare the difference in leakage between two coalitions if the set of members in one coalition is a subset of the members in the other. We do not require such a relationship when making comparisons based on our definition of coverage scope.====Third, by analyzing how emissions leakage interacts with coverage scope and determines the second-best emissions price, we contribute directly to the literature on optimal environmental policy design under tax interactions. The tax interaction effect, in general, implies that emissions price should be lower than the marginal emissions damage when emissions price exacerbates pre-existing distortions (Goulder, 1995, Goulder et al., 1997). A couple of papers have studied emissions pricing under leakage (Bernard et al., 2007, Holland, 2012, Böhringer et al., 2014b), but they do not analyze what are exactly the pre-existing distortions and how leakage interacts with them. Meanwhile, they treat coverage scope as given and do not characterize how the second-best emissions price varies with coverage scope. We explicitly show that the distortions of increasing emissions price under incomplete regulations is reflected in the misallocation caused by differentiated emissions price and emissions leakage. The degree of misallocation is affected by the coverage scope and market power.====In this sense, we also extend the literature on the tax interaction between emissions price and market power. The literature has extensively studied the effect of market power under complete regulations (Barnett, 1980, Requate, 2006, Holland, 2012), but remains silent on how it affects optimal emissions price under incomplete regulations. In particular, Holland (2009) compares the effectiveness of emissions tax and intensity standard under ==== incomplete regulations ==== market power. Fowlie (2009) studies incomplete regulation under oligopoly, but mainly focuses on emissions leakage itself in the analytical analysis. Neither studies look into the effect of market power on second-best emissions price under incomplete regulations. We fill in this gap by showing that market power affects both leakage and the coverage scope, and consequently, the second-best price. Although our main model does not incorporate other design features that may mitigate leakage, such as border adjustment and explicit/implicit output tax/subsidy (Fischer and Fox, 2012, Holland, 2012, Konishi and Tarui, 2015, Böhringer et al., 2017, Fischer et al., 2017, Fowlie and Reguant, 2022), the main insights of our analysis still hold qualitatively, as long as leakage is not completely eliminated by these additional features.====Finally, our paper is also related to a recent literature on optimal coverage selection. Kaplow (2017) investigates optimal coverage in size-based regulations when firms reduce output strategically to avoid regulation. De Cara et al. (2018) study optimal emissions price and optimal coverage simultaneously when there are MRV costs associated with regulating more emissions sources. However, both studies ==== the effect of leakage. Without leakage, the optimal emissions price always equals the marginal social damage of the pollutant, regardless of the extent of program coverage (De Cara et al., 2018). We extend this literature by showing that part of the benefits from increasing coverage scope attributes to the reduction in misallocation caused by leakage.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 introduces the model setup and shows the properties of coverage scope. Section 3 qualitatively evaluates the “U-shaped” emissions curve, the second-best emissions price, as well as the roles of coverage scope and market conditions. We also provide extensions and additional discussions on model. Section 4 provides a quantitative illustration of the previous findings, using the Chinese national carbon emissions trading market as an example. Section 5 concludes the paper.","Emission pricing, emission rebound, and the coverage scope of incomplete regulations",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069622000389,12 April 2022,2022,Research Article,80.0

The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that global renewable generation needs to double by 2030 to meet the energy-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (IEA, 2020).==== Intermittent energy sources that come on and off depending on the prevailing weather conditions, such as wind or solar energy, account for more than 70% of this growth.==== Renewable intermittency imposes risks on the power system, which must constantly balance the instantaneous supply and demand. Electricity interconnection, or cross-border transmission, is recognized as one of the solutions to mitigate the effect of intermittency (Bahar and Sauvage, 2013).====Electricity interconnection allows for the international exchange of electricity.==== This trade opportunity has several established benefits. First, international trade harnesses varying comparative advantages in electricity production across countries, similar to other tradable goods, which can lower prices to consumers through improved production efficiency. Second, trade can facilitate the penetration of renewables to regions with insufficient renewable resources or technology, thereby enhancing the potential to lower carbon dioxide (CO====) emissions. Third, unique to electricity trading, trade acts as an insurance against local renewable supply shocks in the case of renewable production uncertainty.==== In other words, interconnection can utilize the imperfect correlation of renewable production across geographic locations.====However, interconnection does not ensure lower carbon emissions. As electricity is a homogeneous good, electricity transmission does not differentiate between the source of production. Therefore, increased interconnection gives regions and countries expanded access to cheap thermal power and potentially exacerbates carbon emissions. Moreover, since trade increases production efficiency and lowers the price for consumers, the increased demand for electricity may also increase thermal power production. With several countries pushing for more interconnection and setting goals to reach carbon-neutrality by mid-century, it is essential to understand how interconnection affects the adoption of technologies, capacity investments, and subsequent carbon emissions.====To examine the effect of electricity interconnection, I construct a stylized two-country model of electricity production with renewable intermittency and trade. Each country can be either ==== (that has both fully controllable thermal and intermittent renewable technology) or ==== (that has only thermal technology). The electricity producers invest in domestic generation capacity given the available technologies and produce electricity depending on the invested capacity, interconnection capacity, and the state of nature. I characterize the optimal consumption levels, installed capacities, state-dependent output levels, and trade quantities. The optimum is equivalent to the competitive equilibrium with Pigouvian carbon pricing, i.e., a carbon price equals to the social cost of carbon (SCC). This simplified electricity network captures the main characteristics of electricity production and trade, which allows me to identify the trade-offs in renewable capacity investment and carbon emissions brought by increased interconnection.====The theoretical analysis shows that the effect of interconnection depends on the characteristics of the two trading markets. First, consider interconnection between one Clean and one Dirty country, where the Dirty country has an absolute advantage over thermal production. In this case, expanding interconnection has ambiguous effects on carbon emissions, depending on the level of the Pigouvian carbon price. If the carbon price is low, interconnection exacerbates carbon emissions because of lowered renewable investment and increased electricity consumption. The intuition lies in the fact that transmission is a two-way street. It facilitates the diffusion of renewables when the wind is blowing and cheaper thermal production when generation backup is needed. With a low carbon price, interconnection gives the Clean country access to a lower-cost thermal technology, which would decrease its adoption of renewables (composition effect). In addition, the optimal consumption in the Clean country increases with interconnection because of the cheaper backup thermal energy (scale effect). Both the scale and composition effect push emissions upward. However, with a high carbon price, interconnection expands the market of Clean country renewables, which are now less costly than thermal energy (composition effect). The composition and scale effect take opposite directions, and depending on which effect dominates, emissions can increase or decrease.====Second, suppose both countries are Clean and have imperfectly correlated renewable energy. In that case, renewable curtailment may be optimal in some states, i.e., having idle renewable capacity or disposing of renewable-generated electricity. Interconnection kicks in as insurance against intermittency when the wind in one country dies and is still blowing in the other country. The country where the wind still blows must have a renewable capacity exceeding local demand to export electricity. This excess supply becomes idle when the wind is blowing in both countries. The renewable curtailment rate and the corresponding level of carbon emissions depend positively on the correlation of occurrence of their windy states. The more positively correlated, the more likely some capacity stays idle and the higher the carbon emissions, all else being equal. Therefore, not allowing for curtailment reduces the capacity that can be installed, undermining any insurance motive of interconnection, and trade will not take place in any state of nature.====To quantify the scale of the effect in the theoretical analysis, I calibrate the stylized model with four European countries and simulate the outcome of the EU2030 interconnection target. The four countries represent four distinctive energy profiles: Germany has various types of coal and renewables; Poland is predominantly powered by coal; France has over 70% nuclear with gas and wind power; and Spain has a mix of nuclear, thermal, and renewables. Therefore, I use Germany–Poland (DE–PL) and France–Spain (FR–ES) interconnections to represent the Clean–Dirty and Clean–Clean cases, respectively. For the FR–ES interconnection, I also simulate FR wind–ES wind and FR wind–ES solar separately to explore the effect of intermittency correlation. The simulation result shows that the EU2030 level of interconnection increases annual emission by 1.69%, 8.39%, and 5.19% in the DE–PL, FR wind–ES wind, and FR wind–ES solar case, respectively, compared to the status quo, under a carbon price of €100 per ton of CO====.====This paper contributes to several strands of literature. The most related is the growing theoretical literature on electricity production with intermittent renewables. Ambec and Crampes (2012) construct a model which characterizes the optimal energy mix between the controllable source and the intermittent source and analyze the market structure to decentralize the optimal mix. The literature also analyzes issues including how different policy instruments, demand-side response, and storage technology affect the optimal energy mix with renewable intermittency (Ambec and Crampes 2012; 2019, Helm and Mier 2019). However, the literature has ignored electricity transportation and distribution issues in energy transition, i.e., congestion and grid design. This paper builds on the model of Ambec and Crampes (Ambec and Crampes, 2012, Ambec and Crampes, 2019) to consider how electricity interconnection affects the optimal energy mix and, consequently, its effect on carbon emissions.====This paper also contributes to the theoretical literature on electricity transmission. Joskow and Tirole (2000; 2005) consider an electricity transmission model and study how the allocation of transmission rights affects market power and investment incentives on transmission lines. In the absence of intermittency, the trade flow always goes in one direction in equilibrium. However, with renewables, whether a country buys or sells electricity depends on the state of nature. Thus, the value of the network is also state and energy-source dependent. Intermittency changes the investment incentives of transmission lines compared to the uni-directional trade setting. Other theoretical models that study the gains from electricity trade consider stochastic demand (Antweiler, 2016), seasonal supply variations (Von Der Fehr and Sandsbråten, 1997).==== These studies assume exogenous generation capacities and examine how trade affects production, whereas I endogenize all capacities, which allows me to investigate how trade impacts the level of capacity investment. Fell et al. (2021) examine the environmental benefit of a marginal increase of investment in renewables depending on whether the power line is congested or not. They take the marginal approach, i.e., look at how a marginal increase of renewable impact welfare, and consider only the case of Clean–Dirty interconnection. In contrast, I focus on the optimal energy mix and also explore the benefit of imperfectly correlated renewables on the network. This paper supplements the growing empirical literature on estimating the gains from electricity trade and the social value of renewables (LaRiviere and Lyu, 2022, Abrell and Rausch, 2016, Gowrisankaran et al., 2016, Cullen, 2013, Fell et al., 2021) by identifying the key determinants of the social value of trade with intermittent renewables.====Moreover, this paper contributes to the extensive literature on the effect of trade on the environment. Openness to the international goods market can impact a country’s environment directly and indirectly. Antweiler et al. (2001) is the first to provide a theoretical framework that decomposes the impact of trade on the environment into a scale, technique, and composition effect. Depending on the environmental aspect (e.g., pollution, biodiversity) and countries, empirical estimates of the overall effect can be either positive or negative (Copeland and Taylor, 2004, World Trade Organization and United Nations Envrionmental Protection, 2009, Antweiler et al., 2001, Managi et al., 2009, Curtis et al., 2014, Hauch, 2003). This paper fits into this literature by decomposing electricity trade’s scale and composition effect on carbon emissions.==== The calibrated simulation also provides suggestive evidence on the magnitude of the effects.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the model setup. Section 3 presents the benchmark case of countries under autarky. Section 4 provides a theoretical analysis of the Clean–Dirty and Clean–Clean interconnection. Section 5 presents the calibrated simulation exercise, and Section 6 provides a final overview.",Electricity interconnection with intermittent renewables,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069622000328,9 April 2022,2022,Research Article,81.0

However, race, ethnicity, and language also play important roles after conditioning upon these variables, suggesting an environmental injustice and a breakdown of efficient Coasian bargaining. We further demonstrate that failure to negotiate protections in leases leads to increased risk of future drilling violations, and that weak lease restrictions are not generally offset by strong local ordinance restrictions.","Changes in oil and natural gas extraction technology have brought households closer than ever to drilling operations. Whereas drilling activity was once confined to rural regions, shale wells, facilitated by horizontal drilling techniques, now impact suburban households owning sub-acre lots. When the rights to extractable minerals are privately owned, firms must negotiate individual leases with each affected household. Consequently, landowners have an opportunity to protect their families and property from negative drilling externalities not already regulated by the state. These protections can include limits to noise, traffic, road usage, site restoration, and restrictions on chemical compounds used for fracking, pre-drilling soil and water testing, among others. Leases play an important role in the ==== regulatory process, and while it may be difficult to contend that the lease negotiation process satisfies all of the conditions for efficient Coasian bargaining, it is often argued that privately negotiated protections in lease agreements can substitute for a more bureaucratic and burdensome regulatory regime. However, contracts are individually negotiated and not all leases are the same – in particular, leases may include more or fewer landowner protections. To the extent that these differences in bargaining outcomes reflect differences in willingess to pay to avoid the externalities associated with drilling, they can still signal an efficient Coasian bargaining process (Coase, 1960). To the extent that they correspond to other household characteristics (e.g., race and language), differences in lease outcomes will suggest that negotiations are inefficient. Moreover, given the drilling externalities involved, they may be also an important source of environmental injustice.====Because each lease is individually negotiated between large leasing and drilling firms and landowners, we frame the negotiations as outcomes of Coasian bargaining. Coase (1960) suggests that under a strict set of assumptions, including (i) minimal transactions costs, (ii) well-defined property rights, and (iii) agents that are symmetrically well-informed, an efficient bargain would be struck under which the external cost of the last unit of pollution to victims would equal its benefit to the polluter. Transfers ensure that no one is made worse off as a result, and depending upon bargaining power, the bargaining solution may represent an improvement for all parties. This result is compelling and has long been used to justify a laissez faire approach to the government's management of polluting activities. In some contexts, the assumptions underlying Coase's theorem are largely satisfied. However, a problem arises in many environmental justice contexts when information is less accessible to certain groups. This may be the case, for example, if language creates a barrier to effective negotiation. More generally, racial discrimination may make it difficult for certain groups to bargain effectively. Indeed, there have been many instances in the past where race (and especially linguistic isolation) have been used to influence negotiations about the location of pollution sources.====Our assembled data uniquely allows us to study the outcomes of privately negotiated contracts and link these outcomes to household characteristics. We find consistent evidence that minority households receive worse contracts along nearly all dimensions, and the effects are compounded by linguistic barriers to bargaining, suggesting an important information asymmetry. Further, we explore how these effects interact with other observable and potentially correlated determinants of bargaining outcomes by estimating a non-parametric, Chaid-algorithm moment forest model. That model shows that minorities’ negative outcomes are stronger for linguistically isolated, poorer, and less educated minority populations.====Our empirical models allow us to directly test whether private negotiations lead to equitable and efficient allocations of legal rights and responsibilities as suggested by the Coasian framework. We conclude that leasing in the oil and natural gas industry is neither equitable nor efficient. Making matters worse, we find that the stringency of local ordinances is correlated with the quality of shale gas leases, meaning that landowners who are unable to successfully negotiate for protections will not find relief though local regulations that oversee drilling activities.====To analyze these questions, we combine data describing household characteristics, including racial and ethnic composition and annual income levels, with property characteristics and contracting outcomes, including specific clauses agreed upon by drilling firms and landowners. We then estimate a Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) model of contract composition, which tests whether certain household and property characteristics are more or less likely to lead to certain contract outcomes. Controlling for income, evidence from the SUR model suggests that minority households receive fewer protections, and the more linguistically isolated the household, the fewer the protections. For example, we find that a Hispanic household living in a Census Tract that is 100% Spanish speaking will have a probability of having an environmental clause in their lease that is 8.7 percentage points lower than a Hispanic household in a Census Tract with no Spanish speaking households. This effect is large, with 19.5% of households having an environmental clause on average. Results are similar for other lease clauses. Second, we show that these results are robust to using alternative methods for coding race and ethnicity. Specifically, we employ the Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG) algorithm, which uses surnames and neighborhood composition to predict a household's likely racial and ethnic composition.==== Our conclusions hold up to using this alternative measure of race and ethnicity. Third, in order to characterize how different household characteristics interact, we estimate non-parametric, heterogeneous effects of being a minority household using a moment forest model adapted from computer science (Asher et al., 2016). We apply the model to the SUR framework whereby we simultaneously estimate a set of equations. With the technique, we are able to measure how effects on minorities vary along multiple interacting dimensions including linguistic isolation, median household income, and levels of educational attainment. With these additional dimensions of heterogeneity, we conclude that lease outcomes are worse for minority households that are not only poorer and less educated, but also linguistically isolated. Finally, we test whether these differences in bargaining outcomes are salient for long-run outcomes. In particular, are more restrictive contracts associated with fewer violations? We find that this is indeed the case. This confluence of results suggests potential environmental injustice in the market for privately negotiated natural gas leases.====This paper touches on a number of relevant literatures. In particular, we explore whether the leasing process is consistent with efficient Coasian bargaining, or whether there are other factors (in particular, factors that could be associated more directly with race and language) that also play a role. Our work is therefore related to the literatures on the Coase Theorem and environmental justice. Environmental justice has a rich interdisciplinary history; for a discussion from an economics perspective, see Banzhaf et al. (2019) and Banzhaf et al. (2019). For an overview of the Coase Theorem we refer the reader to one of several reviews (Schweizer, 1988; Medema, 1994, 2020; Zelder, 1998). Jenkins et al. (2004) and Hamilton (1995) explore the efficiency of the Coasian bargaining process. Finally, because we focus on the effect of lease negotiations on exposure to the nuisances associated with shale gas extraction, the literature on the health impacts of that exposure is also relevant (Colborn et al., 2011; McKenzie et al., 2012; Bamberger and Oswald, 2012; Hill, 2018). Other papers have focused specifically on exposures through drinking water (Vengosh et al., 2014; Hill and Ma, 2017a,b).====This paper proceeds as follows.

Brown Zachary Steven,"Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics, North Carolina State University, USA","Received 11 February 2021, Revised 7 March 2022, Accepted 23 March 2022, Available online 7 April 2022, Version of Record 16 April 2022.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeem.2022.102654,Cited by (4),I examine how ,"A growing body of recent research investigates the impact that income inequality can have on willingness to pay (WTP) for nonmarket environmental goods and services (Baumgärtner et al., 2017). This research is no doubt motivated in part by trends of increasing income inequality around the world and by recognition that such inequality can affect both the political economy and distributional impacts of environmental policies (Drupp et al., 2018; Piketty 2014; UNDESA 2020). In terms of methods for environmental valuation, it has also been shown that income inequality can have direct importance for the practice of benefit transfer (Baumgärtner et al., 2017; Meya et al., 2021).====In the context of environmental valuation, less well studied is how inequality affects the disparity between WTP for a prospective environmental benefit and willingness to accept (WTA) the forfeiture of that benefit. This gap in the research literature is somewhat surprising: Baumgärtner et al. (2017), in their theoretical analysis of how income inequality affects marginal WTP (MWTP), draws heavily on previous research showing that the income elasticity of MWTP should inversely relate to the elasticity of substitution between income and environmental goods (Ebert 2003; Kovenock and Sadka 1981). That same result continues to provide one of the only possible (albeit contested) explanations from rational choice theory for well-documented disparities between WTP and WTA (Hanemann 1991), a disparity which tends to be higher for nonmarket goods (Horowitz and McConnell 2002; Tunçel and Hammitt 2014).====Another active research question around inequality and the environment is the extent to which nonmarket environmental benefits are distributed unequally in society. Environmental degradation has often been found to be distributed regressively with income, to fall disproportionately on groups with lower socioeconomic status (Brooks and Sethi 1997; Mohai et al. 2009; Hajat, Hsia and O'Neill 2015), and to fall on specific ethnic and racial groups even when controlling for socioeconomic factors (Mohai et al., 2009; Mikati et al., 2018; Banzhaf et al. 2019). However, little research to date has analyzed how these disparities affect nonmarket economic valuation of these impacts (Meya 2020 provides a notable exception, which I address later in the paper). Drupp et al. (2018) observe that unequal distributions of nonmarket benefits, in conjunction with income inequality, can codetermine overall distributional effects of environmental policies.====These topics – how WTP, WTA and their difference are affected in distinct ways by joint inequality in income and nonmarket goods – are the focus of this paper. In addition to the above literature, a primary motivation for this study is how WTP-WTA disparities relate to benefit-cost analysis (BCA). As Hammitt (2015) and others have observed, since BCA was the original impetus for nonmarket valuation, it is important to consider how WTP-WTA disparities affect BCA. As Hammitt reminds readers, the WTP and WTA estimates underlying BCA are for evaluating “whether the benefits to some justify the harms of others.” Intuitively, we would expect that inequality in the effects of environmental policies must directly relate to this question.====In this paper, I investigate how the degree of divergence between the Kaldor-Hicks compensation tests – which provide the theoretical foundations for BCA – depends on the degree of inequality in both income and nonmarket goods.==== For the Kaldor test, the question for BCA is whether the beneficiaries of a policy could hypothetically compensate the losers so that no one is worse off following implementation, a test corresponding to the use of compensating variation (CV) as the valuation measure. The Hicks test is whether the potentially injured parties could hypothetically compensate the potential beneficiaries to a degree that the latter would be willing to forego policy implementation, corresponding to the use of equivalent variation (EV) as the valuation measure. De Scitovszky (1941) was the first to observe that results from these two tests need not agree with one another, due to their differences in which state of the world is given priority: As Hammitt (====) and others (e.g. Knetsch 2010) have explained, these different criteria reflect different judgements on which parties – the beneficiaries or the injured – have a right to their preferred state of the world. I analyze here how the divergence of these two criteria relates to the distribution of income and nonmarket goods.====This paper proceeds by first laying out the general theoretical framework I use throughout the analysis and establishing some basic results. I then apply this framework to the specific case of Cobb-Douglas preferences over income and an environmental good. Despite its restrictiveness, the Cobb-Douglas case is useful for obtaining clear results about how divergent conclusions from BCA relate to moments of the joint distribution of income and nonmarket goods. I illustrate the import of these results in two simple examples. In the penultimate section, I extend some of this analysis to more general preferences exhibiting a constant elasticity of substitution (CES). To conclude, I discuss what this collection of findings implies for nonmarket valuation used in BCA and related welfare analyses and what it suggests about the scope for bargaining when policies have distributional impacts.","Distributional policy impacts, WTP-WTA disparities, and the Kaldor-Hicks tests in benefit-cost analysis",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009506962200033X,7 April 2022,2022,Research Article,83.0

Our results show that LEEP Plus does not affect natural gas consumption but reduces electricity consumption by approximately 7%, with greater savings occurring in the summer and winter. The effect on electricity consumption is significant to a variety of robustness checks and remains for at least 24 months after the completion of energy efficiency upgrades. We also measure some relevant heterogeneous effects, one of which is the breakdown of the air-conditioning-related investments, the main energy efficiency improvement under the LEEP Plus program. Finally, we evaluate the energy savings in monetary terms considering the private cost changes and the social cost changes. In both cases, the associated energy savings are not enough to offset the investment costs.","U.S. electric utilities are rapidly expanding their energy efficiency programs (Barbose et al., 2013) and, in particular, ==== have become a major component of cities’ energy policy, with 49 out of 51 largest metropolitan areas in the U.S. offering at least one such program (Drehobl and Castro-Alvarez, 2017). These programs aim to save energy while reducing the energy costs for low-income families by increasing the energy efficiency of their homes –e.g., by replacing or repairing their Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. The expected energy savings generated by the investments are based on ex-ante predictions from engineering models which are based on savings that occur under ideal conditions such as laboratory settings with controlled weather, optimal equipment usage, and so on. However, once residential users undertake investment in energy efficiency improvements, the actual dwelling conditions and household characteristics, as well as the changes in consumer behavior, may lead to lower energy savings than originally expected, the so-called rebound effect (see for example, Greening et al., 2000, Sorrell et al., 2009; or Gillingham et al., 2016).==== In addition, the existing evidence on the actual returns to energy efficiency investment in the residential sector is mixed and to some extent scarce.====This paper uses data from Gainesville Regional Utility (GRU), the dominant utility company in Gainesville, Florida, to quantify the impacts of the housing investment done by its low-income energy efficiency program (LEEP Plus) on energy consumption. The program assists low-income households with home improvements that can lower their electric bill, improve comfort, and reduce energy use.==== On average, beneficiary households in our sample received around $3,780 worth of improvement upgrades, with no out-of-pocket expense incurred. Our monthly panel data covers the period 2012 to 2019 and includes the energy consumption of single-family homes that participated in the program between 2012 and 2018, as well as the consumption of all the remaining single-family homes in GRU’s service area. Our program records include households that applied to the program but did not receive any upgrades (untreated applicants). We estimate the effect of the program on electricity and natural gas consumption by comparing patterns of energy consumption among treated and untreated applicants, thereby mitigating the issue of self-selection into the program. We show that our results are robust to the selection of the comparison group and alternative specifications, and we also present a falsification test using the sample of untreated applicants. In addition to energy consumption data, we have data containing the list of upgrades that where implemented in each home with the assistance of the program, as well as the costs associated with these investments. Thus we estimate the heterogeneous effects of some relevant investment combos related to air-conditioning measures separately. In addition, we present the heterogeneous effects by season (winter, spring, summer, and fall) and by home energy source. We also compare the private energy savings and social cost savings with the corresponding investment costs by calculating the energy savings for each household separately as done in Novan and Smith (2018).====Our results indicate that participation in the LEEP program reduces monthly electricity consumption by more than 7% with the largest savings occurring in the summer (8.4%) and winter (8.9%) months, while no effects are found on natural gas consumption. These results are robust to a variety of robustness checks and persist over time for at least 24 months after the completion of energy efficiency upgrades. When looking at the monetary savings, both the private savings –i.e., reduction in energy bills– and the social cost savings are not enough to recover the investments made in energy efficiency improvements and the payback periods exceed the expected lifespan of electric appliances for the vast majority of consumers. Based on the household level effects and grouping users into electricity consumption quartiles, the results indicate that high-consumption users are more likely to be profitable since investment costs do not differ much among quartiles. Moreover, when looking at the heterogeneous effects of AC-related investment types,==== we identify particular investment combos that are more likely to be cost-effective.====It is worth mentioning that there might be other possible considerations that justify the implementation of this type of programs that go beyond the energy savings achieved by end-users. One possibility is that they provide grid stability and/or reduce demand at peak hours (see, for example, Fels and Keating, 1993, or Boomhower and Davis, 2020). The latter is particularly important during the summer months in Florida, especially in the afternoon when it is considerably hot and humid. Since electricity cannot be stored and batteries are still very expensive, using this sort of demand-side management strategy helps the electricity company to reduce its generation costs.==== In addition, there might be other benefits not measured in terms of electricity savings. For example, improvements on participants’ health, especially if they are vulnerable and have limited resources to pay for medical care (Maidment et al., 2014). Similarly, the decline in absenteeism from work and school has an associated positive economic impact. In this paper we only focus on direct electricity consumption savings due to the LEEP Plus program.====This paper makes two important contributions to the literature. First, it increases the evidence base on the true returns to residential energy efficiency investments done by programs targeting low-income families. Despite the increasing body of evidence, there is still much to be learned about how well energy-efficiency investments work in practice (Allcott and Greenstone, 2012; Davis et al., 2020). In particular, we present evidence of the impacts produced by a small-scale program implemented by a local utility in a warmer climate. Importantly, our results are relevant for policy, given that the energy-efficiency improvements offered by GRU are quite similar to those offered by comparable programs among the 51 largest metropolitan areas in the U.S.====Residential energy consumption is sensitive to the climate, yet, the evidence across different locations is scarce. Our focus on a warmer climate differentiates this paper from existing literature on energy efficiency which has focused on other types of climates in the U.S. For instance, Fowlie et al. (2018) estimate the returns to the efficiency upgrades for low-income households done by the Department of Energy’s Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) using a sample of households in Michigan, where the summers are warm, and the winters are frigid. Zivin and Novan (2016) study the Energy Savings Assistance Program, which provides free energy efficiency upgrades to low income households in San Diego, California, where the summers are short and warm, and the winters are long and cool. However, their main focus is on disentangling the effects of the efficiency upgrades from the behavioral treatment.==== This paper focuses on Florida, which has a humid subtropical climate in the north and tropical in the south. It is the warmest of all-American states, as well as the state that experiences the most precipitation.====Our second contribution is related to the significant heterogeneous effects that we find and that ultimately translate into relevant policy recommendations. First, we highlight that savings are more pronounced during the winter and summer seasons when temperatures are more extreme. Second, and related to that, we construct energy-efficiency improvement combos and measure the energy saving potential of each one.==== We identify these combos using a hierarchical clustering analysis, given that the improvements are not implemented in isolation, but rather they are made in a complementary fashion. In our context, those upgrades related to room air conditioning (cooling and heating) using electricity are the most relevant because they represent about 90% of the improvements.==== On the other hand, when we study the families individually, we find that those with higher energy consumption (i.e., those belonging to the fourth quartile of pre-treatment electricity consumption) are more likely to achieve cost-effective results. It is so because the cost of the investments is relatively stable across quartiles, while the observed savings increase with pre-treatment average consumption. The previous points are particularly relevant given that low-income energy-efficiency programs have been questioned precisely in terms of their efficacy: energy-efficiency investments provide relatively low energy savings at the expense of sizeable amounts of government transfers. If that is the case, identifying cost-effective energy-efficiency upgrades and improving the targeting of beneficiaries could be helpful in determining investment priorities. Such type of differential policies should be implemented in order to achieve similar goals (i.e., distributional, environmental, and energy efficiency) within a smaller budget.====More broadly, this paper adds to the literature on residential energy efficiency, including Davis et al. (2014), which evaluate a large-scale appliance replacement program in Mexico; Jacobsen and Kotchen (2013) and Levinson (2016), which focus on the energy savings associated with building code standards in Florida and California, respectively; Houde and Aldy (2017) on the consumers’ response to energy efficiency rebates; Davis et al. (2020), which study energy efficiency on new homes in Mexico; Boampong (2020), which evaluate the energy-savings effects of the 2009 GRU’s high-efficiency AC rebate program; and an extensive list of academic papers.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the framework and describes the details of GRU’s program. Section 3 describes the data and provides summary statistics. Section 4 describes the empirical strategy and presents the estimation results. Section 5 reports the main results on actual savings at the household level, grouping consumers into consumption quartiles and comparing private savings and social savings with investments costs. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper and provides policy implications.",Low-income energy efficiency programs and energy consumption,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069622000341,5 April 2022,2022,Research Article,84.0

If the coalition is sufficiently small or its energy demand is sufficiently price sensitive, both the initial extraction and the cumulative discounted climate damages decrease (no weak/strong green paradox). This also applies if exploration investments are sufficiently productive, so that a lower fuel price leads to a considerably lower total extraction. If the coalition acts strategically in the fossil fuel market, it accounts for terms-of-trade and carbon-leakage effects. Then, a higher marginal climate damage can lead to an ==== of the coalition’s cumulative fuel consumption, which prevents a weak green paradox, while a strong green paradox never occurs.====In an empirically calibrated economy, we show that a strong green paradox can occur without a weak green paradox and vice versa with a price-taking coalition. With a strategically acting coalition, a weak green paradox can be part of a unilaterally optimal policy reaction.","The climate problem with its international and intertemporal dimensions is one of the greatest challenges of our time. Down to the present day, its public good character has prevented the existence of an effective global climate agreement (UN, 2021 p. 36). In the absence of such an agreement, a coordinated climate policy by a subgroup of countries can be second best. However, such a policy should account for terms-of-trade and carbon-leakage effects to keep the financial burden low and lift the climate effectiveness up.====There is yet another problem with any climate policy: If it becomes more stringent over time, then it can persuade owners of exhaustible resources to shift their extraction into the present in order to escape lower prices in the future. This weak green paradox occurs in case of, e.g., a sufficiently steep carbon tax path (Sinn, 2008, Hoel, 2012), the credible announcement of a future carbon tax (van der Ploeg, 2016 pp. 91), or the subsidization of a backstop technology (Gerlagh, 2011, van der Ploeg and Withagen, 2012). However, in consideration of stock-dependent extraction costs, these climate policies typically reduce total extraction.==== If this effect is outweighed by the weak green paradox, such that the present value of the cumulative climate damages increases, then the strong green paradox occurs.====Most of the green paradox literature is on exogenous policy changes. By contrast, little attention has been paid to second-best climate policies and this phenomenon. As van der Ploeg (2016, pp. 94) points out, it can be unilaterally optimal to increase the environmental stringency over time and allow the weak green paradox to occur if the corresponding climate policy reduces total extraction or improves the terms of trade.==== In our two-country model, a stricter unilateral climate policy is triggered by a reevaluation of environmental preferences, i.e. by an increase in the marginal climate damage. We show that the corresponding policy reaction can lead to the weak and the strong green paradox even if policy changes affect exploration investments and the climate coalition ignores terms-of-trade effects. In this case, early emissions increase although the increase in the implicit carbon price is constant over time, which contrasts with the results of the green paradox literature on exogenous policy changes.====We differentiate between a price-taking and a strategically acting climate coalition. In the former case, the coalition ignores terms-of-trade and carbon-leakage effects. Then, a reevaluation of environmental preferences induces the coalition to raise its domestic fossil fuel price at any point of time by a constant amount, which reduces its cumulative fossil fuel imports. This depresses the fossil fuel price, which reduces exploration investments and, thus, total emissions, but raises the fossil fuel consumption of the fringe. It turns out that the existence of both a weak and a strong green paradox depends on the exploration costs, the size of the climate coalition and the price sensitivity of the coalition’s energy demand. If exploration is cheap (ceteris paribus), exploration investments are considerably reduced, which counters carbon leakage. The latter is small if the coalition is small, so that a policy change has only a weak impact on the fossil fuel price. Finally, if the coalition’s energy demand is very price sensitive, a stricter climate policy leads to a considerable reduction of the coalition’s fuel consumption, which then outweighs carbon leakage to the fringe.====If the coalition acts strategically, it takes into account how its climate policy affects the fossil fuel price, which gives rise to a terms-of-trade effect and a carbon-leakage effect. The former describes the coalition’s incentive to reduce its import bill by depressing the fossil fuel price. Due the latter, the coalition considers how the fringe’s fuel consumption is affected by its climate policy. Since carbon leakage is the driving force behind emissions increases, the strong green paradox is ruled out. The weak green paradox is avoided if the coalition is small and its energy demand very price sensitive. The former implies that the coalition has weak incentives to reduce its import bill, while the latter ensures that carbon leakage is outweighed by less fuel consumption of the coalition.====To shed more light on the conditions that lead to a green paradox, we turn to an empirically calibrated economy. In case of a price-taking climate coalition, a weak green paradox occurs if the coalition’s energy demand is sufficiently price insensitive compared to that of the fringe. This weak green paradox is accompanied by a strong green paradox if the fringe’s energy demand is sufficiently price sensitive, which fosters carbon leakage. By contrast, the present value of the cumulative climate damages decreases if the fringe’s energy demand is sufficiently price insensitive. Then, the increase in early emissions is outweighed by the decrease in later emissions. Finally, the strong green paradox occurs without the weak green paradox if early emissions are only lightly reduced whereas later emissions are considerably increased. This can be the case if the fringe’s energy demand is very price sensitive. If the coalition acts strategically, the weak green paradox again occurs if the coalition’s energy demand is sufficiently price insensitive compared to that of the fringe, but the condition is much stronger and the increase in early emissions is much weaker than in case of a price-taking climate coalition.====Our results are driven by the consideration of more than one country and more than two periods. In such a framework, Hoel (2011) is the first to analyze the effects of a unilateral policy change on the extraction path. He finds that the weak and the strong green paradox do [not] occur if the constant carbon tax is increased in the low-tax country [high-tax country] and the energy demand is perfectly price inelastic.==== We extend this analysis by the consideration of exploration investments, heterogeneous consumers, implying heterogeneous energy demands, and by the derivation of the unilaterally optimal policy with and without strategic action and its change induced by a higher marginal climate damage. Ryszka and Withagen (2016) consider a low-cost resource and a high-cost resource, both are eventually exhausted, and also consider heterogeneous consumers. They find that the weak green paradox occurs if the constant carbon tax is increased in the high-tax country and the low-cost resource is sufficiently scarce.==== In a numerical example, they show that the unilaterally optimal constant carbon tax is greater than the marginal climate damage and improves the terms of trade. Our analytical derivation of the unilaterally optimal policy in case of a strategically acting coalition demonstrates that the optimal implicit carbon price is not constant over time and can even become negative if the carbon-leakage effect is sufficiently strong. ====Fischer and Salant (2017) also consider a low-cost resource and a high-cost resource, but only the low-cost resource is eventually exhausted. They find that both countries reduce their high-cost resource consumption if the constant (in real terms) carbon tax is increased in the high-tax country. Since they focus on meeting a global carbon budget with alternative policy options, they do not derive a general condition for the weak green paradox to occur or the unilaterally optimal policy. Kollenbach (2019) integrates stock-dependent extraction costs and heterogeneous consumers into Hoel’s (2011) model. He finds that neither the weak nor the strong green paradox occurs if the climate policy of the high-tax country becomes more stringent and the resource and the backstop are used simultaneously. Finally, van der Meijden et al. (2018) analyze the effects of a unilateral policy change on the extraction path with monopolistic fossil fuel supply. They specify conditions under which the weak green paradox does not occur if the constant carbon tax or the constant backstop subsidy is increased. In accordance with our analysis, they find that the extraction paths prior and post policy change can intersect more than once, but they do not derive a general condition for the strong green paradox to occur.====

We also find that ozone and carbon monoxide impact weight-related outcomes. Stunting has critical long-term health and economic consequences; through its impact on stunting, pollution exacerbates the height premium in earnings, with girls being more adversely affected than boys in India.","Air pollution is a global health threat with 7 million deaths attributable to the joint effects of household and ambient air pollution in 2016 (WHO, 2016, Cohen et al., 2017). About 94% of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. In addition, air pollution causes acute respiratory infections, blindness, heart diseases, low birth weight and stillbirth (Branca and Ferrari, 2002, Dewey and Begum, 2011, Hoddinott et al., 2013, Feng et al., 2019).====In economics, a large body of literature attempts to document the causal impacts of pollution on different health outcomes (Chay and Greenstone, 2003, Currie and Neidell, 2005, Currie et al., 2009, Jayachandran, 2009, Currie and Walker, 2011, Moretti and Neidell, 2011, Arceo et al., 2016, Knittel et al., 2016, Schlenker and Walker, 2016, Deryugina et al., 2019). An overwhelming share of these studies focuses on the developed world, exploring the link between pollution and mortality or respiratory and heart-related hospitalizations.====Using data from India, this paper studies the impact of air pollution on child growth indicators, such as stunting and wasting. Children are stunted for their age and gender when their height is more than two standard deviations below the World Health Organization (WHO) Child Growth Standards median. Stunting is of high relevance for public health and economic policies, being associated with critical short- and long-term physical and socio-economic disadvantages (for a review, see Currie and Vogl, 2013). In the short term, stunting is linked to (i) weakened immune systems and higher risk of infection (Rodríguez et al., 2011, Schlaudecker et al., 2011); (ii) lower cognitive development (Pollitt et al., 1995, Brown and Pollitt, 1996, Case and Paxson, 2008a); (iii) adverse educational achievements (Maluccio et al., 2009, Hoddinott et al., 2013); and (iv) higher mortality rates (Caulfield et al., 2004, Olofin et al., 2013). Evidence on the negative long-term consequences of stunting is growing, with stunted children being more likely to experience (i) short stature in adulthood (Tanner et al., 1956, Sachdev et al., 2005, Gigante et al., 2009); (ii) reduced cognitive skills (Glewwe and Miguel, 2007, Guven and Lee, 2015), (iii) functional limitations, such as reduced work capacity (Spurr, 1988); (iv) higher risks of obesity and chronic diseases (Gluckman et al., 2007); (v) lower income and wealth (Hoddinott et al., 2008, Case and Paxson, 2008a, Almond and Currie, 2010), (v) poorer marriage outcomes (Hoddinott et al., 2013); and (vi) worse reproductive outcomes, such as lower birthweight of offsprings (Victora et al., 2008), having firstborns at younger ages, and more pregnancies and children (Hoddinott et al., 2013).====Air pollution is expected to affect child growth and development through its impact on respiratory diseases and the loss of nutrients when fighting infectious agents (Schlaudecker et al., 2011). The existing literature has so far focused on estimating the correlation between child stunting and air pollution, in particular household air pollution. When assessing the link between air pollution and health outcomes, OLS estimates are likely biased due to measurement errors and omitted variables (Duflo et al., 2008b, Greenstone and Jack, 2015, Deryugina et al., 2019). Households are usually not randomly exposed to different levels of air pollution, in particular indoor pollution, and their exposure correlates with a multitude of factors that are also likely to impact child health. For example, the use of specific fuel types for cooking, which directly impacts air pollution levels, correlates highly with household wealth and education. Poorer households may be more likely to have both stunted children and choose free or cheap fuel sources (like dung or wood gathered from nearby fields or forests) (Duflo et al., 2008a).====This study focuses on India as a case-in-point for a developing economy with persistently high levels of stunting and increasing air pollution (Greenstone and Hanna, 2014, Banerjee and Dwivedi, 2020). We combine anthropometric and socio-economic data from the Indian National Family Health Survey 2015/2016 (hereafter NFHS-4) with granular information on air pollutant concentrations, wind direction, wind speed, and weather variables from the second Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2) from NASA’s atmospheric reanalysis of satellite data. This unique dataset allows us to estimate the causal impact of air pollution on child growth by exploiting the quasi-random variation in pollution attributable to the transportation of pollutants by wind. We focus on three criteria pollutants, ==== fine particulate matter (PM====), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O====), and show their disparate impacts on height- and weight-related child growth outcomes.====Based on a long time-series of hourly data, we build aggregate measures of frequency of wind direction and pollution concentrations that reflect the personal exposure of each child in our sample from the gestational period till the time of the interview. Employing an instrumental variable (IV) approach, we use the exogenous variation in wind direction to instrument for local pollution concentrations and estimate the impact of pollution on anthropometric measurements for children.====With our methodology, we join the recent literature that explores changes in wind direction as an exogenous source of variation in air pollution for assessing health impacts. Deryugina et al. (2019) use changes in daily average wind direction as an instrument for variation in daily average fine particulate matter concentrations to identify its effect on mortality and health care use in the US. Anderson (2020) investigates the impact of air pollution on adult mortality by using variation in wind orientation with respect to highways in the Los Angeles area. Sheldon and Sankaran (2017) use wind direction and the occurrence of Indonesian fires to instrument air pollution in Singapore and study the impact of pollution on respiratory diseases. Similar identification strategies have also been used when researching the impact of wildfires on different health outcomes (Jayachandran, 2009, Pullabhotla, 2018, Rangel and Vogl, 2019).====Our analysis shows that an increase by one standard deviation in average annual outdoor PM==== concentrations increases the frequency of stunting and severe stunting by 5 and 2.4 percentage points, respectively. We also find that ozone and carbon monoxide impact weight-related outcomes. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that, if average pollution levels in India were brought down to WHO recommended standards, i.e., an eightfold reduction from current levels, the shares of stunted and severe stunted children would decrease by 10.4 and 5.17 percentage points, respectively, ====. This would correspond to approximately 14.3 million less stunted children in India.====We perform a series of heterogeneity analyses by age, gender, birth order, and place of residence and show how impacts can vary across these dimensions, pointing, among others, to important cultural practices that shape the effects of pollution on child growth. Moreover, we rely on an aggregated air quality index to estimate the joint impact of the different criteria pollutants on the child growth indicators. A series of tests demonstrates the robustness of our results. The findings are stable to changing the aggregation level of the data and accounting for spatial correlation in the error terms. Moreover, the results are consistent when employing an alternative IV approach, where we restrict the sample to include only children living close to the coastline and use the share of time wind is blowing from the sea as an instrument for air pollution.====The consequences of air pollution exposure, similar to other health shocks during childhood, are expected to be long-lasting. Based on estimates from the literature, we compute the additional contribution of air pollution exposure to the well-known height premium in earnings and find that an increase in PM==== by one standard deviation during childhood translates into lost yearly earnings in adulthood in the range of 1.4%–1.8% for men and 1.6%–2% for women, pointing to a potential new dimension of the gender gap in India.====Our paper contributes to the existing literature by being, to the best of our knowledge, one of the first papers to perform a causal estimation of the impacts of air pollution on child growth outcomes. Moreover, it focuses on India, one of the largest emerging economies and, currently, among the most polluted places in the world. So far, only a handful of economic papers have focused on identifying the causal impact of air pollution on health outcomes in the context of a developing country (Jayachandran, 2009, Chen et al., 2013, Arceo et al., 2016, Deschenes et al., 2020). Existing evidence comes from Indonesia, Mexico, and China with a focus on infant and elderly mortality. If the pollution–health relation is convex or the costs of avoidance behavior are different in developing countries (Arceo et al., 2016), it is important to understand what the impacts at high levels of pollution are. Our paper is somewhat close to Deschenes et al. (2020), who use thermal inversions to instrument for the impact of PM==== on adult weight and obesity in China. In contrast to their findings, we find no evidence that PM==== significantly affects the weight-for-age and weight-related growth outcomes of children in India; however, we do find that these outcomes are negatively impacted by ozone and carbon monoxide, two other important criteria pollutants not considered in their analysis. Our paper is also one of the first to study the joint impact of the three main criteria pollutants on child health, decreasing the risk of overestimating the impact of one particular pollutant when included separately, as in most previous studies.====Our results indicate that the negative impacts of pollution on child development are substantial, underlying once again the urgency to reduce air pollution in India. In light of recent evidence that the willingness to pay for clean air is extremely low in India (Greenstone et al., 2021), it seems that change will not be led by, at least in the short term, citizen-led initiatives, but needs to be mediated by policy makers.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

We analyze this issue for the demand of an innovative weather insurance product. Specifically, when does informal risk-sharing act as barrier or support to the take-up of index-based insurance? The presence of an individual in a risk-sharing arrangement reduces her risk aversion, termed “Effective Risk Aversion”— a ==== for index decision making. Our analysis establishes that such reduction in risk aversion can lead to either reduced or increased take up of index insurance. These results provide alternative explanations for two empirical puzzles: unexpectedly low takeup for index insurance and demand being particularly low for the most risk averse. From a policy perspective, our results highlight how the combination of premium subsidies and informal networks might promote take-up and how this might eventually facilitate better protection against weather risks.","Weather is a major source of income risk, especially in low-income and agrarian environments. Recently, innovative index-based weather insurance has emerged as a way to help society insure against weather related events.==== The standard index-based contract pays out when some constructed-index (e.g., rainfall, temperature) falls below or above a given non-manipulable threshold. While index contracts overcome several market frictions – e.g., moral hazard, that plague traditional indemnity-based insurance and financial instruments – such insurance innovation comes with a cost: “basis risk” (Clarke, 2016). In particular, there is a potential mismatch between the payouts triggered by the local weather and the actual losses associated with weather realizations of the insurance policy holder. This mismatch or “basis risk” arises because weather realized on an individual farm unit may not perfectly correlate with the local weather index — whose construction is typically based on observations recorded at weather stations that surround the policy holder.====Because of its economic importance, several empirical studies have recently emerged about weather index-based insurance (see, Giné and Yang, 2009, Giné et al., 2008, Cole et al., 2013, Mobarak and Rosenzweig, 2012, Karlan et al., 2014, Casaburi and Willis, 2018), which in turn have noted two fundamental puzzles. The first is that, demand for index products has been lower than expected.==== The second is that, the demand seems to be especially low from the most risk averse consumers. Despite its promise, scaling up index insurance will require our understanding about the various constraints to its take-up. Indeed, variations in index take-up may exist, but basis risk cannot explain the variations in take-up for the same index contract for the same location (i.e., with similar conditions). So what may drive such variations in index demand? We explore how the two barriers (price and basis risk) may bear on existing risk institutions to explain the thin index insurance market in poor populations.====The extent to which informal risk-sharing institutions affect the demand for index-based insurance remains an open question, both empirically and theoretically. In this paper, we focus on microfounded reasons underlying the relation between informal risk schemes and formal index insurance. Specifically, we ask: ==== We analyze this question by showing how the presence of an informal risk-sharing arrangement affect an individual’s purchase decisions about index insurance. Our analysis show that the presence of an individual in a risk sharing arrangement reduces her risk aversion — a phenomenon we term “Effective Risk Aversion”. The paper documents that “Effective Risk Aversion” is a paramount statistic that underlies individual’s purchase decisions about index-based insurance.====Appealing to “Effective Risk Aversion”, it is shown that informal schemes may either reduce or increase the take-up of index insurance. The main intuition follows from the simple observation that in the presence of a risk-sharing arrangement, an individual’s risk tolerance is higher. This has two implications for the take-up of index insurance. First, the individual being more risk-tolerant makes her less willing to buy insurance. Second, the individual being more tolerant makes her less averse to basis risk, and so increases her willingness to buy index insurance. These two forces thus have opposite effects on the decision to purchase index insurance. As an illustration, consider a highly risk averse individual who in the absence of a risk-sharing group will not buy index insurance because of her aversion to basis risk. Being in a group reduces her risk aversion “effectively” making her more tolerant towards basis risk and thus more likely to purchase index insurance. Now consider the case of an individual with intermediate risk aversion who would buy index insurance if acting alone. The presence of informal insurance may crowd out her take-up for index insurance due to her lower willingness to pay.====The question of how informal institutions interact with formal markets has been a central economic question (Arnott and Stiglitz, 1991, Kranton, 1996). Indeed, this is an important question when we consider the adoption of emerging products in developing countries (see, World Development Report, 2014). Our paper is related to the broader literatures on risk sharing (Townsend, 1994, Munshi, 2011) and the uptake of index insurance (Giné et al., 2008, Mobarak and Rosenzweig, 2012, Cole et al., 2013, Karlan et al., 2014, Clarke, 2016, Casaburi and Willis, 2018). We extend previous work by identifying and emphasizing the “effective risk aversion” or changes in attitudes channel for the development of formal markets. Specific to index contracts, however, our analysis rationalizes two empirical puzzles: demand being unexpectedly low and the more risk averse individuals not taking up index contracts. Our result that effective risk aversion affects index insurance decisions highlights the role that risk-sharing and preferences play in household finance decisions. This connects to Mazzocco (2004) which studies the decision to save within the household when members can possibly have different risk preferences, showing that risk sharing via informal networks and risk preferences are important determinants.====Climate change is a major issue at the intersection of environment and development (see e.g., Greenstone and Jack, 2015 for a review). The potential role of insurance and community in managing climatic events in developing countries have been emphasized (WDR, 2014, Mobarak and Rosenzweig, 2012); see Carter et al. (2017) for a review). We add to this growing literature by highlighting novel channels about climatic risk management that allows us to understand how formal insurance and informal institutions interact.====The conventional view, as indicated in the above quote from the World Development Report (2014), is that informal networks affect demand for index insurance by providing insurance against basis risk. The mechanism outlined in our analysis indicates an additional channel where the presence of an informal network affects the risk attitudes of the individuals, and thus influences the demand for index insurance via (i) the provision of insurance against basis risk, but also (ii) make people more price sensitive. In practice, if this price sensitivity effect is stronger than the basis risk protection, then more subsidies might be needed in regions with higher risk-sharing arrangements and vice versa if we want to increase take-up.==== From a policy perspective, our results highlight how the combination of premium subsidies and informal networks might promote take-up and how this might eventually facilitate better protection against weather risks, particularly in vulnerable and low-income environments.","Risk, informal institutions, and index insurance",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069622000183,23 February 2022,2022,Research Article,87.0

We model the behavioral response to this climate amenity by pairing a unique panel of 12 million short-term property rental transactions with daily local weather, daily local snowpack, and daily local snowfall in every major ski resort market across the United States. Matching the spatial and temporal variation in the level of the amenity with that of related market transactions, we derive market-specific demand elasticities, explicitly accounting for substitution, to model recreation patterns throughout a typical season. Lastly, we combine downscaled projections of local snowpack under future climate scenarios to estimate within and across season trends in visitation during mid and late-century conditions. Our model predicts reductions in snow-related visitation of –40% to –60%, almost twice as large as previous estimates suggest. This translates to a lower-bound on the annual willingness to pay to avoid reductions in snowpack between $1.23 billion (RCP4.5) and $2.05 billion (RCP8.5) by the end of the century.","Winter recreation generates over $70 billion in economic activity each year across the United States (Outdoor Industry Association, 2017).==== Worldwide, there are 68 countries with operational ski resorts and established ski culture. Many rural mountain towns rely on snowpack to provide recreation opportunities that generate a significant portion of their local economic activity (Beaudin and Huang, 2014, White et al., 2016, Rosenberger et al., 2017, Burakowski et al., 2018), but climate change threatens these opportunities by reducing the supply of precipitation, increasing average temperatures, and shortening the length of the snow season (Feng and Hu, 2007, Burakowski et al., 2008, Burakowski and Magnusson, 2012, Dawson and Scott, 2013). These communities may, therefore, be particularly vulnerable to the reductions in precipitation and increases in average temperatures that are predicted by climate models. However, existing research has primarily focused on changes in the length of the ski season (extensive margin) to estimate changes in recreation behavior under different climate scenarios. Doing so implicitly makes the assumption that there is no behavioral response to marginal changes in the ==== during the season. We show that failing to account for changes in visitation throughout the season (intensive margin) may lead to substantial underestimation of the impacts of climate change on winter recreation. Moreover, efforts aimed at maintaining season length, such as artificial snow-making, do not fully address the underlying behavioral response to changes in mountain snowpack that are predicted by climate models.====To quantify potential changes in winter recreation under future climate scenarios, a researcher must first establish (or make assumptions about) a behavioral response that will map changes in snowpack to changes in resort visitation. Many existing studies have relied upon strong assumptions to generate this relationship, such as assuming that visitation is only a function of season length (Loomis and Crespi, 1999, Scott et al., 2007, Falk and Vanat, 2016, Rosenberger et al., 2017, Wobus et al., 2017). Damages, as measured by lost revenues, can then be mitigated by simply increasing investments in snow-making capacity to maintain minimum operating levels of snowpack at the resort. While this is a reasonable starting point, a known limitation is its ability to capture the behavioral response to marginal changes in resort snowpack that occur throughout the season (Falk, 2010, Gilaberte-Búrdalo et al., 2014, Damm et al., 2017, Scott et al., 2019, Steiger et al., 2019, Steiger and Scott, 2020). Other research has explored this limitation by looking at how skiers substitute across resorts in response to climate variability, concluding that geographical substitution can, in fact, help to bolster aggregate demand in the industry (Englin and Moeltner, 2004, Rutty et al., 2015a, Rutty et al., 2015b, Rutty et al., 2017, Steiger et al., 2020). We develop a method to estimate a damage function that accommodates substitution such that increases (decreases) in visitation are predicted on days with higher (lower) than average snowpack, providing a flexible damages curve that mirrors the true nature of recreation decisions.====Short-run changes in snowpack provide a key source of variation for identifying the relationship between recreation demand and snowpack as recreation decisions are often made in response to short-run fluctuations in weather conditions (Connolly, 2008, Dundas and von Haefen, 2019, Chan and Wichman, 2020). Unfortunately, market transactions that match the frequency of short-run shocks in mountain snowpack have been largely unavailable. Studies have instead used market data that is aggregated geographically (county or larger), temporally (monthly or larger), or both. Limited availability of high-frequency market transactions has also led prior work to quantify damages by comparing differences in visitation between high-snow and low-snow years (“inter-season”) (Steiger, 2011, Butsic et al., 2011, Burakowski et al., 2018). Such inter-season analyses are vulnerable to the confounding effects of other annual trends such as business cycles, fluctuations in macroeconomic growth, or local labor market conditions, all of which are correlated with weather patterns (Busse et al., 2015, Deryugina and Hsiang, 2017, Burakowski et al., 2018, Kahn et al., 2019).====We addresses this inconsistency in the resolution of available data by compiling a panel of high-frequency daily market transactions (individual short-term property rentals) together with daily snowpack and weather to estimate the effect of changes in mountain snowpack on visitation. We use daily resort-level visitation to isolate the demand response to marginal changes in snowpack from other confounding factors that influence demand and then draw comparisons to a more coarse monthly-level approach to illuminate the advantages of using daily data in this setting.====Several studies have also used within-season variation in visits and weather, but have been limited to a single season and only a few resorts (Morey, 1984, Englin and Moeltner, 2004).==== We find evidence of substantial heterogeneity in snowpack elasticities across states, limiting the external validity of estimates from any particular resort. Other work has used monthly counts of overnight stays and monthly averages of snowpack to estimate the behavioral response characterized as the elasticity of overnight stays (Falk, 2010).==== We model both daily and monthly decisions and test for differences between the resulting elasticities. In our setting, we find that elasticity estimates derived using monthly data are less precise and smaller than those derived using daily data, likely due to the inability of the monthly model to control for unobservable variation that is correlated with resort visitation.====We contribute to an emerging literature that uses short-run variation in climate amenities ==== the demand response to predict damages in the contemporary and under future climate scenarios (Chan and Wichman, 2020, Dundas and von Haefen, 2019). We make three primary contributions: (1) we develop a method to estimate elasticities for climate amenities by matching the spatial and temporal variation in the level of the amenity (daily snowpack) with the spatial and temporal variation of market responses to the amenity (daily transactions in the short-term property rental market); (2) we derive state-specific elasticity estimates for all states that have a large ski resort and show that significant heterogeneity exists across states; and (3) we estimate the within and across year variation in the contemporaneous value of snowpack and simulate local economic damages under two future warming scenarios, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5.==== We find that ski resorts could face annual reductions in local snow-related revenues of −40% to −60% (on average) by the end of the century (2080). When this response is applied to expenditures on lift-tickets and overnight stays, the estimated annual damages in each state range from $1 million (Connecticut) to $566 million (California).==== Across the U.S., partial annual damages total to between $1.64 billion (RCP4.5) and $2.36 billion (RCP8.5).",A market for snow: Modeling winter recreation patterns under current and future climate,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069622000195,21 February 2022,2022,Research Article,88.0

This is expected to result in wet areas getting wetter and dry areas getting drier. As water is key to life, ","The massive rise in the demand for blue water in the agricultural and industrial sector starting in the 1950s, together with continuous population growth, have amplified water scarcity in several parts of the world. Nowadays over-consumption of water is among the prime determinants of water scarcity (AghaKouchak et al., 2021). Global warming not only provokes the melting of ice resulting in an increase of sea level, but also raises evapotranspiration. As temperatures rise, the capacity of the atmosphere to hold water increases exponentially based on the Clausius–Clapeyron-relation. This leads to a redistribution of water from the earth into the atmosphere and to a rise in the frequency, duration, and intensity of extreme weather events (Huntington, 2006, Skliris et al., 2016). As a result, water crises are often listed among the largest global risks for the future (e.g., World Economic Forum, 2020).====The global prevalence of water-related conflicts and crises is already quite substantial, highlighting the conflict inducing potential of the competition over scarce resources as proposed by Homer-Dixon (1994) or Klare (2002). International disputes over the use of Nile water reappeared with the construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam between Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt in 2020. In India, numerous inter-state conflicts over state-crossing rivers have erupted in the past five decades (Richards and Singh, 2002, CNA, 2017). Violent clashes between herders and farmers in Nigeria resulted in more than 1300 deaths in 2018 and led to the displacement of thousands of people.==== In 2013, protests against the government arose in Senegal, when the capital was running out of water due to a damage in the water pipeline.====
      ====Beyond triggering conflict onset in its own right, water also plays a critical role in exacerbating already existing tensions. Longer periods without rainfall, combined with bad water management and rapid population growth, caused a surge in thirst- and hunger-related deaths in Yemen as around half of the population struggled to fulfill their basic daily water needs.==== The increase in grievance and inequality contributed to the onset of the civil war.==== Additionally, water stress is used as leverage in conflicts. During the ongoing Syrian civil war, violent extremist groups have captured major dams in order to increase pressure on the government and coerce the local population (CNA, 2017). These examples and many others suggest a causal link between water shortage and conflict.====Although empirical evidence on the direct link between water scarcity and conflict is limited, a substantial literature documents the effects of climatic shocks on violent conflict (Miguel et al., 2004, Ciccone, 2011, Hsiang et al., 2013, Burke et al., 2015, Harari and La Ferrara, 2018). Yet, no consensus has been reached (Scheffran et al., 2012, Theisen et al., 2013). Given the wide range of the consequences of climate change, the controversial findings are not surprising. From the various channels through which climate change may trigger conflict, our paper focuses on increases in the local scarcity of water, which is an essential resource for human existence.  Couttenier and Soubeyran (2014) use the Palmer drought index as a measure of exposure to water stress and find a weak positive link between droughts and civil war in Sub-Saharan Africa. Almer et al. (2017) show that droughts, measured by the standardized precipitation and evapotranspiration index (SPEI), lead to a higher likelihood of conflict in Sub-Saharan Africa using a grid cell-month panel. They conclude that droughts are especially conflict-increasing in cells with higher water demand (high agricultural activity) and low water supply.==== These studies provide important insights on the short-term effects of economic shocks arising out of relatively low rainfall, yet they disregard the spatial dependence, the human impact and global climatic factors influencing local water availability. Therefore, it is unclear in how far these estimates capture the effect of climate change on conflict.====We contribute to this literature by providing empirical evidence on the direct link between reductions in water availability and conflict, and by focusing on the climate-change-induced intensification of the water cycle. Using a novel dataset that measures total water mass changes (at the surface as well as underground) at the grid-cell level, we are able to track water mass changes arising not only from rainfall anomalies but also from faster water outflows via evapotranspiration, an overuse of water resources, groundwater droughts, and changes in run-off. By that, we follow the suggestion by AghaKouchak et al. (2021) to regard water scarcity as a process of natural and human-induced changes rather than a product resulting out of natural changes only and acknowledge the prevalence of water scarcity due to water over-consumption.====In this paper, we estimate the effect of a change in total available water mass within a grid-cell on the likelihood of local conflict. The simple correlation between water mass changes and conflict is likely to suffer from an omitted variable bias. For instance, local development dynamics – leading to economic and institutional change – can be expected to reduce the potential for conflict. At the same time, they can also lead to a quicker depletion of water reservoirs through intensifying water demand. This will lead to a negative correlation between water mass change and conflict, and bias the conflict inducing effects of water depletion downward. In order to establish a causal effect from reductions in available water on conflict, we instrument water mass change by the interaction of the number of drought months within each year derived from SPEI data (Croicu and Sundberg, 2015) with yearly changes in the average global temperature. Our IV strategy focuses on the intensification of the water cycle caused by climate change that alters water availability in space and time. Global warming leads to a faster evapotranspiration of water. This results in a loss of water into the atmosphere, and an increase in the intensity, duration and frequency of extreme weather events (Huntington, 2006, Skliris et al., 2016). Consequently, dry areas are expected to get even drier. Moreover, a drought of similar intensity can lead to larger losses of water mass on land. Our instrument captures this process. First, yearly average temperature changes account for the global effect of increased evapotranspiration on water loss on land. Second, we take the number of drought months within a year capturing the three most relevant aspects (duration, frequency, and intensity) of any particular extreme weather event at the local level. The combination of the two factors highlights that droughts will have stronger effects in warmer years as overall less water is available on land.====The instrumental variable approach rests on the assumption that the duration of a drought combined with global average temperature changes determines reductions in local water mass and affects conflict incidence only through the channel of water availability. As the water supply of a location is determined by groundwater storage, rainfall, runoff and underground water flows, rainfall anomalies are an excellent predictor of changes in water mass. Additionally, global temperature changes determine the overall loss of water mass into the atmosphere and ocean. We argue that after controlling for cell and country-year fixed effects and further geo-climatic controls that capture local anomalies in temperature and wind speed, the number of drought months interacted with average global temperature increase is exogenous to the likelihood of conflict. The geo-climatic controls help to exclude other channels of causation that may be correlated with localized drought occurrence, like excessive local temperatures that make people more violence-prone (Hsiang et al., 2013).====Our analysis combines satellite data on water mass movements at a 1.0 grid-cell level, provided by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission from US and German space agencies (NASA and DLR) (Wiese et al., 2018, Watkins et al., 2015, Landerer et al., 2020, Wiese et al., 2016) with geo-localized social conflict data from the Social Conflict Analysis Database (SCAD) (Salehyan et al., 2012). Changes in water mass are measured by deviations in the gravitation attraction of satellites circulating in Earth’s orbit. We focus on social conflict as we believe that water scarcity directly provokes social disputes, and elaborate on the combined effect of water scarcity with already existing tensions by analyzing the effects on distinct types of conflict. Our dataset is a cell-year panel that consists out of 2922 cells and covers Africa, Central America and the Caribbean, over the years 2002 to 2017.====
      ====Apart from providing an estimate of the direct effect of water mass declines on conflict, we also identify which locations are the most affected ones based on time-invariant demand factors (capturing the presence of irrigation, mining activities and urbanization) and supply-side characteristics such as surface water and access to groundwater. Hence, our paper also speaks to the literature investigating the mediator role of water supply characteristics in driving conflict (such as Döring 2020 and Sarsons 2015). We also complement the literature by expanding the geographical scope of previous studies to include besides Africa also Latin America and by elaborating on regional heterogeneities.====The results show that a one standard deviation larger drought-induced reduction in the water mass within a cell more than triples the local likelihood of social conflict, increasing it from a baseline of 2% by 4.3 percentage points. The effect is substantially smaller in locations with access to groundwater. By contrast, we find no evidence for stronger conflict inducing effects of water mass decline in locations with higher water demand potential. However, as to be expected, the instrument of increasing drought intensity is linked to larger reductions in the local water mass in places with a potentially larger water demand due to irrigation, mining, or urbanization. Changes in water mass respond not only to current droughts but also to past droughts, emphasizing that studies that do not account for temporal dependencies may underestimate the magnitude of the effect of droughts on conflict.",Water scarcity and social conflict,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069622000171,19 February 2022,2022,Research Article,89.0

The analysis links the cohort-level proficiency of primary school students born in the United States in the early 2000s to Toxics Release Inventory exposure, exploiting variation in the timing and magnitude of toxicity risk within public school catchment areas to estimate the impact of early exposure on educational outcomes. Estimates of airborne toxicity, which account for composition, may better correspond to human health risks from air pollution than total fine particulates. One ==== higher aggregate airborne toxicity in the catchment area during the year in which most students were born causes cohorts to perform 0.016 standard deviations worse on statewide tests. Finally, airborne chromium is identified as a driver of this effect: a ten percent change in ambient chromium concentrations during the first year of life causes a decrease in standardized test proficiency of 0.01 standard deviations.","Many environmental threats to fetal and infant health are well established. Increases in air pollution have negative consequences for contemporaneous and long-term health and cognition (Chay and Greenstone, 2003, Currie and Neidell, 2005, Currie and Schmieder, 2009, Agarwal et al., 2010, Currie et al., 2011, Currie et al., 2015, Sanders and Stoecker, 2015, Ebenstein et al., 2016, Knittel et al., 2016, Persico et al., 2016, Persico and Venator, 2019). The fetal origins hypothesis argues early childhood matters disproportionately for later life trajectory: conditions from conception to birth can have lasting consequences for health and cognition (Almond, 2006, Black et al., 2007, Royer, 2009). If exposure to air pollution during early stages of development affect long-run outcomes, protecting vulnerable populations from extreme pollution enables social mobility in addition to public health.====This paper is a national-scale, empirical examination of the effects on later-life cognitive performance from birth-year exposure to the many airborne chemicals in the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI). I ask whether variation in local toxicants in the early 2000s diminishes student performance on standardized tests taken nearly a decade later, from 2010 to 2015, by comparing the proficiency of cohorts of children passing through U.S. schools over six years. I pair TRI emissions with the U.S. Department of Education’s EDFacts, a national panel of school-level standardized test scores.====I aggregate pollution data to create a toxicity-weighted measure of the risk from TRI releases using the School Attendance Boundary Survey, a geospatial dataset of public school catchment areas. I also refine the findings by replacing the measure of aggregate toxicity with estimated concentrations of individual airborne metals. Identification of the effects of exposure to pollution on student standardized test proficiency relies on local, temporal variation in airborne chemical releases during the years in which successive cohorts of students were born.====Estimating the effect of pollution toxicity risk in the aggregate, I find one standard deviation higher airborne toxicity in a cohort’s typical year of birth causes 0.016 standard deviations lower proficiency on standardized tests in third grade. In this setting, among the metals and metal compounds reported in the TRI, exposure to chromium emissions in the first year of life appears to most affect subsequent test proficiency. This chemical-specific analysis does not rely on the EPA’s inhalation toxicity weights, but the importance of chromium corroborates the agency’s rankings.====This study contributes to an understanding of how the composition of air pollution matters for long-term cognitive outcomes. It is increasingly well-established that early exposure to airborne particulates has adverse long-run effects on outcomes like test scores and earnings (Sanders, 2012, Bharadwaj et al., 2017, Isen et al., 2017). However, measurements of the mass concentration of particulate matter (PM; either total suspended particulates, or when differentiated by particle size, PM2.5 and PM10) do not capture variation in its chemical composition. This fact motivates the current study, which is the first to link long-run cognitive outcomes to variation in the toxicity risk from, and specific constituents of, industrial pollution from many major sources. The findings also complement (Persico, 2020), which uses TRI-reporting plant openings and closings to find long-run harm to labor market outcomes from proximity to a facility.====That exposure to airborne toxic chemicals during vulnerable periods of development may drive lower educational performance nearly a decade earlier can inform the regulation of sources of toxic chemicals, and reinforce our understanding of the ways standardized testing outcomes reflect underlying environmental inequalities. The study of specific chemical releases calls attention to the importance of accounting for the composition of particulate matter, and the geographic breadth of the data, which cover a large majority of public elementary schools in the United States, make the findings immediately relevant to national education policy.",Toxic test scores: The impact of chemical releases on standardized test performance within U.S. schools,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069622000146,19 February 2022,2022,Research Article,91.0

Recognized worldwide as a major health hazard, acute exposure to ozone may cause damage to respiratory and cardiovascular health (Kim et al., 2011; Day et al., 2017), thus decreasing the labor productivity and welfare of outdoor workers.==== Despite mounting research on the productivity effects of particulate matter (PM; Chang et al., 2016; Archsmith et al., 2018; He et al., 2019), knowledge is not enough about the influence of ozone on outdoor labor productivity in developing countries, where most of the attention on air pollution control is focused on reductions in PM====.====Developing countries are being increasingly challenged to curb ozone pollution. Greenstone et al. (2021) find that since China declared a “war on pollution” in 2014 ozone concentrations have increased by 8.5%, although concentrations of PM====, PM====, SO====, NO====, and CO have sharply decreased. If ozone pollution is found to significantly decrease worker productivity, policy makers need to pay attention to vulnerable populations (e.g., couriers), enabling them to take precautionary measures, to help reduce the overall socioeconomic costs of air pollution. However, public awareness of ozone pollution is low, and ozone warnings have only recently been implemented, even in regions with the most severe ozone pollution, such as the ==== (====) region in China.====We investigate the contemporaneous and cumulative effects of ozone pollution on outdoor workers using a unique panel dataset on the daily productivity of couriers from a top-five express delivery company in China. Estimating the productivity effects of ozone pollution is impeded by a paucity of productivity data of the vulnerable population (i.e., workers in the outdoor environment) as well as the coexistence of multiple pollutants. High-quality records of daily delivery volumes at the courier level are used to determine employee salaries, providing an opportune dataset for examining the effects of ozone pollution on the productivity of outdoor workers. In addition, our dataset covers 18 cities in Guangdong province that have long been notorious for ozone pollution in summer.====Measurement errors in the pollution variable may bias the estimated effect of ozone pollution on labor productivity downward. This can be exacerbated in a fixed effects (FE) model. Additionally, omitted variables often arise in research that estimates the socioeconomic effects of air pollution (Arceo et al., 2016). Nevertheless, avoidance behavior by couriers in China is limited due to their typical outdoor working environments, which are not equipped with air purifiers or air conditioners; the invisibility of ozone pollution; and low awareness of effective protective measures to prevent ozone inhalation (to be explained in Section 2).====Based on scientific evidence that long-range transport of ozone and its precursors may occur over several hundred kilometers (Kato et al., 2004; Gao et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2019), we construct an instrumental variable (IV) for local ozone pollution to correct the biases from omitted variables and measurement errors by using ozone concentrations of nearby upwind cities. The IV estimation results show that a 1 standard deviation (1-SD) increase in daily ozone pollution significantly decreases daily courier productivity by 6.8%, conditional on individual FE, month FE, day-of-week FE, and various weather characteristics. As a comparison, the OLS estimate is 1.7%. Using the aforementioned method, we also construct an IV for PM==== and PM==== and simultaneously estimate the effects of ozone and PM==== and PM====, respectively (to be explained in Section 5.2.5). These specifications also yield highly significant negative effects of ozone on courier productivity. In addition, in a single-pollutant IV regression, we find significant harmful effects of PM==== on courier productivity. The IV estimated contemporaneous effect of ozone is consistent across specifications including controls for possible regional economic activity shocks, alternative forms of weather characteristics, controls for other pollutant concentrations, and finer seasonal variation in ozone. The effect is robust in models that vary the construction method of the IV or which account for short-run productivity displacement. Couriers are required to work under a routine schedule, and we find that ozone pollution does not significantly affect worker attendance, which suggests that the negative effect of ozone pollution results mostly from productivity changes at the intensive margin. Moreover, IV estimates from a distributed lag model reveal that a 1-SD increase in ozone over the previous 30 days significantly decreases courier productivity by 23.7%. The magnitude is consistent with the literature on the morbidity effects of ozone pollution (Burnett et al., 2001; Lleras-Muney, 2010).====This study contributes to the existing literature in three ways. First, it is among the first to investigate the causal effects of ozone pollution on worker productivity in highly polluted, fast-growing areas, using high-frequency individual productivity data from real working environments. Despite the literature on the productivity effects of PM (Adhvaryu et al., 2019; Archsmith et al., 2018; Chang et al., 2019a; He et al., 2019; Heyes et al., 2019), the biological and medical mechanisms of how PM and ozone can impair human health may still differ. Mullins (2018) find that decreases in ozone concentrations improve the performance of athletes in intercollegiate track and field competitions in the United States. This paper is closest to that of Graff Zivin and Neidell (2012), which finds that decreases in ozone concentrations increase productivity of agricultural workers in the United States. We study the same pollution mechanism — ozone pollution on labor productivity — but focus on a different type of outdoor work (couriers versus agricultural harvesters) in a different country (China versus the United States). Graff Zivin and Neidell (2012) rely on an OLS model that omits individual FE in their main specification, whereas we exploit an IV approach using wind-transported ozone pollution while controlling for individual FE for identification. We find that a 10 μg/m==== decrease in daily ozone pollution (sample mean = 101.5 μg/m====) significantly increases daily courier productivity by 1.4%. This finding is close to that of Graff Zivin and Neidell (2012), that is, a decrease of 10 parts per billion (ppb) (19.6 μg/m====) in 9-h ozone concentrations (sample mean = 95.5 μg/m====) increases worker productivity by 5.5%.==== However, estimates obtained in the context of developed countries may not be simply extrapolated to developing countries because of differences in institutional and socioeconomic backgrounds between developed and developing countries, such as the levels of health care (Arceo et al., 2016). Also, we know little about the extent to which co-pollutants may influence the productivity effect of ozone pollution. The average concentrations of PM==== and PM==== in this study are 27.2 and 45.1 μg/m====, respectively, which, according to studies in the context of developed countries (e.g., Chang et al., 2019a), may affect labor productivity.==== The average concentration of PM==== in Graff Zivin and Neidell (2012) is 11.7 μg/m====. Comparing the contemporaneous effect of ozone in this study with that found by Graff Zivin and Neidell (2012) suggests that ozone pollution decreases labor productivity by similar magnitudes even when PM==== and PM==== are at higher levels that may produce larger negative effects.====Second, although medical studies suggest that long-term exposure to ozone may increase the risk of death from respiratory causes, evidence of the causal relationship between long-term ozone exposure and many health outcomes is insufficient (US EPA, 2020). Some economic studies estimate the cumulative or long-term effects of PM on labor productivity in the manufacturing sector (Hansen-Lewis, 2018; He et al., 2019; Fu et al., 2021). To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to use a causal inference framework to estimate the cumulative effects of ozone pollution on worker productivity in the service sector. Graff Zivin and Neidell (2012) examine the cumulative effects of ozone by adding one and two lags of daily ozone pollution, respectively, using an OLS model, and conclude that the predominant effect of ozone is from same-day exposure. However, our IV estimates indicate that, even on a time scale of one month, relying only on the contemporaneous effect can underestimate the productivity loss from ozone pollution.====Third, this study focuses on the rapidly developing express delivery industry, which is an important component of the service sectors and national economies of developed and developing countries. Around the world, last-mile delivery is becoming increasingly critical as the demand for high-end, time-sensitive, goods increases. From 2015 to 2020, global consumer spending on delivery services had an average annual growth rate of 6.1%.==== In 2019, the express delivery industry in China delivered over 63.5 billion items (more than any other country), hired more than 3 million employees, and earned 108 billion USD in revenues (State Post Bureau of China, 2019). In recent years there has been a shortage of couriers in China.==== Our calculations show that, in 2019, ozone pollution reduced the incomes of express delivery couriers in China by more than 3 billion USD. Given the growing economic importance of the express delivery industry and e-commerce, which has been magnified in the post–COVID-19 era, this study suggests that ignoring ozone pollution controls can significantly decrease labor productivity and the incomes of couriers in many countries, which, in the long term, may impede the development of the whole industry.====Existing related research on the service sectors in developing countries focuses on workers in indoor environments (Chang et al., 2019b; Huang et al., 2020; Kahn and Li, 2020). Similar studies are needed for the many groups of outdoor workers worldwide. For instance, 37.2% and 81.4% of people in urban and rural areas of China, respectively, still work outdoors or in non-climate-controlled environments (China Labor-force Dynamics Survey, 2016). In outdoor working environments, which are not equipped with air purifiers, workers are especially susceptible to ozone pollution. The need for physical strength and mental skill makes the job of a courier similar to many other outdoor jobs, such as food delivery, outdoor maintenance, and agricultural work.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the background of the courier job and ozone pollution in China and explains in detail why our dataset in Guangdong province offers a useful setting for analyzing the productivity effects of ozone pollution. Section 3 provides the data and summary statistics. Section 4 describes the empirical models. Section 5 discusses the estimation results, which are compared with the existing literature, and presents the welfare effects of ozone pollution. Section 6 concludes.",Productivity loss amid invisible pollution,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069622000201,18 February 2022,2022,Research Article,92.0

Over the past several years, experimental games have been applied increasingly in transdisciplinary research in natural resource management with a strong purpose to develop capacity to promote learning and behavioral change. Yet, few studies have evaluated the potential of different experimental game designs to promote collective action outside of experiments. In a framed field experiment on water management in rural India, we compared within-game behavior and collective action outside the game between individuals who received individual payments and those who did not. Our results show little evidence for different behavior in the game. However, we find some evidence that our experimental game induced real-world changes compared to a control group without game intervention and that this change is slightly more likely to occur when individual payments are used.","Experimental games acquired their name from game theory and the field of experimental economics to determine general principles of behavior in strategic interactions. One prominent example are social dilemma games that offer players a structured way to experience and reflect on the problem of free-riding and cooperation. They can help understand the need for communication or institutional regimes to alleviate free-riding incentives. Games are considered increasingly to be learning tools to develop problem-solving capacities by providing players with useful metaphors for their daily lives (Cárdenas and Carpenter, 2008, Gomes et al., 2018, Meinzen-Dick et al., 2018, Rodela et al., 2019). To accommodate low levels of formal education, the games are framed according to the underlying decision context to be less abstract and appear more realistic for players who face concrete resource dilemmas in their daily lives. Over the past several years, an increasing number of games has been applied with a strong capacity development purpose and addresses the use of games as an intervention tool in natural resource and environmental governance (Ducrot et al., 2015; Becu et al., 2017; Speelman et al., 2017; Ferrero et al., 2018; Meinzen-Dick et al., 2018; Redpath et al., 2018).==== In some way, these framed experimental games carried out in the field have moved closer to what is commonly referred to as a game, as they are potentially challenging, entertaining, and instructive for participants.====However, embedding games into transdisciplinary and participatory development processes has revealed potential trade-offs between design features that support learning and those that support data validity. For example, one particularity in economic experiments is that they rely on monetary incentives, as described in the induced value theory (Smith, 1976).==== Incentive compatibility is created by linking remuneration to choices or outcomes. As a result, respondents are thought to ponder their choices more carefully (Mørkbak et al., 2014). However, NGOs and other development agents are reluctant to distribute unequal monetary rewards when participants should develop a feeling of ownership in the process. There is fear of tensions in communities when only those who participated are “rewarded” or some players receive greater rewards than others. Further, concerns have been raised that the willingness to participate in unpaid research and development activities is reduced once participants have been rewarded. Hur and Nordgren (2016) found that performance incentives increased the desire for a reward by activating the concept of making money and raised concerns that such practices may increase unethical behavior.====This study contributes to the debate on the use of monetary incentives at the interface of research and development work. We compare the effect of playing games without individual payments with playing games with individual payments based on game earnings. This is consistent with the induced value theory. Playing games without making such payments is consistent with common development practices. On the one hand, we are interested in individual payments' effect on behavior in the experiment, as Meinzen-Dick et al. (2018) investigated. On the other hand, as a novel procedure, we associate our experimental data with survey data that were collected just before and nearly two years after the game in 60 treated and 30 control communities. Based upon these survey data, we can study the game intervention's impact on potential real-life behavioral changes. These insights can support future transdisciplinary collaborations and help make intervention design choices more evidence-based.====We study the effect of monetary incentives by integrating an irrigation game into development interventions to improve the water management in Madhya Pradesh in India. Communities in the research area face water shortages regularly, particularly in the post-rainy season, and ease water limitations using community-managed rainwater harvesting structures. Another response is the cultivation of water-efficient crops, which allows the cultivated area to be expanded and water to be distributed more equally in the community. Both management practices have inherent potential social dilemmas, which may be one reason that water harvesting structures (referred to below as dams) are maintained poorly and most farmers favor crops that require large amounts of water (Falk et al., 2020). The game intervention was intended to motivate changes in both types of behavior.====Game players were farmers who rely on irrigation water for their livelihood. The games were carried out in 60 villages. In half of the villages, players received performance-based individual payments (IP). The other half received no individual payments. Instead, the village received a lump-sum payment to be used for any community purposes (CP). To assess the long-term behavioral change, we carried out two survey waves on water management-related collective actions within the 60 treated villages, as well as 30 control villages. The first survey was conducted immediately before the irrigation game in 2017, while the second was conducted nearly two years later. This allows us to investigate - differentiated by payment scheme - the experimental games’ effects on behavioral change related to dam maintenance in IP and CP villages compared to control villages that received no intervention. We hypothesized that IPs are more likely to reveal the true preferences of farmers in the game. In addition, IPs may increase engagement in the game, which could intensify the learning effect, and then might relate to behavioral change after the game.====Similar to Meinzen-Dick et al. (2018), we find that the variation in payments yielded few differences in game outcomes. However, we find some evidence that our experimental game induced real-world changes and that this change is slightly more likely to occur when IPs are used. We further explore whether game dynamics, such as communication within and after the game, may translate into a change in maintenance behavior.",Experimental games in transdisciplinary research: The potential importance of individual payments,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009506962200016X,17 February 2022,2022,Research Article,93.0

The scheme incorporates two allowance reserves that adjust the supply of allowances in the event of unexpectedly high or low allowance demand. These reserves are enacted if the clearing price breaches a predetermined set of trigger prices. Our experiment finds trigger prices act as focal points: the distribution of clearing prices is bimodal and aligns with the trigger prices. We find the existence of focal points can be explained by both the institutional design and subjects’ behavior. Further, decreasing the range between trigger prices increases total revenue but decreases allocative efficiency. The regulation is more sensitive to changes in trigger prices than reserve quantities.","A common feature within existing pollution markets is the ability of a regulator to adjust allowance supply. These supply policies are typically incorporated within the initial allocation mechanism of each market: usually, pollution auction rules are adjusted so that the allowance supply can vary in the face of unexpected allowance demand. An increase in supply may assist in reducing firms’ abatement costs whereas a reduction in supply may incentivize innovation in pollution abatement. Such adjustable allowance policies are used in the US Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU-ETS), and the California Cap-and-trade Program (Shobe et al., 2014, Perino and Willner, 2016, Burtraw et al., 2018).====In this article we investigate one prominent design that has recently been adopted by the US Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI): the use of dual ==== “Qs” and ==== “Ps”. An allowance reserve is a separate quantity of allowances that can be used to adjust the initial supply either up or down (Murray et al., 2009, Burtraw et al., 2018). Consequently, a reserve will be used to increase supply when the initial allowance price is sufficiently high: the initial price has to be larger than a ‘trigger’ price, which has been predetermined by the regulator. An allowance reserve can also be used to reduce supply, which works in a similar but opposite manner: if the initial allowance price is too low – below a set trigger price – the reserve will withdraw allowances from the supply.==== We find that the regulator’s choice of “Ps and Qs” has a pivotal effect on the regulatory outcome. In particular, we find the regulator’s choice of trigger prices “Ps” act as focal points for the firms, which determines the allowance clearing price and thus influences revenue generation and allocative efficiency.====The actual RGGI design, which commenced at the beginning of 2021, has been developed to not only contain firms’ costs (by maintaining a pre-existing upper allowance reserve) but also to contain emissions (by introducing a lower allowance reserve). This is observed within Fig. 1.====RGGI’s initial allowance supply is projected to be around 13–15 million allowances per auction (where each allowance accounts for one ton of ====).==== The upper reserve denoted by the Cost Containment Reserve (CCR) holds a stock of 7,514,778 allowances that can be released to the auction if the initial clearing price is higher than the trigger price of $13 per allowance. The lower reserve – denoted by the Emissions Containment Reserve (ECR) – has a capacity of 6,845,333 allowances that can be withdrawn from the market if the initial clearing price is below $6 per allowance. Although this novel regulatory design commenced in 2021, it is ==== unclear how the design of multiple allowance reserves – with corresponding trigger prices – will affect the functioning of the auction and the regulatory scheme in general. In particular, it is unknown how the interaction and combination of these two allowance reserves will affect the clearing prices, revenue, and efficiency. This is important to study given the economic and the environmental impacts of these regulatory features. Our paper is a first step in this direction.====In this article, we develop an experimental analysis of variable allowance supply, which underpins the core institutional design of RGGI. In our stylized framework, we examine how the design of both an upper and lower allowance reserve (with associated trigger prices) alters the auction outcome. Our aim within this article, then, is to investigate how the regulator’s design choices – of trigger prices, initial supply, and allowance reserves – impact the auction outcome. We find evidence that the regulator’s chosen trigger prices act as focal points: the distribution of clearing prices is bimodal, which aligns with the trigger prices. We show that this is not just an institutional design feature of having two allowance reserves but is exacerbated by buyers’ bidding strategies. Furthermore, the equilibrium clearing prices are positively related to independent changes in both trigger prices.====We also find the range between the two trigger prices – what we denote as the ==== – has significant implications for the outcome of the scheme. As the width of the trigger-price collar decreases, i.e., the “soft” price floor and ceiling move closer together, we find this increases total revenue and the amount of allowances sold, but decreases allocative efficiency. Throughout our analysis, we find the scheme is more sensitive to changes in trigger prices than changes in quantities. Holding the maximum number of allowances constant, we find evidence that increases in the initial cap (with a smaller CCR and constant ECR) decreases the final clearing price as well as increasing the number of equilibrium allowances sold. However, we find that changes in quantities have ==== on revenue or allocative efficiency.====As our evidence highlights the focal-point characteristics of the regulator’s trigger prices, we complement the prominent literature that investigates the so-called ==== (e.g., Isaac and Plott, 1981, Coursey and Smith, 1983, Scherer and Ross, 1990, Knittel and Stango, 2003, Gode and Sunder, 2004, Engelmann and Müller, 2011, Rey and Tirole, 2019). This hypothesis argues non-binding price controls – usually “hard” price ceilings – may create a focal point in pricing decisions and thereby reduce competition. Although empirical evidence does exist for focal points in a limited number of markets (e.g., Knittel and Stango, 2003), the experimental laboratory evidence generally finds no collusive focal-point effects (Isaac and Plott, 1981, Coursey and Smith, 1983, Engelmann and Müller, 2011). In contrast to this literature, we find evidence of focal-point effects within a trigger-price system. This strengthens the argument for the existence of focal points. In addition, it widens the support for the focal-point hypothesis from traditional non-binding “hard” price ceilings as observed in the literature to “soft” price floors and ceilings (where the clearing price can be above or below the predetermined trigger prices). We show that these focal-point effects arise from both the institutional design ==== from bidding strategies in the auction.====Our main innovation centers on the analysis of ==== allowance reserves, which has not been explored by researchers thus far. In doing so, we are able to analyze how the regulator’s institutional design parameters – both separately and in combination – affect the operation of the regulatory scheme. More generally, our research also advances the literature on pollution market supply-side policies. The original idea of combining both prices and quantities to regulate can be traced back to Roberts and Spence (1976) and Weitzman (1978).==== Since then a broad literature has developed to investigate how alternative supply-side polices perform with respect to cost effectiveness. In particular, Murray et al. (2009) provide arguments for the use of allowance reserves and a number of studies have consequently investigated how a ==== allowance reserve – to ensure cost containment – would perform (Burtraw et al., 2010, Fell and Morgenstern, 2010, Grüll and Taschini, 2011, Fell et al., 2012, Shobe et al., 2014, Stranlund et al., 2014, Kollenberg and Taschini, 2016, Khezr and MacKenzie, 2018, Salant et al., 2019). Overall, this literature tends to find that adjusting allowance supply assists in cost containment and can improve welfare.==== Yet in our analysis, with ==== allowance reserves, we find this may not always hold: the focal-point effects could mean that firms’ costs increase if the regulator decides to raise ==== of the trigger prices.====In terms of methodologies, the majority of this literature uses either theoretical or simulation modeling. For example, in relation to California’s cap-and-trade market, Borenstein et al. (2019) show, using simulations, that the distribution of clearing prices may be skewed towards either the price floor or the ceiling due to high levels of uncertainty of the business-as-usual emissions as well as the relative price-inelasticity of pollution abatement. Hence equilibrium prices are likely to be concentrated at trigger prices. This study provides useful insight as to the workings of emission markets and in particular the California program and suggests that trigger prices can potentially become focal points. It may be hard, however, to use this to infer policy implications for RGGI because the new features of the dual allowance reserve system – and the corresponding distinct incentive effects – are unique to RGGI. Our goal therefore is to examine the use of dual allowance reserves and trigger prices as adopted by RGGI. In contrast to Borenstein et al. (2019), our approach focuses on examining the behavioral response to these design features, using experimental methods. Behavioral reactions to market design features can be difficult to capture using simulations. Further, investigating the behavior of bidders using observational data can be extremely challenging, as individual bidding behavior and actions are private information, as are valuations, and the counterfactual is not known, which makes it hard to obtain a meaningful comparison.====Consequently, there is a branch of literature that focuses on the experimental evidence of supply-side policies.==== The major benefit is that this can provide evidence of agent behavior within a controlled environment with known valuations in order to test the impacts of regulatory design (Shobe et al., 2010, Shobe et al., 2014, Holt and Shobe, 2016, Perkis et al., 2016, Burtraw et al., 2018). To date, however, the analysis of ==== allowance reserves has been neglected. Although Burtraw et al. (2018) focus on analyzing three ECR treatments relative to a no-ECR policy, they do not provide an investigation of the ECR in combination with a CCR nor the ramifications of the regulator’s institutional design parameters. Further, Stranlund et al. (2014) consider price controls and banking within an allowance market but their price controls are “hard” price floors and ceilings, which allow unlimited changes within allowance supply.====Our contribution is therefore in providing a greater understanding of the role and ramifications of dual allowance reserve policies and the associated focal points that are created. We find that the regulator’s predetermined choice of initial allowance supply, trigger prices, and allowance reserves, have important implications for the functioning of the regulatory scheme. Our evidence suggests the price of carbon can be heavily influenced by the regulator’s choice of trigger prices rather than the cost of pollution control (which may have long-run efficiency impacts). The findings from this study will provide further knowledge for the designers of prominent allowance markets.====Our article is organized as follows. In Section 1.1, we provide a background on the institutional design within RGGI. In Section 2 we outline the experimental design.

The value of transmission expansion varies based upon how new renewable investment over the sample is attributed to transmission expansion: payback periods range from roughly 40 years (assuming no investment impact) to roughly 20 years (assuming observed capacity increases are due to transmission expansion). Payback periods also depend on how global pollutants like carbon and regional pollutants like PM 2.5 are internalized by regional policy makers, reducing the payback period further to as little as 11 years.","Because electricity storage technologies are still immature and costly, electricity produced at one location must be moved via transmission lines to locations where it is immediately consumed. If there is insufficient transmission capacity, there can be congestion constraints leading to price discrepancies in the wholesale price of electricity over space (Joskow and Tirole, 2005, Davis and Hausman, 2016). Popular press has reported how increases in wind generation capacity are straining the grid and advocates argue that wind farms require more transmission to fully benefit investors, ratepayers, and federal taxpayers subsidizing pollutant free wind.====There is reason to believe that transmission line construction cannot be provided efficiently by the market due to their nature of natural monopolies (Joskow and Tirole, 2005): they have high fixed costs and low marginal costs similar to telephone lines. As a result, regional electricity entities like Independent System Operators (ISOs) often plan and facilitate their construction passing the cost on to market participants.====Regional electricity entities that plan transmission construction must respond to federal energy policies thereby creating a regulatory federalism issue. One sharp example is the federal Production Tax Credit (PTC) designed to spur investment in wind generation. The PTC is a large volumetric based subsidy whereby each Megawatt Hour (MWh) of electricity produced entitles the renewable asset owner to a deductible federal tax credit, regardless of the location and wholesale price of the electricity generated. Windfarm investors have used the PTC extensively to increase the profitability of windfarms: federal payments of the PTC in 2015 were roughly $4.4 billion.====The interaction between large increases in wind generation and a transmission grid built before wind capacity build-out is likely very important because wind patterns are spatially concentrated. For example, in the U.S. wind capacity is the greatest in the mostly rural plains far away from urban demand centers. However, the U.S. federal government’s PTC did not include a complementary federal policy which explicitly optimized the electricity transmission grid in response to new wind capacity. As a result, the federal government relied on regional grid transmission planners to appropriately plan and invest in transmission capacity to complement isolated and spatially clustered new windfarms. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) order number 1000, issued in 2016, implicitly acknowledges this challenge and requires that impacted utilities and other regional stakeholders “must consider transmission needs driven by public policy requirements established by state or federal laws or regulations”.====We present evidence in this paper that in order to understand the welfare and incidence of federal electricity policies, it is vital to also understand the transmission implications of those policies. Specifically, we estimate the economic benefits of building new large-scale transmission capacity conditional on large increases in wind capacity. To do so, we combine a new theoretical model and structural research design. In the theoretical model, we extend the electricity transmission constraint framework in Joskow and Tirole (2005) to wind generation. The Joskow and Tirole (2005) model considers a simple transmission system with two nodes: one with excess demand (net demand) which serves as an importer, and the other with excess supply (net supply) which serves as an exporter. Unconstrained transmission capacity allows trade between the two nodes until nodal prices are equal. Deviations from a single network price imply congestion in the model. In a straightforward extension, we add intermittent renewable generation to the model and show how the shadow cost of any transmission constraint changes with increased intermittent renewable generation. We also show how increases in transmission capacity decrease price differences between exporting and importing regions when renewables generate.====In the empirical section, we use quasi-experimental variation in the construction of a large ====$7 billion transmission expansion in ERCOT (Texas’ electricity grid) to estimate economic benefits of the expansion. The expansion was called the Competitive Renewable Energy Zones (CREZ) project and added significant transmission capacity between wind generation locations in west Texas and load centers in the north, south, and southeastern Texas. Internal ERCOT reports and documents show explicitly that ERCOT planners were thinking about the CREZ expansion as a two-node problem with west ERCOT being the renewable generation node and the rest of ERCOT being the demand centers.==== Others have noted similar issues in CAISO (Casey et al., 2007). This is similar to many other renewable generation sites like MISO wind generation (concentrated in sparsely populated Iowa and transmitted to Chicago) and solar farms in sparsely populated desert locations. CREZ construction occurred mainly between 2011 and 2014. We use hourly wind generation, hourly wholesale price data, and hourly load data from 2011–2016 to estimate how wind generation impacts price discrepancies (e.g., through shifts in the net demand and net supply curves) across space as more CREZ lines are completed.====The key empirical feature in our approach is that we directly estimate the slopes of the net supply and net demand curves in ERCOT and combine them with the theoretical model of congestion and wind generation. The parameters combined with the structure in the theoretical model allow us to construct congestion costs for each hour in our data and compare them to a counterfactual in which wind generation would be traded freely until prices between generation centers in west ERCOT and load centers in the north ERCOT, south ERCOT and southeastern ERCOT (e.g., Houston) are equal.==== We leverage the unique spatial distribution of wind and load centers and regulatory history in ERCOT to combine the theoretical and empirical models to perform the analysis in addition to robustness checks.====Our approach is more transparent and parsimonious than a research design which uses an engineering simulation of the ERCOT market. A simulation research design focusing on CREZ and wind generation would need to simulate the entire ERCOT transmission network, the market behavior of each market participant and the algorithm used to allocate production as a function of bids and load. While a simulation based approach might capture some complexities like network loop flows, we provide evidence that our more parsimonious approach is sufficient for evaluating first order impacts of new transmission construction. Also, we purposely do not use ERCOT bidding data because our goal is to have an approach which can scale to other markets where offer curve data is not available.====Consistent with transmission constraints preventing trade, our results show a price gap of ====$5/MWh in 2011 before much of CREZ was completed and a ====$0.50/MWh price gap in 2015 after CREZ was mostly finished. Leveraging the theoretical model’s structure, we calculate that annual wholesale electricity market benefits from CREZ conditional on extant wind generation before CREZ began is roughly $170M/year due to reduced transmission constraint loss from increased trade. We also measure benefits from CREZ assuming that all increased capacity over the sample would have occurred even in the absence of CREZ in which case transmission constraint losses increase to $330M/year. The $170M/year estimate eliminates any potential endogeneity in wind investment and is a lower bound whereas the $330M/year estimate is an upper bound. Hence, we find that accounting for investment impacts of transmission expansions on renewables is material for measuring gains.====Since electricity production has unpriced negative externalities (CO2 and other air pollutants), we perform a back-of-the-envelope calculation for benefits of mitigated fossil fuel generation from increased trade of wind electricity. If 10% of generation from wind was curtailed in this period due to transmission capacity constraints, the non-market impacts of CO2 alone using a price per ton estimate of $37 (in 2007 dollars) are roughly $125M/year.==== That number ignores other unpriced pollutants like PM 2.5, making it a lower bound. Non-market benefits due to production reshuffling from increased trade of roughly $200M/year from Fell et al. (2021) implies annual non-market benefits of roughly $325M/year. In sum, we estimate annual benefits of CREZ conditional on installed wind capacity at a lower bound of roughly $370M/year (short run, no curtailment) to $655M/year (long run, 10% curtailment) over our sample.==== Recalling the project was $7 billion, we estimate a payback period between roughly 11 and 19 years accounting for non-market externalities.====There are asymmetries in the incidence of CREZ. Our net supply and net demand parameters imply that west ERCOT ratepayers saw their wholesale electricity prices increase while ratepayers in the rest of ERCOT saw their rates decrease modestly. Similarly, generators in west ERCOT received higher wholesale prices while generators in the rest of ERCOT earned modestly lower wholesale prices. In ERCOT wind blows at night, implying that baseload generators took the brunt of CREZ’s price decreases outside of the West. For example, in late 2017 ERCOT approved the decommissioning of ====4,000 MWh of coal fired generation. While it is beyond the scope of this paper to make causal statements about retirement decisions, the decision to retire those plants was certainly not helped by CREZ since it lowered wholesale prices where the coal fired plants were located. Importantly, these incidence measures are transfers from one set of stakeholders to another so they do not factor in our cost–benefit analysis.====In addition to payback periods, transmission costs also matter for assessing the incidence of benefits and costs of the renewable policy more broadly. We focus on measuring the payback period for transmission lines conditional on wind investment having already overextended the existing transmission grid. However, the PTC, which almost certainly led to incremental windfarm development, cost U.S. taxpayers $4.4 billion in 2015 alone. Transmission investment, which we find matters for regional welfare and incidence, is born by regional authorities. Our findings are consistent with a regulatory federalism issue that federal policy leads to changes in optimal regional policy.====The policy implications of this paper speak directly to the policy debate playing out in the popular press on transmission line construction. Our estimates indicate that the benefits of additional transmission in ERCOT has a payback period of roughly 21–41 years when not accounting for pollution and carbon. The payback period drops to 11–19 years when valuing pollution and carbon mitigation. Insofar as these ERCOT results are externally valid, the social gains from additional transmission ride very much on how CO2 and air pollution reductions are valued by ISOs. At a high level, the key metric for external validity is the spatial correlation of renewable generation and load. The results are likely to hold in Iowa where generation is relatively large compared to load. In California, roof top solar has tighter spatial correlation with demand meaning that transmission capacity might be less important. Finally, we do not address any potential benefits from increased security of the transmission grid due to additional transmission capacity, hence benefits could be modestly larger accounting for those benefits.====This paper adds to a growing literature on renewable energy policy in the U.S. There is a large literature on environmental impacts or possible environmental impacts of wind generation (Cullen, 2013, Novan, 2015, Holladay and LaRiviere, 2017). Our work focuses on a different question: market inefficiencies brought about by policies aimed at increasing renewable generation. As a result, our work is more in line with how renewables have impacted or can interact with various market conditions (Callaway et al., 2018, Gowrisankaran et al., 2016, Cullen and Reynolds, 2017). While not investigating investment dynamics empirically like Cullen and Reynolds (2017) and focusing on transmission expansion’s impact on extant capacity, we do discuss the implications of transmission expansion on investment decisions. The only other economics paper to study CREZ we are aware of is Fell et al. (2021) which identifies how wind generation substitutes for different types of fossil fuel generation in the rest of ERCOT before, during and after CREZ’s construction and focuses on non-market implications of CREZ.====Our contribution, however, is primarily on transmission constraints and the economics of the electricity sector and the challenges of layered national and regional energy policy. In terms of net supply and net demand, Borenstein et al. (2002) focuses on imported electricity into California to evaluate the relative efficiency of California’s restructured electricity markets. The closest papers to ours include Davis and Hausman (2016) which addresses the impacts of changes in transmission constraints, among other market outcomes, due to a nuclear plant shutdown. Wolak (2015) and Ryan (2021) directly discuss and estimate economic benefits of transmission investment in Canada and India respectively and find economically significant benefits of transmission enabled wholesale market competition. Our work follows these papers in addressing the benefits of market integration in electricity markets and trade supporting investments generally but focused on renewables specifically.====More broadly, there is a large literature on how deregulation and market power impacts strategic bidding behavior of market participants (Puller, 2007, Bushnell et al., 2008, Mansur, 2008, Fowlie, 2009, Ito and Reguant, 2016, Mercadal, 2018). Further, ERCOT in particular has received attention related to strategic bidding behavior and efficiency (Hortacsu and Puller, 2008, Hortacsu et al., 2017) and shows that market participants leverage market power in ERCOT. Our research design does not allow us to disentangle welfare gains from increased transmission capacity attributable to increased trade directly (e.g., selling wind into higher priced regions) versus indirectly from decreased market power of market participants (e.g., fossil fuel generators strategically bidding in electricity at lower prices due to increased competition from renewables). Both effects of increased transmission capacity work in the same direction however so that our approach still allows us to aggregate measure welfare and incidence impacts. We do discuss implications of market power in detail and also perform robustness checks by trimming our sample to periods where market power is the least likely to occur, but we do not disentangle the relative impact of increased trade versus reductions in market power from increased trade.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the theoretical model framework. Section 3 introduces basic background about the CREZ project. Section 4 presents datasets used in this paper. Section 5 conducts reduced form analysis of the CREZ impacts. Section 6 calculates transmission constraint loss associated with wind generation and discusses incidence of the CREZ project.

We find both groups respond similarly (in percentage terms) to moderate temperatures, but low-income households’ energy spending is half as responsive to extreme temperatures. Consistent with low-income households cutting back on necessities to afford their energy bills, we find similar disparities in the food spending response to extreme temperature. These results suggest adaptation to extreme weather, such as air conditioning use, is prohibitively costly for households experiencing ====.","Many U.S. households report struggling to pay their energy bills. Eleven percent of households kept their home at an unhealthy or unsafe temperature for at least one month in 2015, and over 20 percent reduced or went without basic necessities to pay a home energy bill (Energy Information Administration, 2018). These households are disproportionately low income (Energy Information Administration, 2018), as are households that are ====, spending more than 10 percent of household income on energy services (Jessel et al., 2019). These hardships exist despite energy assistance and other social programs.====Climate change makes understanding energy costs for households experiencing poverty urgent. Air conditioning dramatically reduces the effects of heat exposure on mortality (Barreca et al., 2016), but this form of adaptation to a warmer climate is only available if households can afford to run their air conditioners. Households that cannot afford cooling may be more susceptible to the effects of extreme heat, such as increased emergency room visits (White, 2017), poor mental health (Mullins and White, 2019b), diminished learning (Park et al., 2020), and death (Deschenes and Moretti, 2009). Climate policies also have distributional consequences, and may make energy less affordable. For example, both of Washington state’s failed 2016 and 2018 carbon tax initiatives would have increased energy prices, but only one made redistributing revenues to low-income households a priority (Anderson et al., 2019).====We estimate the relationship between temperature and energy spending for both low and higher-income households. Our analysis relies on household-level data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) for 2004–2018. We pair these data with mean daily temperatures aggregated to counts of days in temperature bins at the state-month level. U.S. households receive monthly bills that vary with energy use. We estimate the causal effect of additional hot or cold days on energy spending, allowing for heterogeneity by household poverty status. Because we include state-by-month fixed effects, temperature shocks (unseasonably hot or cold weather) provide identifying variation for our estimates.====We find low-income households’ energy spending is much less responsive to extreme weather than that of other households. Events like the 2017 polar vortex or the 2011 heat wave can sharply increase exposure to extreme weather: for example, in August 2011, Oklahoma experienced 14 more days with a daily average temperature above 30 C (86 F) than is typical. We estimate replacing a temperate day (15–20 C/59–68 F) with a very cold day (==== C/==== F) increases monthly energy spending by 1.2 percent for higher-income households but only 0.5 percent for low-income households. This difference of 0.7 percentage points is statistically significant. We refer to the muted spending response to extreme weather among low-income households relative to higher-income households as a “poverty gap”. This aggregate pattern of energy spending is driven by the fuels associated with heating and cooling: electricity spending exhibits a poverty gap at both extremes, while natural gas spending exhibits a poverty gap only for cold weather. Replacing a temperate day with a very hot day (==== C/==== F) increases electricity spending for higher-income households by 0.5 percent but does not increase electricity spending for low-income households. The implied magnitude of the difference in electricity use would power a typical air conditioner for four hours.====These differences are best explained by low-income households foregoing heating and cooling during extreme weather. We first show spending disparities reflect underlying differences in energy consumption, rather than differences in prices. We then find differences in consumption are not driven by lower energy needs for the dwellings of low-income households: our preferred specification yields estimates of proportional, not level, changes in energy spending, and estimates are robust within housing sizes and types. Nor are they driven by differences in AC availability: we find similar estimates for a sample where all households have AC. Instead, we propose differences in use during unseasonable weather reveal a pattern of low-income households opting for more extreme indoor temperatures. Surveys documenting systematic differences in energy efficiency – households experiencing poverty tend to live in homes that are leakier and more poorly insulated – suggest differences in energy consumption could even understate resulting differences in dwelling temperatures.====We find similar poverty gaps for food spending, consistent with low-income households cutting back on necessities to afford their energy bills. While food spending by higher-income households is unaffected by extreme weather, food spending by low-income households falls in response to additional days of extreme heat or cold. The resulting food spending poverty gaps are statistically significant and about twice as large as the energy poverty gaps. We focus on food because it is consistently Americans’ third greatest expense category, after housing and transportation, and it is likely more flexible in the short run than the other two (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2019). Liquidity constraints may explain why low-income households are unable to smooth these shocks.====Taken together, these results indicate energy assistance programs fail to adequately insulate low-income households from energy bill shocks. Our estimates corroborate surveys and qualitative studies that find energy insecurity is widespread among low-income households, and imply policies that raise energy prices will disproportionately impact low-income households. The symmetry of our findings – poverty gaps in energy spending that are of similar magnitudes for both hot and cold weather – suggests energy assistance programs focused primarily on winter heating costs may miss a substantial part of the burden of energy bills. While nearly all U.S. households use air conditioning in their home, the largest energy assistance program in the United States allocated over five times as much funding to heating assistance as it did to cooling assistance in 2014 (Perl, 2018). As the climate warms, social programs will also need to adapt.====We contribute to the literature by documenting a novel poverty gap in the energy spending response to hot weather. Previous work has found differential responses to extreme cold, but not extreme heat; we also provide contemporary estimates of the cold weather gap. Using data from 1980–1998, Bhattacharya et al. (2003) finds low-income households spend less on energy and food in response to extreme cold, compared to other households.==== More recently, Beatty et al. (2014) finds similar poverty gaps in response to unseasonable cold in the United Kingdom.==== Previous work also suggests the spending disparities we document lead to health disparities. (Frank et al., 2006) links participation in energy assistance to improved nutrition among low-income children; (Nord and Kantor, 2006) finds an association between increased energy costs and food insecurity; and Chirakijja et al. (2019) finds higher home heating costs increase mortality, especially in low-income counties.====We also contribute to the literature describing how climate damages vary across populations and highlighting how socioeconomic inequality leaves low-income households distinctly vulnerable to extreme temperature. (Mullins and White, 2019a) finds access to health care mitigates the effect of heat on mortality, and Garg et al. (2020) shows income lessens the effect of heat on test scores. Globally, increases in both temperatures and incomes will drive air conditioner adoption (Davis and Gertler, 2015). Finally, Barreca et al. (2016) attribute dramatic reductions in heat-related mortality to air conditioner access. Our results contextualize this finding. In countries like the United States, where income inequality is high and adoption is approaching saturation, air conditioner operating costs may be just as important as access for the distribution of climate damages.","Sweating the energy bill: Extreme weather, poor households, and the energy spending gap",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069622000018,20 January 2022,2022,Research Article,96.0

We find that the closures resulted in a 6 percent reduction in ","Despite dramatic declines in coal consumption and record numbers of coal-fired power plant closures in the United States (U.S.), coal continues to account for nearly one-quarter of the country’s electricity-generating fuel portfolio (MacIntyre and Jell, 2018, Mobilia and Comstock, 2019, Johnson and Chau, 2019, EIA, 2019). The burning of coal emits air pollution, including pollutants such as sulfur dioxide (SO====), nitrogen oxides (NO====), and particulate matter (PM). Although a growing literature in economics examines the effects of exposure to these and other specific pollutants – either in isolation or simultaneously – on human health and birth outcomes, little is known about the effects of exposure to coal-fired power plants on children.====Exposure to coal-fired power plants may be more harmful to children’s health and well-being than what previous evidence from the air pollution literature suggests for three reasons. First, in addition to plant emissions, other activities surrounding coal-fired power plants – including coal transport, storage, by-products, and disposal – negatively affect local air quality (Jha and Muller, 2018, Zierold and Odoh, 2020). Second, coal-fired power plants are known emitters of a host of pollutants – including mercury and other heavy metals – which have been shown to negatively affect children’s health (Bose-O’Reilly et al., 2010), but that are not typically measured in emissions inventories nor by air quality monitors. Omitted measures of these pollutants could bias estimates of coal-fired power plant effects that are solely based on measured pollutants, particularly if unmeasured pollutants have different dispersion patterns or if they impact children’s health through different channels, or on different time scales, than do other air pollutants. Finally, children are potentially more vulnerable to the negative effects of exposure to air pollution than adults are due to their (immature) developmental status, breathing patterns, time spent outdoors, and time spent in activities that raise ventilation (breathing) rates (Gauderman et al., 2004, Schwartz, 2004, Bateson and Schwartz, 2007).====In this paper, we address this gap in the literature by estimating the effect of exposure to coal-fired power plants on children in the short- and medium-run. We do this by exploiting a unique and previously unexplored context: public elementary schools’ proximities to operational coal-fired power plants. This context has the advantages of providing a setting where children spend a substantial amount of time each day (second in terms of average minutes only to time spent sleeping) (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2008) and in which a proxy for children’s health status (absences from school) is widely and uniformly measured among the population of public school children (Weitzman, 1986, Currie et al., 2009).==== This context also allows for in-depth examination of a potential mechanism – school absences – that could help to explain existing evidence on the short-run effects of air pollution exposure on student achievement and long-run effects on educational attainment and earnings.====We exploit variation induced by the closures of three large coal-fired power plants that were located in, or in close proximity to, Chicago, Illinois. During a six-month period in 2012, the Crawford, Fisk Street, and State Line Generating Stations all closed abruptly after decades of continuous operations. We use this natural experiment to estimate the effect of exposure to coal-fired power plants on school absences using data from fifteen Illinois school districts. This unique setting allows us to sharply identify short- and medium-term impacts on children who attended schools near the three coal-fired power plants. This natural experiment provides an ideal setting in which to study the effects of exposure to coal-fired power plants on school absences because the power plant closures were unexpected, induced large changes in local air quality, and had negligible impacts on employment in the Chicago area.====Using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that school-level rates of absences decreased by around 0.369 percentage points (6 percent) in schools located near the plants (within 10 kilometers) following the closures. In more readily interpretable units, this reduction translates into around 363 fewer absence-days annually for the typical (median) elementary school in our sample of impacted (or near) schools or 0.66 fewer absence-days per student per year. For several reasons we discuss later, we believe this estimate is likely to be a lower bound. In complementary event-study analyses, we analyze the dynamics underlying this average effect and find considerable evidence to suggest that the effect of the closures on absences gets increasingly more negative over time. We believe this to be consistent with both underlying health improvements in children that take time to materialize and with the possibility that absence rates continue to fall over time as younger students – with fewer years of exposure to the coal-fired power plants – “age-in” to school. In addition to our results overall, we investigate effects on absences for student subgroups. We find suggestive, although not conclusive, evidence that absence reductions were larger for boys than for girls, which we believe to be consistent with descriptive evidence on boys’ heightened underlying vulnerability (e.g., due to rates of diagnosed asthma, activity patterns, etc.). We do not find statistical evidence of differences in effects by student race/ethnicity nor by family income.====To gain insight into the specific mechanisms underlying our estimated effects on school absences, we consider two possibilities suggested by previous literature: Endogenous migration of higher-income families to areas near the coal-fired power plants following their closures (mediated through housing prices) and improvements in children’s respiratory health. We explore the possibility that higher-income (or otherwise socioeconomically advantaged) families moved into neighborhoods near the coal-fired power plants following their closures by examining housing values and the characteristics of students enrolled in nearby schools. We also examine the effects of the closures on children’s respiratory health by examining whether rates of emergency department visits for asthma-related conditions among school-age children responded to the closures. We do not find strong evidence of endogenous migration, but we do find large and meaningful reductions in emergency department visits for asthma-related conditions among school-age children in areas near the three plants.====We identify three main contributions of this paper to the existing literature. First, we add evidence on the effects of a permanent change in local air quality to a literature that is largely characterized by estimates generated from short-term air quality changes. Although our estimates are in-line with existing evidence on the impacts of short-term pollution spikes on absences (Chen et al., 2018, Currie et al., 2009, Liu and Salvo, 2018), our results demonstrate that permanent changes in air quality have lasting effects on student absences. Second, we document the existence of dynamics underlying average treatment effects, which offers new insight into the medium-run effects of permanent changes in air quality. A final contribution of this work is to examine the question of how exposure to coal-fired power plants affects children in a setting that has historically been characterized by inequality. It is well-documented in public health and environmental literatures that low-income and minoritized groups bear disproportionate burdens of exposure to poor air quality in the U.S. (Colmer et al., 2020, Hausman and Stolper, 2020, Richmond-Bryant et al., 2020). We document that this phenomenon extends to the locations of public schools.

"Dai Miao,Benchekroun Hassan,Long Ngo Van","Department of Economics and CIREQ, McGill University, Canada","Received 6 May 2021, Available online 21 December 2021, Version of Record 6 January 2022.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeem.2021.102597,Cited by (2),We examine the profitability of cross-ownership in a nonrenewable resource oligopolistic ,"Nonrenewable resource industries have experienced intense and widely documented cross-ownership activities mainly through partial acquisitions and joint ventures.==== As noted by Kumar (2012) and Benchekroun et al. (2019a), the volume of mergers and acquisitions has been historically and consistently much higher in the exhaustible sector than others. Many joint ventures exist in the nonrenewable resource sector, as firms often jointly own and/or develop a mine. For instance, in the global oil and gas industry, the top six multinational oil companies, i.e., ExxonMobile, British Petroleum (BP), Royal Dutch Shell, Chervon, Total and Eni, are more closely interconnected with each other than would be expected.==== According to a report by Water Street Partners based on the source from Rystad Energy,==== intriguingly large amounts of supermajor-to-supermajor joint-ventures exist in the production stage, let alone other stages such as exploration, refining, distributing and retailing. We seek to understand the incentives of rival firms to participate in cross-ownership and the levels of cross-shareholdings that will be profitable in nonrenewable resource industries. This will require investigating how ownership links between any rival firms may affect the use of a nonrenewable resource and whether increased cross-ownership will give rise to increased market power.====To better understand the role played by resource constraints, we start by examining the profitability of cross-ownership in a static game since it has not been addressed even in this benchmark framework.==== Specifically, we consider a k-symmetric cross-ownership structure in an ====-firm Cournot homogeneous-product model where a subset of ==== firms engage in rival cross-shareholdings and each firm has an equal silent financial interest in the other firms, while the remaining ==== firms stay independent. By examining the profitability of cross-ownership, we show that for any levels of non-controlling minority shareholdings, a k-symmetric cross-ownership is never profitable if the number of participating firms is below some lower threshold, but always profitable when the number of participating firms is above some upper threshold. When the number of participating firms is between these thresholds, the profitability of cross-ownership depends on the value of stakes that each firm involved in cross-ownership holds in the other firms. Cross-ownership is then profitable only when the stakes are below a certain threshold. This result seems surprising as one would naturally think it should be always profitable for firms to participate in cross-ownership due to a less intensified competition. We thus define this result as a cross-ownership paradox, analogous to the merger paradox. In general, firms have no incentive to engage in cross-shareholdings if less than 50% of the firms in the industry participate. However, beyond that participation ratio, for example, with ==== and ====, cross-ownership is profitable provided that each of the ==== firms holds no more than 6.5% of the shares of any other firm; with ==== and ====, cross-ownership is profitable provided that each of the ==== firms holds no more than 12.5% of the shares of any other firm; and with ==== and ====, cross-ownership is profitable provided that each of the ==== firms holds less than 17.6% of the shares of any other firm. Moreover, cross-ownership is always profitable for any non-controlling minority shareholdings if more than 80% of the firms participate. Thus a ====-symmetric cross-ownership is more likely to be profitable with lower levels of shareholdings for a lower participation ratio. The main intuition behind the result can be explained by cross-ownership theory and oligopoly theory. When a firm acquires a partial ownership stake in a rival, it has an incentive to compete less aggressively and thus unilaterally reduce its output. A larger shareholding by the firms that engage in the symmetric cross-ownership will induce them to further reduce output, triggering a more aggressive response by the outsiders in terms of strategic substitutes in Cournot competition. The increase in both the number and output of the outsiders more than offsets the benefit the cross-owners can receive from their reduction of output, thereby reducing the profitability of cross-ownership.====We show that the conclusions reached in the static benchmark above may not be extendable to the case of nonrenewable resource oligopolies. The output of each resource extracting firm, i.e., their cumulative extraction over time, is constrained by their limited initial resource stocks. As a result, current extraction and production affect the availability of reserves for future extraction and production (Hotelling, 1931). To capture the specificity of the nonrenewable resource sector, we use a dynamic game model in which firms compete à la Cournot while each firm faces a resource stock constraint. We use a continuous time framework with an endogenous time horizon. Following much of the existing literature on oligopoly models of nonrenewable resource markets (Salant, 1976, Lewis and Schmalensee, 1980, Loury, 1986, Benchekroun et al., 2009, Benchekroun et al., 2010, Benchekroun et al., 2019a) , we adopt the open-loop strategies by which firms commit to a fixed time path of extraction. We acknowledge that open-loop Nash equilibrium (OLNE) is only time-consistent but not necessarily subgame perfect.==== If firms have all the information about its own and competitors’ stocks at any future dates, they would be able to adjust their production at each instant of time, i.e., use closed-loop or Markov strategies. However, there are several reasons to justify the use of OLNE as noted in Benchekroun et al. (2019b). The first justification is the analytical tractability, as one has to resort to numerical methods to characterize a closed-loop equilibrium, but such methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality. The second is the prevalence of long-term contracts in nonrenewable resource markets so that actual extraction rates do not only depend on the actual resource stocks but also from the pre-committed supplies. Finally, requiring information on the vector of stocks at each moment can be quite unrealistic given the difficulty to gather that information. We then characterize an open-loop Nash–Cournot cross-ownership equilibrium (OL-NCOE) of the game and investigate the profitability of a k-symmetric cross-ownership in this context. We find that a k-symmetric cross-ownership can be profitable even when the participation ratio is below the lower threshold and is always profitable when above the lower threshold, provided that the initial resource stock owned by each firm is small enough. Moreover, the profitability increases in levels of cross-ownership when resource stock owned by each firm is small. This result sharply contrasts with the static model in which lower levels of cross-ownership seem more profitable. Unlike the static model in which outsiders respond to any increased shareholdings between cross-owners by aggressively increasing output and mitigating the cross-ownership participants’ gain in market power, the limited resource stocks restrict the outsiders in their response. Consequently, when the stock is sufficiently small, a higher level of cross-ownership will generate a higher profitability.====In addition, a k-symmetric cross-ownership results in a slower extraction rate for the industry and induces the outsiders to exhaust their stocks earlier than the cross-ownership participants at any resource stock level. These findings indicate that the degree of concentration in supply will increase over time, and a group of cross-owners will eventually supply the resource before exhaustion. This result resembles the ‘oil’igopoly theory (Loury, 1986, Polasky, 1992), which predicts that small firms will exhaust their stocks before large firms do, leading possibly to eventual monopolization of the market. The increased concentration over time induced by cross-ownership confers market power on those cross-owners. As such, the cross-ownership participants can raise prices more than in other industries without stock constraint, which provides an additional incentive to look at the exhaustible sector differently.====Our paper also contrasts cross-ownership with horizontal mergers. One of the seminal works in the literature is arguably the paper by Salant et al. (1983), who show that the seemingly profitable mergers between competing firms in the same industry can be unprofitable, which is known as the merger paradox. More specifically, when firms compete à la Cournot in an oligopolistic industry with linear demand and constant marginal cost of production, horizontal mergers are not profitable unless at least 80% of the industry participates in the merger. Since cross-ownership is often referred to as “partial mergers”, one may wonder why firms do not engage in a full merger in the first place, as a merger totally eliminates the previous rivalry and can pool resources more efficiently. Foros et al. (2011) answer this question by showing that in a spatial Salop 3-firm Bertrand model with differentiated products, the profitability of a partial cross-ownership that gives the acquirer corporate control over all pricing decisions could be much higher than that of a full merger because a partial ownership arrangement can greatly lessen competition when the firms’ choices are strategic complements. Stühmeier (2016) extends their 3-firm setting with four or more firms, only to find that firms prefer a merger to a partial acquisition, because both neighbors to the entity respond differently to the acquisition. Thus he concludes that whether partial acquisition is preferable to a merger is sensitive to the intensity of competition in the market. However, these papers only consider Bertrand competition whereas there are numerous industries in which firms compete in a way that is more consistent with Cournot competition. Using models with price competition to investigate quantity competition would often end up with unreliable results and give misleading policy implications. Our paper thus provides a possible explanation as to why cross-ownership is preferable to a full merger in terms of Cournot competition. For example, as indicated earlier, when ==== and ====, cross-ownership is profitable provided that each of the 6 firms holds no more than 6.5% of the non-controlling minority shares of any other firm, while a horizontal merger of 6 firms is unprofitable.====This result also bears some practical considerations from a company’s corporate strategy point of view. Not only is participating in cross-ownership more profitable than a horizontal merger, but – more importantly – it constitutes a “smart” way to avoid the possible legal challenges. While horizontal mergers are subject to substantial antitrust scrutiny and are often opposed by antitrust authorities, non-controlling minority shareholdings are either granted a de facto exemption from antitrust liability or have gone unchallenged by antitrust agencies (Gilo, 2000, Gilo et al., 2006). Indeed, Nain and Wang (2018) document that fewer than 1% of the minority acquisitions are challenged by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or the Department of Justice (DOJ), and even fewer are blocked outright. Antitrust authorities of the European Union (EU) do not even have competence to investigate such cases.==== As noted by Jovanovic and Wey (2014), in many merger cases, the acquiring firm often proposes a passive cross-ownership in the target firm before a full merger. This two-step covert takeover strategy has two central benefits: first, it evades merger scrutiny when antitrust authorities often give the green light to non-controlling minority shareholdings; second, it achieves the eventual goal of a full acquisition on the basis of increasing consumer surplus approved by antitrust authorities. Therefore, firms may view cross-ownership as a more attractive corporate strategy, further explaining why firms want to engage in cross-shareholdings. Our analysis thus suggests that competition authorities should adapt their current lenient approach towards minority shareholdings to a stricter regulation.====In the absence of any possible efficiency gains, passive cross-shareholdings result in a welfare loss, and thus competition authorities should rule against them in accordance with a total surplus criterion.==== However, when competition authorities need to make the tradeoffs between the possible efficiency gains and the welfare loss brought by cross-ownership, they should be cautious when ruling in the nonrenewable resource sector. As when the resource stock owned by each firm is small enough, cross-ownership results in a relatively smaller welfare loss than in a static Cournot oligopoly. This is because a group of cross-owners will monopolize the market after the outsiders deplete their resource stocks. As such, they can substantially raise the price, which slows down resource extraction and extends the date of exhaustion. As the resource becomes increasingly scarce, the extended periods of the use of the resource partially offset the negative effect of the higher price on social welfare.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents first a static model used as a benchmark and then the dynamic model of a nonrenewable resource industry. Section 3 analyzes the profitability of cross-ownership. Section 4 provides a welfare analysis. Section 5 conducts a comparative static analysis.

The paper uses detailed country–species–level fisheries data to estimate the causal effect of a fishery’s exports on the collapse of the fishery. Identification is based on an export demand shock originating from Japan. The results reveal that an increase in logged exports by one ==== raises the probability of a fishery’s collapse in the following year by 31 percentage points. Particularly fisheries without catch share programs collapse when exports surge.,"The depletion of renewable resources is becoming ever more prevalent. Forest cover loss, fisheries collapse, and the endangered status of countless animal and plant species are prominent examples (FAO, 2016a, Pinsky et al., 2011, Costello et al., 2012, IUCN, 2018). Renewable resources are important export products, particularly in the developing world, yet we still have a poor understanding of the extent to which trade contributes to resource depletion and collapse. Empirical studies on trade in renewable resources are limited by at least one of the following: a lack of causal inference, a lack of species level information on trade flows and resource stocks, and a lack of external validity due to a focus on selected species. Existing research focuses on the effect of trade in forest products (Abman and Lundberg, 2020, Faria and Almeida, 2016, Ferreira, 2004, Tsurumi and Managi, 2014), ivory (Barbier et al., 1990) and buffalos hides (Taylor, 2011). Causal insights on the effect of fisheries exports on fish stocks are missing.====This paper uses detailed fisheries data to estimate the causal effect of a fishery’s exports on the collapse of the fishery. The paper employs a novel identification strategy, using an export demand shock originating from Japan as an instrument for exports in the rest of the world. The use of country–species–year level data on trade in fishery products yields detailed insights about the way exports affect the collapse of numerous different fish species. The results suggest that an increase in exports leads to a large increase in the probability of a collapse. When logged exports increase by one standard deviation, the probability of a collapse in the following year increases by 31 percentage points.====Fisheries are a particularly interesting resource to study since they are both highly traded and threatened by resource collapse. Indeed, fishery products have become one of the most highly traded food commodities and more than one third of global fish production is exported (FAO, 2016b). At the same time, the world’s fisheries are overfished and between 17% and 25% of the world’s fisheries have collapsed (Pinsky et al., 2011, Costello et al., 2012). This begs the question whether exports cause the collapse of fisheries.====Insights on the effect of fisheries exports on fisheries collapse are especially important for developing countries, which produce more than half of global fisheries exports (FAO, 2016b). In the developing world, fisheries generate up to 50% of export revenue (Bellmann et al., 2016) as well as employment for more than 37 million people (FAO, 2016b). Moreover, fish is an important source of animal protein for consumers around the world. Yet, all of these benefits are short-lived if fisheries collapse as a result of exports.====From a theoretical point of view, open access renewable resources do not necessarily collapse in exporting countries. Brander and Taylor, 1997a, Brander and Taylor, 1997b, Brander and Taylor, 1998, Chichilnisky, 1994 and Hannesson (2000) show that the resource stock declines when a country exports an open access renewable resource. However, only Copeland and Taylor (2006) and Gars and Spiro (2018) discuss the possibility of a complete depletion of the resource stock.====To guide the empirical estimation, this paper illustrates that an increase in the resource price and the associated increase in exports can cause the collapse of an open access renewable resource. The illustration is based on a Ricardian model similar to Brander and Taylor (1997a) and Copeland and Taylor (2006) and the paper focuses on a situation in which an export demand shock leads to an exogenous increase in the resource price. This increase in the price makes harvesting more lucrative and, as a result, the country harvests and exports more of the renewable resource. Since harvest exceeds resource growth, the resource stock shrinks over time. At high world market prices, exporting can lead to the collapse of an open access renewable resource if harvesting capacity is high relative to the resource growth rate.====The empirical analysis provides the first estimate of the causal effect of fisheries exports on the collapse of fisheries. This paper uses a standard definition of fisheries collapse (see e.g. Worm et al., 2006, Costello et al., 2008) and defines a species in a particular country as collapsed if catch within the country’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is below 10 percent of the maximum historical catch recorded since 1950. The use of a catch-based proxy for fisheries depletion is necessary since catch data are far more widely available than stock assessments. Scientific stock assessments are sparse and they mostly focus on high value and often well-managed stocks in the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Hence, assessed fisheries do not represent a random sample and an analysis based on assessed stocks cannot shed light on dynamics in major exporting fisheries in the developing world.====The collapse of fisheries within Japan’s EEZ is used as an instrument for exports of fishery products in order to make causal inference. The analysis exploits substantial variation in the collapse of fisheries within Japan’s EEZ at the species–year level. Since Japan is one of the largest markets for seafood products, the collapse of a fish species in Japan raises the world market price and spurs exports of the affected species from other countries. The instrumental variable estimation is necessary since both exports and the probability of a collapse in the following year depend on the size of the fish stock, which is unobserved. Therefore, the results from a simple OLS regression would be biased downwards.====The empirical strategy takes two steps to ensure that trade is the only channel through which a collapse in Japan can affect a collapse in the exporting country. First, the sample does not include fisheries that are shared between Japan and the exporter. When stocks are shared, a collapse of a species in Japan could directly affect the collapse in the exporting country. Second, the empirical model controls for other economic, biological, and climatic factors that could lead to the collapse of fisheries in both countries.====The analysis is based on a comprehensive country–species level panel dataset, which allows for both detailed and broadly applicable insights on the effect of exports on resource depletion. Insights are detailed since the analysis links trade flows to data on fisheries collapse for every species in every country in the dataset. Every country–species combination represents one fishery in the context of this paper. The panel dataset covers around 100 countries and more than 100 fish species from 1976 to 2006. Due to the large number of species in the dataset, the results provide more external validity than most other studies in the literature on trade in renewable resources.====The paper shows that exports significantly contribute to the collapse of fisheries. The results suggest that an increase in exports by one percent raises the probability of a fishery’s collapse in the following year by around 0.1 percentage points. This effect is large, particularly considering the surge in exports of fishery products in the last few decades. Exports in the median fishery grew by 52 percent between 1991 and 2006. According to the estimates, this export boom raised the probability of a collapse by 6 percentage points. A comparison with the rate of fisheries collapse in the sample helps to put this number into perspective. The rate of collapse was calculated for fisheries that report export data in 1991 and 2006 and are not collapsed in 1991. Twenty percent of these fisheries collapsed at least once between 1991 and 2006. Hence, median export growth predicts almost one third of the observed rate of collapse in this sample.====The use of price data allows for a more direct test of the theoretical model and confirms the insights gained from export data. The result suggest that an increase in the ex-vessel price raises exports and the probability of a collapse. However, those results are slightly more tentative since price data are mostly estimated and the collapse in Japan is a weak instrument for prices. Therefore, the analysis focuses on exports rather than prices as a regressor of interest.====Due to the sparsity of stock assessments, this paper infers the collapse of fisheries based on catch data. However, several authors have highlighted that the catch-based method measures the true depletion of fish stocks with error (Li and Smith, 2021, Carruthers et al., 2012, Branch et al., 2011, Daan et al., 2011). This is the case since catch is affected by a number of factors beyond biomass, such as input and output prices or fisheries management.====This paper takes several steps to ensure that measurement error in fisheries collapse does not drive the results. First, it uses the best available stock data and complements them with estimates of stock biomass from Costello et al. (2016). The insights point in the same direction with this alternative dataset. Second, the results are largely robust to changing the definition of fisheries collapse such that the threshold for a collapse is either less than or more than 10 percent of maximum historical catch.====This paper contributes to the existing empirical literature on trade in renewable resources in three main ways. First, it estimates the causal effect of exports on the depletion of a renewable resource using a novel instrumental variable.====Second, this paper provides better estimates of the effect of resource exports on resource depletion since it uses relevant information on resource trade flows at a very disaggregated level. To be precise, the analysis is based on species level fisheries exports, whereas existing papers use country level exports plus imports relative to GDP (see e.g. Ferreira, 2004, Faria and Almeida, 2016, Erhardt, 2018) or the implementation of regional trade agreements (Abman and Lundberg, 2020) as measures for trade openness. The use of species-level resource trade flows allows for a crucial distinction between effects of resource exports and imports. A country can export some fish species and import other fish species. Trade openness would protect the stocks of imported species==== (Brander and Taylor, 1997a, Brander and Taylor, 1997b) and deplete stocks of exported species. This important distinction is lost in existing analyses using aggregate country-level datasets.====Finally, this paper analyses the effect of fisheries exports on the depletion of a broad set of fisheries, whereas most of the existing literature focuses on other resources. To date, Erhardt and Weder, 2015, Erhardt, 2018 provide the only empirical analyses of the relationship between trade openness and overfishing. However, neither of those papers can quantify the effect of fisheries exports on the depletion of fisheries due to a lack of fisheries trade data.==== Based on both detailed and comprehensive fisheries trade data and a novel instrumental variable, this paper can, for the first time, estimate the causal effect of exports from a particular fishery on the collapse of that fishery.====This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 illustrates the theoretical background for the analysis. The empirical strategy is presented in Section 3, which discusses the potential bias in the OLS regression and explains the choice of the instrument as well as the estimating equation. Section 4 explains the construction of the exceptionally detailed dataset and describes relevant patterns in the data. The results from a benchmark OLS regression and the instrumental variable regressions are presented in Section 5. Section 5 also investigates whether the effect of exports depends on fisheries management. Dynamics are discussed in Section 6. This is followed by a sensitivity analysis in Section 7.

We find that technology must be regulated in addition to emissions, even in the absence of technological ====. Under a quantity agreement, emission is capped and countries must either overinvest in technology—to weaken the temptation to emit—or they must be punished unless they invest less—to maintain their willingness to retaliate on others. Under a price agreement, emission is taxed and investments subsidized. The price agreement dominates the quantity agreement because when firms are free to modify investment levels if another government defects, the punishment for defection is stronger.","The fundamental challenge in achieving international cooperation is to motivate countries to cooperate rather than free ride. In the absence of a world government, countries may need to rely on reputation and repeated play. However, it is doubtful whether the prospect of future cooperation is sufficient to motivate cooperation in the present. A country will be tempted to increase its emissions or to reduce its abatement effort, especially when immediate retaliation is unfeasible. This will be more tempting for countries that rely on fossil fuels, but less so for countries that have invested in renewable energy. Thus, the technology levels will influence the temptation to emit.====This observation leads to a number of important questions. What are the characteristics of the best agreement, if the first best cannot be attained? Should countries be required to invest more in renewable energy, so as to be less tempted to emit, or invest less, and therefore have the ability to credibly punish if others defect? Which policy implements the best self-enforcing agreement? Is a rigid quantity agreement better or worse than a flexible price agreement?====To answer these questions, Section 2 presents a game between countries. Each country is run by a benevolent government and has a large number of price-taking firms that choose how much to invest in renewables, before consumers choose fossil fuel consumption level. Under the quantity agreement, analyzed in Section 3, governments of all countries set emission quotas and investment mandates. Under the price agreement, analyzed in Section 4, governments specify emission taxes and investment subsidies. To isolate the role of technology, we abstract from technological spillovers. We assume that governments cannot commit, so that investment policies are set just before firms invest, while emission policies are set just before consumers emit. This extensive-form game is repeated indefinitely. International coordination on the best subgame-perfect equilibrium (SPE) is supported by a reversion to the “business-as-usual” Markov-perfect equilibrium (MPE).====Under a quantity agreement, there are two alternative types of distortions when the discount factor is too small to support the first best. Suppose, first, that technology is expensive relative to the cost of reducing consumption. In this case, the first-best investment level is low and the greatest temptation is to deviate from the cooperative emission quantity. To motivate compliance when the discount factor is low, countries must be allowed to emit more than the first-best level. In order to mitigate the necessity to increase the emission level, it is optimal to require countries to invest more in renewables, that is, more than they would find to be optimal ==== on the equilibrium emission level. By requiring overinvestment in order that countries will have an overabundance of renewable energy, the temptation to defect by emitting more is weakened, and the necessary increase in the emission quantity (to motivate compliance) is smaller.====In contrast, if technology is inexpensive, or if it is costly to reduce consumption, then the first-best investment level is high and the temptation to defect is greatest at the investment stage. To reduce this temptation, countries must be required to invest less than the levels they would find to be optimal given the agreed-upon emission quantity. In principle, for a fixed emission quantity, an increase in investment leads to Pareto improvements. This, however, limits the possibility to punish, i.e., by emitting more, if another country defects, thus making it tempting to defect at the investment stage. To reduce this temptation, countries must be punished so that they will invest less.====A price agreement produces a different set of incentives. When the discount factor is large, the first best is implemented by a Pigouvian tax and no investment subsidy. If a country defected at the investment policy stage, then it will have to discourage firms from investing. When this is observed by firms in other countries, they will realize that cooperation is about to end, and as a result emissions will increase and the demand for technology will fall. Thus, firms in non-deviating countries will also invest less, and in turn emission levels in those countries will be higher at the subsequent emission policy stage. For this reason, the punishment is stronger and the temptation to defect is lower at the investment policy stage under a price agreement than under a quantity agreement.====This logic also explains why it is always more tempting under a price agreement to defect at the emission policy stage than at the investment policy stage. The harder it is to motivate compliance (i.e., the smaller is the discount factor), the lower the equilibrium emission tax will need to be. To maintain the incentive to invest in this situation, green technology investment must be subsidized, thus reducing the temptation to emit and making it possible to motivate compliance without a large increase in the permitted emission quantity.====Section 5 compares the payoffs sustained by the two designs and shows that a price agreement weakly Pareto dominates a quantity agreement. When technology is costly, the two designs are identical since the compliance constraint at the emission stage binds first under both types of agreement. In contrast, when technology is inexpensive, the price agreement is superior since the compliance constraint may bind at the investment stage under the quantity agreement, though not under the price agreement. Under a price agreement, firms in non-deviating countries invest less, and the subsequent punishment (in terms of higher emissions) will be stronger if a country defects. Under investment mandates, however, these firms will have to stick to that mandate. The comparison between the two designs therefore uncovers a novel reason to justify why flexible instruments can be preferred to rigid quantity mandates.====Section 6 extends the baseline model by introducing imperfect transparency of domestic climate policies, and shows how different types of observational errors affect the design of the optimal agreement. In the presence of type II errors, a defection might go unnoticed. In this case, the temptation to defect at the investment policy stage can be the strongest also under a price agreement and investment in green technology may need to be punished through a tax when transparency is sufficiently low. In the presence of type I errors, countries might punish one another even if everyone has complied. In this case, firms can mistakenly react to what they believe are defections in other countries and induce unduly strong punishments, which lower the equilibrium payoff. Hence, flexible instruments can be detrimental for cooperation when transparency is imperfect.====Section 7 discusses the importance of the sequential timing of climate policies in the optimal design of the agreement. When climate policies are set simultaneously at the beginning of each period, technology investments do not influence compliance incentives with emission abatement, implying that there is no point in distorting the investment decision. In this case, a price agreement is welfare equivalent to a quantity agreement, and the equilibrium payoff is lower than under the sequential timing. Section 7 also argues that the main results hold even when stocks are long-lasting and investors have market power.==== The basic setup of the model follows Battaglini and Harstad (2016), which in turn draws on Harstad, 2012, Harstad, 2016. However, unlike the current model, they study MPEs and permit commitments to future contribution levels.====Several papers study repeated games (Mailath and Samuelson, 2006) and examine self-enforcing environmental agreements (see, among others, Barrett, 1994, Barrett, 2006, Dutta and Radner, 2004, Dutta and Radner, 2006, Kerr et al., 2020). However, they abstract from how technology can motivate compliance. This interaction has only been discussed previously by Harstad et al. (2019) who restricted their attention to binary emission levels.==== By allowing the emission levels to be continuous, the current analysis makes two important contributions.====First, we show that the best SPE does not necessarily require countries to overinvest in green technology (as in Harstad et al., 2019). When the technology is relatively inexpensive, one must instead punish countries for not reducing their investment in green technology. This links the study of self-enforcing environmental agreements to the industrial organization literature which looks at how firms can sustain collusion by overinvesting in capacity (see, Brock and Scheinkman, 1985, Benoit and Krishna, 1987, Davidson and Deneckere, 1990, and Compte et al., 2002). In that literature, firms overinvest in order to increase their ability to punish if another firm sells too much. This strategy is analogous to how countries may need to underinvest in green technology since that too enables the players to punish if someone defects. The strategies to underinvest (and thus increase the punishment) and to overinvest (and thus reduce one’s own temptation) are mutually exclusive, but both are possible in our model, which unambiguously determines when one, rather than the other, is optimal.====Second, the continuous emission level makes it meaningful to analyze the optimal price instrument. This analysis leads to the novel finding that investments must be regulated, even if there is no technological spillover, because technology influences the temptation to emit.==== This result adds to the literature on whether two instruments are necessary in order to mitigate climate change (see Acemoglu et al., 2012, Golosov et al., 2014). Because a defection allows firms to react under a price agreement (by investing less), but not under a quantity agreement, we also derive a novel advantage of the flexible price instrument, relative to the rigid quantity mandate. Thus, the model contributes to the debate on the optimality of price regulation versus quantity regulation (see, Weitzman, 1974, and the subsequent literature), by studying the dilemma under a self-enforcing agreement.",Prices vs. quantities for self-enforcing agreements,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069621001376,16 December 2021,2021,Research Article,101.0

Yet, governments are reluctant to take significant measures to reduce emissions, including decisive taxes on carbon. This resistance is partly due to the concern that an increase in the price of energy could harm domestic producers by increasing the cost of a key production input (Rentschler et al., 2017). The argument is particularly salient in industrializing countries where governments often subsidize fuel consumption by keeping fuel prices below market prices.====This paper uses data from two large developing countries (Indonesia and Mexico) to provide novel evidence that increases in energy prices do not necessarily worsen the performance of manufacturing firms. These countries provide a suitable context for the analysis for three main reasons. First, energy prices in both countries are subject to frequent variations both across plants and over time, and such changes may be traced back to institutional and geographical factors exogenous to the plants. Second, unlike most other developing countries, Indonesia and Mexico collect rich panel data of manufacturing plants, which include critical information for the estimation. Third, the results of the analyses can inform the policy discussion on the phasing out of fuel subsidies in both countries, which is opposed also on the grounds of industrial competitiveness arguments.====The key innovation of the analysis is testing for the impact of energy price variations separately for electricity and fuels, the two main types of energy used by manufacturing firms. This represents a departure from most of the literature on energy prices and plants’ performance, which has focused on electricity (e.g., Abeberese, 2017, Allcott et al., 2016, Fried and Lagakos, 2019, Marin and Vona, 2017).====However fuels account for a large share of energy sources used by the plants. In Indonesia and Mexico for instance fuels account for around two third of manufacturing plants’ energy expenditures in 2015 (as shown below). Distinguishing between energy sources is important as they power different types of capital equipment. Electric heating technologies are typically more energy-efficient and more productive than fuel-powered ones (EPRI, 2007). A case in point is the boiler, which is used to produce heat in virtually all manufacturing industries: fuel-powered boilers tend to be older, less energy-efficient and less productive than electricity-powered ones (Malek, 2005). This is also consistent with our data and case studies from the engineering literature. Additional examples of capital equipment used in manufacturing production that can be powered by both fuel and electricity include industrial dryers, air compressors, rototillers, chainsaws, motors, ovens, excavators, etc. A recent report (McKinsey, 2020) shows that almost 50% of industrial operations (from low temperature such as washing and food preparation to high temperature such as cracking in the petrochemical industry) present a financially viable switch from fuel to electricity.==== As a result, variations in relative prices could shape incentives to adopt different vintages of capital equipment.====As it turns out, the effects of price changes are markedly different between fuels and electricity. We find that increases in fuel prices result in higher productivity and profits among manufacturing plants. Our estimates imply that for Mexico, a 10% increase in fuel prices leads to an increase of 1.4% in Revenue Total Factor Productivity (TFPR) and a 14% in profits; for Indonesia, a 10% increase in fuel prices raises productivity by 1.6% and profits by 18%.====A battery of tests suggests that these effects are mainly driven by the replacement of older fuel-powered capital with more efficient and electricity-intensive capital in response to fuel price increases (keeping electricity prices constant). We find that in both countries higher fuel prices trigger the sale of machinery and the purchase of new equipment, and an increase in electricity consumption per unit of capital. While the switch towards electric machinery induced by fuel price hikes is to be expected, we also find that this results in higher quantity-TFP (TFPQ), a key measure of technical efficiency.==== This is consistent with the hypothesis that higher fuel prices trigger technological upgrading among laggard plants. In line with this interpretation, we also find that the positive impact of fuel prices on machinery turnover is muted for electricity-intensive plants – for which the scope for technological upgrading in response to fuel price is reduced – as well as for foreign plants, which are more likely to use technology closer to the frontier (Blackman and Wu, 1999, Guadalupe et al., 2012, Brucal et al., 2018).====Unlike for fuels, we do not find a positive impact of electricity prices on plants’ performance. This result is consistent with the fact that electricity prices do not incentivize productivity-enhancing capital replacement, because electricity powers technologies that are already on the efficiency frontier. Hence plants have less room to improve the capital vintage as a result of electricity price movements. In the absence of the capital replacement channel, rising electricity prices turn out to have a negative impact on plants’ performance and profits, in line with previous literature (Abeberese, 2017, Marin and Vona, 2017).====One advantage of the Indonesian and Mexican manufacturing data is that they include detailed information on outputs and inputs for each plant over time. However only the Indonesian data includes value and quantity of energy consumed, which allows estimating plant-specific unit prices for electricity and fuels. The Mexican data includes only the total plant-level expenditures on electricity and on other fuels. Hence to estimate plant-level energy prices for Mexico, we combine various sources of data. For electricity we combine monthly data on regional electricity tariffs by firm size with plant-specific sales, electricity expenditures and monthly production. To construct fuel prices we match sector-specific fuels’ consumption with monthly fuel price data and plant-specific monthly production data.====A challenge with these energy prices is that they are endogenous with respect to plant-level outcomes. This problem is less severe for Mexico as the plant-level data are constructed using national, sectoral, and regional data. To address these endogeneity concerns we instrument energy prices in both countries. For Indonesia we use energy prices of neighboring plants and for Mexico the average energy prices of plants from the same sector and state (excluding the firm analyzed in each case). Despite the differences in the data, instrumental variables and structure of the two economies, the result that increases in fuels prices boost performance is remarkably robust across countries. This robustness relieves the concerns on the external validity of the results that typically affect single country empirical analyses.====To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper providing systematic evidence on higher factor costs leading to a more productive use of resources and higher profits. In the energy literature, such a possibility is known as the strong version of the Porter Hypothesis, which was theorized by Porter and Van der Linde (1995). In its strong version, the Porter Hypothesis states that stricter environmental policy can induce firms to invest in better technology that not only results in higher productivity, but also higher profits. The strong version of the Porter Hypothesis has not received empirical support to date.====This lack of support is particularly salient given that the strong Porter hypothesis is at odds with standard classes of models with no market imperfections and profit-maximizing producers. Under those conditions, an increase in factor cost must necessarily lead to worse performance: if profitable opportunities existed before the price increase, rational producers would already be exploiting them. For instance, Xepapadeas and de Zeeuw (1999) present a model in which carbon taxes induce a modernization of the capital vintage and increase average productivity, but reduce profits.====Instead, with market imperfections it is theoretically possible to have a positive link between factor prices and profits. For instance, within a standard model of directed technical change, Acemoglu (2010) shows that market power in the technology-producing sector can lead firms not to choose the profit-maximizing technology. In that model, the increase in price of a factor can induce adoption of a technology which “saves” on that factor, ultimately resulting in higher profits.====A growing literature finds evidence of market imperfections and bounded rationality even in advanced economies, which help explain the slow adoption of energy efficient technology even in the presence of positive net present value of the investment (McKinsey, 2009, Anderson and Newell, 2004, DeCanio and Watkins, 1998, DeCanio, 1993, Poterba and Summers, 1995). In addition, a number of case studies suggest that investment in technology undertaken with the primary objective of increasing energy-efficiency often provide surprisingly high productivity gains.==== Findings in Ryan, 2018, Bloom et al., 2013 suggest that the frictions responsible for sub-optimal investment decisions might be even more severe in less advanced countries.====The incentives to gather and process information about energy-efficient technological opportunities might be particularly low in countries such as Indonesia and Mexico, where energy prices are heavily subsidized. Our finding that the positive impact of fuel prices on investment is muted for foreign and exporting plants provides further support to the market frictions and bounded rationality hypothesis, as information frictions and deviation from profit-maximizing behavior are likely to be more limited for these firms.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

We test this theory using forty years of U.S. state-level data measuring ,"Around the time that oil prices were starting to surge in the mid 2000s, the Public Integrity Section of the Department of Justice, in collaboration with the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), initiated a widespread investigation of public corruption in the state of Alaska. Central to their investigation was a man named Bill Allen, the CEO of a large oil-services company, VECO, and a host of state legislators who jokingly referred to themselves as being members of a “Corrupt Bastards Club”. Reports at the time suggested that a handful of state legislators were accepting illegal bribes in exchange for their support of a proposed natural gas pipeline and reductions in the oil tax rate. In their book, ====, authors Amanda Coyne and Tony Hopfinger write that: ====As part of their investigation, the FBI placed hidden cameras in the so-called “Animal House”, which exposed various state legislators being handed one hundred dollar bills from Bill Allen, allegedly in exchange for their support of, among other things, an oil tax cut (Coyne and Hopfinger, 2011).==== In the end, six legislators—one-tenth of the Alaska state legislature—would be convicted of political corruption and wrongdoing (Demer, 2017).====Is the Alaskan corruption scandal an isolated case of a “political resource curse”, or is oil more generally associated with political corruption? We answer this question using forty years of U.S. state data. We measure corruption in two ways. First, we use the number of corruption-related convictions that were prosecuted by the Public Integrity Section of the Justice Department. While this is a common measure of corruption in the United States (Glaeser and Saks, 2006, Depken and Lafountain, 2006, Apergis et al., 2010, Johnson et al., 2011, Cordis, 2014, Grooms, 2015, Dincer and Fredriksson, 2018), it is not well suited to measure the severity of criminal activity nor to differentiate between, say, the prosecution of a local school board member and a sitting governor. To address these shortcomings, we also measure corruption as “reflections” of it, a metric based on the frequency that words like “corrupt”, “fraud”, and “bribe”—and their various iterations—appear in local news covered by the Associated Press. Because severe criminal misconduct garners more public interest than minor violations, this measure of corruption serves as a proxy for the intensity of political corruption.====To causally identify the effect of oil on political corruption, we employ a set of difference-in-differences estimation equations that allow us to measure the relationship between oil and corruption during periods of high and low oil prices while controlling for time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity common to oil-rich and non-oil-rich states. This approach reveals that oil-rich states experience more corruption than non-oil-rich states when oil prices are high compared to when they are low. For example, the oil-price shock of the 2000s caused convictions of corruption in key oil-rich states to increase by roughly 45%. This amounts to approximately one additional conviction per million people. For reference, averaged over all state-year combinations, the average conviction rate is 1.94 convictions per million people, and the maximum is 26.17 (Montana in 1997, followed by North Dakota with 25.28 convictions per million people in 2003). Our results are largely robust to a variety of specifications in which we vary the definition of oil wealth, limit the set of control states in various ways, and alter the definition of oil “boom” years. We also employ a dynamic difference-in-differences strategy which shows that treatment effects tend to rise and fall in tandem with the timing of major oil-price shocks.====Our work makes several contributions to the existing literature. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to provide causal evidence of the relationship between oil and political corruption in the United States. Existing economics and political science literature have surprisingly little to say about this, although cross-country studies support the idea that natural resources—particularly point resources such as oil—reduce the quality of democratic institutions and cause corruption (Leite and Weidmann, 1999, Ades and Di Tella, 1999, Treisman, 2000, Bhattacharyya and Hodler, 2010, Vicente, 2010, Arezki and Brückner, 2011, Tsui, 2011, Caselli and Michaels, 2013, Brollo et al., 2013, Caselli and Tesei, 2016). Extending this literature to the U.S. state-level offers many advantages. First, cross-country comparisons are often frustrated by unobserved heterogeneity and endogeneity bias (Van der Ploeg, 2011).==== Robust causal inference is more easily achieved using subnational datasets in which relevant factors like institutional quality, language, history, and culture are homogeneously distributed relative to more aggregated settings. Second, while oil tends to be associated with more corruption in settings with weak institutions (Bhattacharyya and Hodler, 2010, Brollo et al., 2013, Caselli and Michaels, 2013), it is not obvious that this pattern holds within the United States where institutions are relatively strong. Understanding the relationship between oil and corruption in the U.S. is important from a theoretical perspective as the political resource curse literature has highlighted the role of institutions as a factor that ameliorates some of the perverse political incentives that resource windfalls create (Robinson et al., 2006). Yet, our results show that some of these perverse incentives prevail within an environment of strong institutions. This finding is practically relevant for policy makers as well, as corruption has been linked to several economic and public policy outcomes within the United States (Glaeser and Saks, 2006, Johnson et al., 2011, Dincer and Fredriksson, 2018). Lastly, U.S. state-level measures of corruption are relatively reliable and detailed, which enhances the reliability of our estimates. This constitutes a meaningful departure from the existing literature that has largely relied on the use of international measures of corruption that is often of questionable integrity (Emerson, 2006, Razafindrakoto and Roubaud, 2010).====Our results also fit into a sizable literature that explores the various causes of corruption within the U.S. For instance, Glaeser and Saks (2006) find that poorer and less educated states suffer from relatively high rates of corruption convictions. The spatial distribution of people also matters. Campante and Do (2014) find that isolated capital cities are associated with more corruption, more money in state politics, and worse public good provisions across states. They also provide evidence that newspapers are more likely to cover state politics when readers live nearby the state capital. Related to this work, Gao et al. (2020) find that the closure of newspapers in the United States is associated with higher state borrowing costs and government wages, both of which are possible symptoms of public corruption.==== We contribute to this literature by showing that large exogenous economic shocks, in the form of energy booms, also influence political corruption in the United States.====Our findings should also be considered in the context of a tangential literature that documents the severe consequences of corruption in the United States. As Ades and Di Tella (1999) write, “[i]t is difficult to overstate the economic and social significance of corruption”. Corruption in the U.S. has been linked to slow economic growth (Glaeser and Saks, 2006, Johnson et al., 2011),==== income inequality (Apergis et al., 2010, Dincer and Gunalp, 2012), lower state bond ratings (Depken and Lafountain, 2006), less spending on public higher education (Cordis, 2014), less stringent environmental policies (Grooms, 2015, Dincer and Fredriksson, 2018), and even less efficient commercial airports (Yan and Oum, 2014). Taken together, we conclude that oil—through its effect on political corruption—plays an indirect, critically important, and yet previously overlooked role in shaping public policy and economic outcomes in the United States.====The paper is organized as follows. We discuss theoretical mechanisms in Section 2, while in Sections 3 Data description, 4 Empirical strategy we present the data and the empirical design, respectively. Results and additional tests are given in Sections 5 Results, 6 Robustness checks, while in Section 7 we explore some of the practical implications of our findings.

However, this method may yield biased estimates for two reasons we examine in this paper: using Census data ignores the selection process of who votes, and relying on comparisons between aggregated units makes models susceptible to omitted variable bias. To assess bias, we use both ==== and a case study regarding a statewide environmental bond referendum for which we have collected aggregate data and individual exit poll data. Our results confirm the two sources of bias and show that aggregate model regression coefficients can be incorrect in magnitude and even sign. We conclude that using aggregate data will likely lead to incorrect assessment of valuation and distributional impacts of public good provision.","Direct democracy plays a critical role in shaping state laws and policies and setting the level of local public goods (Matsusaka 2005). In recent years, voters have judged ballot questions related to gay marriage, marijuana legalization, Medicaid, and gun rights, and have voted on bond and tax referendums worth billions of dollars for environmental protection, education, and infrastructure, among others.====Many papers have examined determinants of referendum outcomes using publicly available, aggregated votes to estimate voter preferences and valuation of public goods. Environmental applications are most common in areas such as land conservation (Deacon and Shapiro 1975; Kotchen and Powers 2006; Banzhaf et al., 2010), carbon mitigation (Holian and Kahn 2015; Anderson et al., 2019), river restoration (Deacon and Schläpfer 2010), and general environmental quality (Kahn and Matsusaka 1997; Burkhardt and Chan 2017). Additional topics studied include tax restrictions (Cutler et al., 1999), school finance (Brunner and Ross 2010), and Medicaid expansion (Matsa and Miller 2018), among others. Official individual vote choices are unavailable because of the right to cast a secret ballot, but official aggregated votes by precinct, town, or county are widely available. The method of these papers always involves matching aggregate votes to Census demographics at the same spatial scale, and then regressing aggregate vote approval on Census demographics. These descriptive regression results are interpreted as voter preferences by demographic group, and if cost is included in the model the results can estimate willingness to pay. Table A1 in the online appendix lists 49 known papers that follow this framework.====The purpose of this paper is methodological: do regression results using aggregate data yield unbiased estimates of voter preferences on specific referendums and valuation of public goods more generally? While authors in this literature sometimes acknowledge that aggregation bias could be an issue, they never dwell on it and always assume it is minimal.==== However, we find that aggregate model coefficients can be incorrect in magnitude and even sign, and can lead to incorrect assessment of valuation and distributional impacts of public good provision. We build on prior literature that has identified two sources of bias, but which have not been combined nor applied to a valuation setting. First, there may be omitted variables correlated with demographic characteristics and approval, and we focus particularly on spatially referenced omitted variables, which is an expression of ecological fallacy (Robinson 1950). People sort across neighborhoods, and people vote where they live, which means there are likely unobservable variables correlated with observable demographics and voter preferences, similar to findings in the housing market (Kuminoff et al., 2010). Because aggregate models rely entirely on spatial variation, or between-precinct variation, they are more susceptible to omitted spatial variable bias than models using individual data, which use both within- and between-precinct variation to estimate coefficients. The second source of bias is that aggregate Census population data mismeasure the voting population (McDonald and Popkin 2001). The choice to vote is a selection problem, and as a result voters are observably different than non-voters, with income, age, education, race, and ethnicity all correlated with who shows up to the polls (Leighley and Nagler 2013). Using Census population characteristics to proxy for the voting population ignores the selection problem and introduces systematic (non-random) measurement error in the independent variables.====We proceed on two fronts to understand the bias of estimating voter preferences using aggregate data. First, we develop a Monte Carlo simulation analysis that matches the salient structure of individual voting decisions and aggregated precinct records, and compare aggregate regression results to truth. Consistent with the problems identified above, the data generating process allows for selection in who votes, the presence of spatially omitted variables, and varying proportions of within-versus between-precinct variation in demographics. Unsurprisingly, spatial omitted variables cause bias; coefficients are downward (upward) biased when correlation is negative (positive). In terms of selection bias, when a group is disproportionately less likely to vote, the aggregate model regression coefficient for that group will be attenuated. If a group is more likely to vote, the coefficient will be amplified. When both sources of bias are present, the coefficient bias cannot be signed. In addition, we also model an exit poll that samples individual voters at a small subset of precincts. In every case, the exit poll outperforms the aggregate model because 1) it controls for voter selection by only including voters in the sample and 2) estimates coefficients using individual, within-precinct variation that mitigates or eliminates bias from spatial omitted variables. Further, unbiasedness holds even if participation in the exit poll is endogenous.====The second thrust of analysis is a case study of a statewide bond referendum for environmental spending that was held in Rhode Island in November 2016. We built precinct-level, aggregate data by matching precinct approval to socioeconomic information from the American Community Survey, which mirrors data construction in prior studies. Given the favorable performance of exit polls in the Monte Carlo analysis, we undertook an extensive exit poll that we use to benchmark the aggregate data regression results. We enlisted 80 undergraduate and graduate student volunteers who surveyed at 37 sample precinct locations and collected over 2000 surveys as voters left the polls. Simple means comparisons between the two datasets suggest significant differences between the voting and general population, particularly among education and income groups, and in directions mostly consistent with the findings of Leighley and Nagler (2013). For example, while 37.2% of Rhode Island's adult population has a high school degree or less education, only 13.3% of our exit poll sample was at that education level. In addition, we estimate a large degree of within-precinct variation in referendum approval and socioeconomic variables. On average, about 95% of variation is within-precinct, meaning that aggregate models are using only 5% of total variation to estimate coefficients.====We estimate identical models of voter preferences for the bond referendum using the aggregate data and the individual exit poll data, regressing referendum approval on presidential vote and socioeconomic characteristics (age, education, income, and race). We find large and statistically significant differences between the two models. Coefficients on presidential vote are substantially different: the aggregate model's coefficient on Voted for Clinton is 32% larger than the individual model, and the aggregate model rejects the individual model's point estimate with over 99% confidence. Further, coefficients on voting for third party candidates are different by an order of magnitude. Coefficients on socioeconomic characteristics from the two models can differ in magnitude, significance, and sign, and present different pictures of which types of voters support the referendum. For example, the aggregate model indicates that those with education levels of high school degree or less and college degree are most likely to support the referendum, whereas the individual model suggests it is those with a graduate degree that have the strongest support. We estimate additional models that support the two sources of bias being present in the aggregate model. First, we are able to find suggestive evidence of the presence of spatial omitted variable bias by including additional spatial controls and spatial fixed effects. Second, we develop a procedure with the exit poll data that simulates ignoring voter selection, and we find evidence that this induced mismeasurement can explain part of the discrepancy between the aggregate and individual voter preference estimates.====Lastly, in the spirit of Burkhardt and Chan (2017), we estimate willingness to pay (WTP) for the environmental referendum and the distribution of WTP across demographic groups. We find that estimated WTP is over 2.5 times larger using the aggregate model than the individual model. In terms of distributional impacts, sometimes the aggregate and individual results agree about which group wins and which loses, but the magnitudes of disparities can be substantially different. However, in the cases of educational attainment and race/ethnicity the models disagree about the direction of disparate impacts. While with different referendums or different states, the direction of bias may be different, these findings demonstrate that estimated valuation derived from aggregate voting data are likely to lead to incorrect inferences about overall benefits and the distributional impacts of a given policy or proposal.====This paper significantly advances the literature on empirical estimation of voter preferences and valuation through real-world referendum outcomes by demonstrating that aggregate data yield biased estimates and why. The underlying causes of the bias have been studied separately before. Issues regarding voter turnout and voter selection are well studied (Gerber and Green 2000; McDonald and Popkin 2001; Hajnal and Lewis 2003; Leighley and Nagler 2013; DellaVigna et al., 2016), though these papers do not examine preferences, only the decision to show up at the polls. Ecological fallacy or aggregation bias stemming from spatial omitted variables has been studied across many disciplines including political science, epidemiology, statistics, and economics (Robinson 1950; King, 2013; Firebaugh 1978; Piantadosi et al., 1988; Greenland and Morgenstern 1989; Gotway and Young 2002; Banzhaf et al., 2019).==== However, this is the first paper to recognize both of these issues as possible sources of bias when estimating voter valuation using aggregate data. The integration of concepts is critical because we find that the direction of bias cannot even be signed when both sources are present. Given the prevalence of these applications and the importance of understanding distributional impacts of policy, this is a critical methodological contribution.",Aggregate data yield biased estimates of voter preferences,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009506962100142X,8 December 2021,2021,Research Article,104.0

These results suggest that future planned increases in recycling may be frustrated by increases in incineration.","When the “Renewable Energy Facility” opened in June of 2015 in West Palm Beach, Florida, it marked the first time in over 20 years that a new solid waste incinerator began operations in the United States. Although 87 incinerators currently operate in the United States, lingering worries from the late 1980’s over dioxins and other airborne pollutants have led NIMBY groups and local politicians to oppose the construction of new incinerators in New York City, Baltimore, Seattle, and in many other places. New York City’s last incinerator closed in 1992, and since 1996 the percentage of all waste incinerated in the United States has decreased from 16% to 12% (U.S. EPA, 2018).====Over this same timeframe, incineration rates have increased in virtually all other developed countries.==== Across European OECD countries, the percentage of waste incinerated has increased from 14% in 1996 to 20% in 2019. This change has been led by Scandinavian countries such as Norway (from 15% to 49%), Finland (from 2% to 56%), and Estonia (from 0% to 48%), and by southern European countries such as Italy (from 5% to 21%) and Portugal (from less than 1% to 20%). Australia (11% to 30%) and South Korea (4% to 23%) have also increased their incineration rates over the past two decades, and Japan has sustained very high rates of incineration (79%).====Has this recent increase in incineration stifled or hindered the growth in recycling? Recycling rates increased rapidly across the developed world in the 1980s and 1990s, but recycling rates among the OECD’s top ten recycling countries in the year 2000, and thus the most mature programs at that time, have stagnated within the 30% to 35% range since (see Fig. 1). Perhaps scale efficiencies associated with the recent growth in incineration are one reason.====We are aware of no public policy plans suggesting that incineration has replaced or should replace recycling when managing solid waste.==== To the contrary, many developed countries have set ambitious goals to increase recycling rates with little attention paid to recent growth in incineration. For example, the European Union’s ‘Circular Economy Package’ establishes a goal of recycling 65% of municipal waste by 2030 even as incinerators continue to be constructed. Several states within the United States have set similarly ambitious recycling targets. Japan and many other countries have established goals around the three R’s (reduce, reuse and recycle), and incineration appears to play no role in this hierarchy. But perhaps incineration has been playing a role.====This paper uses original panel data representing Japanese municipalities to test whether excess incineration capacity explains recycling rates. Results suggest that, when controlling for other variables, municipalities with excess incineration capacity are estimated to recycle up to 3% less waste than municipalities without excess incineration capacity. This empirical link might help explain stagnant recycling rates in Japan and perhaps other developed countries that have recently increased incineration capacity. This empirical tradeoff might also make it difficult for countries to embrace simultaneous increases in incineration and recycling, thus frustrating the ability to satisfy ambitious recycling goals when incineration is on the rise.",Is incineration repressing recycling?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069621001364,4 December 2021,2021,Research Article,105.0

The results show that households that receive heat loss images reduce energy consumption by a larger amount than households that receive the traditional home energy report. Additionally, the heat loss treatment results in a higher rate of realized energy efficiency durables investment and leads households to conserve in a manner consistent with private and social efficiency: the most inefficient households exhibit the largest energy reductions and durables investment relative to the traditional social comparison. Overall, the results suggest that visual depictions of heat loss can help motivate energy savings.","Information programs aimed at affecting consumer decisions using insights from the behavioral sciences are used across many different domains, including personal finance, health, and education (Carroll et al., 2009, Johnson and Goldstein, 2003, Damgaard and Nielsen, 2018). The intent of these programs is to shape individual behavior in a manner considered to be welfare-improving from the perspective of both society and the individual. These “nudges” often take the form of selectively revealing information to individuals or conveying normative messages about peer behavior, and have been shown in some cases to exert a strong influence on individual behavior. However, while it is clear that nudges can motivate behavior, their effect sizes are often small and much remains to be learned about how to use nudges to promote welfare-improving behavioral change while also meeting public policy goals (Allcott and Kessler, 2019, Knittel and Stolper, 2019).====In this paper we show that insights from behavioral science can be used to magnify the energy savings of a widely deployed peer-comparison nudge through changes in the visualization of energy consumption together with personalized messaging. Our study is motivated in part by findings in the psychology literature that images can be better recalled and promote a stronger response than the same information presented in figures or text. The treatments we test are also motivated by the economics literature documenting that tailored information can improve decision-making (Hastings and Weinstein, 2008, Kling et al., 2012). In the energy setting, recent work by Boogen et al. (2020) finds that customized information about monetary savings from energy-using appliances and lightbulbs improves the adoption of energy efficient products. We test the effectiveness of heat loss visualization and tailored information in a randomized controlled trial focused on household energy efficiency. Our main finding is that visual presentation of heat loss information with a social comparison and personalized messaging elicits a considerably stronger response, as measured by energy consumption and energy-using durables investments, compared to figures with peer comparisons about energy consumption and personalized messaging. Given the widespread use of nudges to improve home energy efficiency, this finding has the potential to improve the performance of these programs.====Home Energy Reports (HERs) that motivate consumers to reduce energy consumption through normative feedback comparing a household’s energy usage to that of comparable households have become increasingly popular over the last decade. The most prominent example is Opower’s HERs, which are currently sent regularly to over 60 million customers at more than 100 utilities (Greentech Media, 2018, Oracle, 2019). These programs are seen by utilities and regulators as a cost-effective way to reduce energy consumption with few barriers to implementation, and a number of peer-reviewed studies have found that HERs are effective at modestly reducing energy consumption.====Early HERs rolled out by Opower between 2008 and 2010 lowered electricity consumption by about 2 percent for an average household (Allcott, 2011), and these reductions persisted for several years (Allcott and Rogers, 2014). On the other hand, Allcott (2015) found that utilities who were among the early adopters of Opower’s home energy reports had larger shares of high income and environmentalist consumers, such that evaluations performed using data from early-adopter utilities overstate future program efficacy in other customer populations. As a result, despite their popularity, the magnitude of savings from existing HER programs means they are not likely to make meaningful contributions towards meeting the ambitious greenhouse-gas reduction commitments made by several U.S. states, Canada, and the European Union.====Psychological theory suggests visual processing can improve both the salience of information and the motivation to take action (Zajonc, 1994, Epstein, 1994). Our treatment combines this insight with a novel aerial remote-sensing application that identifies house-level thermal envelope characteristics (Hay et al., 2011, Rahman et al., 2015). More specifically, we provide consumers with an infrared image of their house on their monthly utility bills. The infrared images are taken at night from a small aircraft in the heating season in a Canadian city with a cold climate, and capture heat loss from customers’ roofs and walls. The thermal images clearly illustrate sources of heat loss for each home, and are accompanied with a personalized heat loss score and messaging communicating each customer’s score in terms of heat loss.====Several studies have documented the role of imagery at invoking affective responses from our emotionally driven “experiential” cognitive processes rather than more rational systems of cognition, and that these responses are both effective at motivating action and predictive for the type of action undertaken (Slovic et al., 2002, Epstein, 1994). Affective reactions are emotional responses that occur automatically in response to a stimulus that captures a decision-maker’s attention, and subsequently guides information processing and judgment (Zajonc, 1994). This cognitive system of decision-making has been referred to as the “affect heuristic”, and images that trigger affective responses have been found in several settings to both predict and guide judgment, from stock purchases to adolescent behavior to raising awareness of environmental change (Slovic et al., 2002, MacGregor et al., 2000, Sheppard et al., 2011, Benthin et al., 1995). Framing effects may also interact with affective responses generated from infrared images of customers’ roofs (DellaVigna, 2009). Relative to traditional social comparisons, which focus messaging on energy consumption relative to peers, the treatment tested in this study instead communicates household consumption and the social comparison in terms of home heat loss, which is an approach to framing energy use that is likely unfamiliar to most customers. Because the treatment used in this study mixes visual presentation of information, heat loss framing, and personalized messaging, the experiment is not able to disentangle which element of the treatment causes households to respond, but instead measures the joint effect of different elements of the treatment.====For the study, we partnered with a municipally-owned natural gas and electricity distribution company in Medicine Hat, Alberta and MyHEAT, an Alberta-based firm that provided us with thermal imaging measurements for each household. Roughly 12,500 single-detached households from across the city were randomly selected to participate in the study, and randomly divided into two treatment groups and one control group of roughly equal sizes. One treated group, which we call the ‘traditional’ social comparison group, was shown a figure comparing their electricity and natural gas consumption to both average and energy efficient similar homes.====The second treatment group, which we call the heat loss social comparison or heat loss treatment, received a high-resolution infrared image of their roof indicating areas of heat loss, a thermal image-based heat loss score ranging from 1 to 10, and a comparison of their score to their average neighborhood score. Finally, like many conventional HERs, recipients from both treatments were provided with personalized information about their potential bill savings from energy efficiency improvements as well as tips for improving energy performance.====We evaluate these interventions using daily data on natural gas and electricity consumption for households in the control and both treatment groups. Our data covers the period from about one year prior to treatment to one year following initial treatment. Our analysis produces several findings. First, we find that the heat loss social comparison caused consumers to reduce natural gas consumption by about 0.8 percent on average, and statistically insignificant impacts on electricity consumption, whereas the traditional social comparison had statistically insignificant impacts on both natural gas and electricity consumption.==== However, we find substantial heterogeneity within each of the treatment groups. While there are either small or insignificant aggregate impacts of each treatment, across both groups low-efficiency/high consumption households respond by reducing electricity and natural gas consumption by more than 5 percent on average, while high efficiency/low consumption households respond by increasing usage by roughly 3 percent, a “boomerang” effect that has been documented in other studies (Knittel and Stolper, 2019, Byrne et al., 2018, Delmas et al., 2013).====Second, a key finding emerges when we account for household heterogeneity driven by pre-existing consumption levels. As noted above, for both treatments, households were informed how much they could save annually on their energy bills by improving their energy efficiency. These annual savings were personalized for each customer such that more inefficient or high consuming households were shown higher annual savings from undertaking energy saving measures. When we take into account the heterogeneity in potential savings, we find that while both treatments induced a statistically significant reduction of natural gas consumption per dollar of estimated savings, the effect of the heat loss social comparison was considerably larger. Aside from the most efficient households, who were informed of potential savings of zero dollars, the heat loss treatment reduced gas consumption by 8.1 percent per $100 of estimated annual savings, whereas the traditional social comparison reduced natural gas consumption by 1.3 percent per $100 of savings, about six times less than the heat loss treatment. Similar results are observed for electricity, though the savings magnitudes are smaller. Given that the annual cost of thermal imaging is about one dollar per home, we conclude that the thermal imaging treatment holds promise for cost-effectively magnifying the savings achieved from home energy reports.====Finally, by linking the household addresses to a database maintained by the provincial energy efficiency agency, we show that households that receive the heat loss treatment are more likely to participate in energy efficiency programs following treatment than either the control group or the households in the traditional home energy report group. These energy efficiency programs are targeted at improving the thermal integrity of the building shell. These results suggest that the intervention produced gains in energy efficiency and not just transient changes in behavior.====Recent work has identified promising strategies to increase the effectiveness of traditional nudge treatments using machine learning and welfare analysis (Allcott and Kessler, 2019, Knittel and Stolper, 2019). One set of findings from these studies has been that targeting treatment to high consumption homes improves consumer welfare and program effectiveness. Our work is complementary and focuses on identifying home envelope characteristics and communicating these to consumers. One advantage of our approach is that envelope metrics can offer consumers a less noisy signal, compared to consumption, on the benefits they can derive from investments that improve their home’s thermal envelope. This is consistent with our findings on higher rates of energy efficiency investment in the heat loss treatment group.====In addition to deploying a novel approach to magnifying HER savings, our paper also contributes to a growing literature that documents divergences between the predicted versus realized performance of low-carbon investments. In some instances predictions about the returns to residential energy efficiency or renewable energy investments have been found to overestimate returns, underestimate the pre-existing efficiency of homes, or, as in the case of solar financing, use metrics that imperfectly predict repayment performance, sometimes by a large margin (Levinson, 2016, Papineau, 2017, Fowlie et al., 2018, Davuluri et al., 2019). These findings point to the importance of developing strategies that accurately (and cost-effectively) predict home energy efficiency, to help target programs to the most inefficient homes and reduce the regressivity of energy efficiency and renewable energy subsidies (Allcott and Kessler, 2019, Drehobl and Ross, 2016, Allcott and Greenstone, 2012).====Our study utilizes what we term a hybrid engineering and realized consumption approach to make predictions about energy usage and bill reductions from improved building envelope energy efficiency. Our use of low-cost infrared technology to detect long wave thermal radiation mapped to individual homes allows us to identify residence-level heat loss and generate a simple metric to identify the most energy inefficient homes: a heat loss score ranging from 1 to 10. We link this residence-level heat loss score to customer consumption data to predict annual bill savings from a reduction in heat loss (or equivalently, an improvement in building envelope energy efficiency). As discussed later in the paper, we find a strong relationship between measured heat loss scores and annual pre-treatment household energy consumption. This suggests that a targeting strategy aimed at improving the efficiency of high-score homes is likely to further improve upon the realized returns from the myriad weatherization and demand-side management programs deployed by utilities and governments worldwide.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 begins with a brief literature review on the impact of HERs on natural gas consumption, provides a more detailed exposition of the psychological basis for using imagery to motivate energy conservation, then describes our experimental treatments that are the focus of this paper. Section 3 provides an assessment of the relationship between our measured heat loss ratings and realized energy consumption.

We find that weather above 32 °C is harmful to crop growth. Household-level analysis shows that each additional average harmful growing degree day (defined as temperature above 32 °C) leads to a 17.2%, 20.1%, and 20.0% increase in total land holdings, cropland, and cropland allocated to cereal production, respectively. Each additional average harmful growing degree day reduces households' forest by 24.7% for households with some forest in the baseline growing season. Further analysis shows that farmers' cropland expansion substitutes migration and off-farm employment. The significant impacts of weather shocks on cropland expansion are only significant for households with relatively fewer assets but not for households with more assets, which suggests that only households without enough resources would expand cropland. These findings highlight the need to identify and facilitate coping strategies that are sustainable in the long run.","Understanding agricultural producers' coping and adaptation strategies to weather shocks is important for better evaluating the impact of climate change on agricultural production and food security (Deschênes and Greenstone, 2007; Costinot et al., 2016; Janssens et al., 2020; Delacote et al., 2021; Gouel and Laborde, 2021). From a policy perspective, it's important to identify and facilitate coping and adaptation strategies that could not only mitigate the negative impacts of weather shocks on agricultural production but are also sustainable in terms of environmental and economic development. The well-documented cropland expansion and deforestation in tropical areas (Morton et al., 2006; Zaveri et al., 2020)==== and the finding that Peruvian farmers expand cropland in response to extreme heat (Aragón et al., 2021) indicate that farmers' coping strategies to weather shocks might have unintended consequences on environment in the long run. For example, do farmers expand cropland by converting their existing pasture, forest, fallow land, or converting previously uncultivated marginal land? If farmers expand cropland, do they use cropland expansion to substitute or complement other coping strategies, such as migration and off-farm employment? Furthermore, if cropland expansion substitutes migration and off-farm employment, do farmers prefer cropland expansion over migration/off-farm employment? Answers to these questions could help to identify and facilitate sustainable climate change adaptation strategies (Castells-Quintana et al., 2018).====Ethiopia, the fourth largest agriculture-producing country in sub-Saharan Africa in terms of agriculture value-added, presents an ideal setting to investigate farmers' cropland expansion and deforestation behavior in response to extreme heat. Ethiopia has a complex agricultural landscape, and 66.6% of its population work in agriculture in 2019 (World Bank, 2021).==== This article utilizes rich plot and household-level panel data in three growing seasons −2011/12, 2013/14, and 2015/16— from the Ethiopian Socioeconomic Survey (ESS) to investigate Ethiopian households' cropland expansion and land conversion behaviors in response to weather shocks. We first link temperature and rainfall data at the 0.05 by 0.05° spatial resolution (equivalent to 5.6 km squares at the Equator) with household and plot level data, and then use the household and plot-level fixed effects model to identify the impacts of weather shocks on households' cropland use and land conversion decisions.====We report several major findings. First, we find that temperature above 32 °C (°C) leads to a higher share of crop damage and lower crop production and value. We then use the threshold of 32 °C to construct harmful growing degree days. Second, we find evidence that extreme heat leads to cropland expansion and deforestation. Specifically, each additional average harmful growing degree day (defined as temperature above 32 °C) leads to a 17.2%, 20.1%, and 20.0% increase in total land holdings, cropland, and cropland allocated to cereal production, respectively. At the sample mean, the 17.2% increase in total land holdings is 0.132 ha and the 20.1% increase in cropland is 0.127 ha, indicating that farmers primarily expand their total land holdings for cropland but also converted some previously owned forest into cropland in response to harmful temperature. Each additional average harmful growing degree day decreases forest by 24.7% for households with some forest in the 2011/12 baseline growing season. Third, land conversion analysis shows significant evidence that households convert forest into cropland in response to extreme heat. Moreover, the cropland expansion is primarily driven by extreme heat during the sowing/planting season (April to June). Finally, we find that cropland expansion substitutes other mitigation strategies, including migration and off-farm employment. We find only households with fewer assets significantly expand cropland during extreme heat while households with more assets do not, suggesting that only households with limited resources would expand cropland to deal with the adverse agricultural productivity shocks induced by extreme weather. These findings highlight the need to identify and facilitate sustainable coping/adaptation strategies to weather shocks.====This article adds to two strands of literature. First and foremost, this article relates to the growing studies on households' coping strategies to weather shocks in developing countries. Current studies have identified various coping strategies, including double-cropping (Kawasaki, 2019), conservation technology adoption (Gebremariam and Tesfaye, 2018; Tambet and Stopnitzky, 2021), agricultural commercialization (Papaioannou and de Haas, 2017), farm management (Huang et al., 2015), consumption (Gao and Mills, 2018), and households' adult and child labor use (Beegle et al., 2006; Nagler and Naudé, 2017; Jessoe et al., 2018; Colmer, 2021; Marchetta et al., 2019). This article adds to this literature by providing evidence that cropland expansion is also one of the strategies (Aragón et al., 2021), and this coping strategy only exists for households that do not migrate and do not have off-farm jobs. Second, this article also relates to the literature that documents the global and national-level cropland expansion and deforestation (Morton et al., 2006; Zeng et al., 2018; Zaveri et al., 2020). It contributes to this literature by providing household-level evidence that links cropland expansion and deforestation patterns via farmers' behavioral responses to weather shocks. In particular, this article's finding that households expand cereal production and convert previously forest into cropland shows that farmers expand cropland at both intensive and extensive margins.====This article closely relates to Aragón et al. (2021) but is different in three important aspects. First, Aragón et al. (2021) only observe a household for a year and therefore utilize cross-sectional variation to identify the impacts of weather shocks. In contrast, in this article, we utilize a panel dataset and, therefore, within-household variation to identify the impacts of weather shocks on farmers' land use decisions. This data improvement could alleviate estimation bias arising from unobservable household characteristics. Another nontrivial difference is that the ESS provides plot-level information over time, which allows us to investigate farmers' land conversion behaviors. While the household-level land use data in Aragón et al. (2021) cannot determine whether the cropland expansion comes from forest or other land-use types. Finally, different from Aragón et al.’s (2021) finding that farmers engage in productive mitigation strategies irrespective of whether they can resort to other instruments to cope with extreme heat, we find that farmers' cropland expansion behavior substitutes migration and off-farm employment and only households with fewer assets expand cropland. This finding has important policy implications in that it shows that farmers with enough resources to adapt via other strategies would not cope via cropland expansion. Therefore, the provision of alternative mitigation strategies to farmers could potentially dampen the impact of climate change on the ecosystem in the long run.====The findings in this article have important policy implications. On the one hand, the finding that farmers primarily converted previously uncultivated land and some forest for crops indicates that cropland expansion strategy might negatively impact the environment and ecosystems in the long run. On the other hand, the finding that only households who do not have members migrating or having off-farm employment expand cropland and only households with relatively fewer assets expand cropland highlight the importance of providing farmers with alternative mitigation strategies to dampen the impact of climate change on the ecosystem.====The rest of the article proceeds as follows. Section two introduces the background of farming in Ethiopia and develops a simple framework to motivate the empirical analysis. Section three introduces data sources and lays out the empirical methods. Section four presents empirical results, followed by several robustness checks in section five.

While forest owners may employ several silvicultural practices to mitigate fire damage, the analytical study of optimal forest management has been reduced to the effects of fire on optimal rotation only. The fundamental result of this literature date back to the early 1980s and has remained virtually uncontested since then. This paper develops an infinite rotation cycle forest model in which landowners optimally choose rotation age, volume, and timing of partial harvesting in the presence of fire risk. We show that this setting fundamentally changes earlier results. In particular, more frequent fires imply beginning commercial thinning sooner but not necessarily shortening the rotation age. Two numerical applications highlight the empirical relevance of our findings.","Forest fires create economic losses to landowners but also have severe impacts on properties, human health, and public authorities' resources. Kent et al. (2003) estimated the costs of Colorado’s 2002 Hayman Fire at approximately $115.9 million. According to Butry et al. (2001), the large wildfires in northeastern Florida in the summer of 1998 caused a loss of at least $600 million. Costs of fire suppression by the U.S. Forest Service are also large and increasing, having doubled between 1991-2000 and 2001–2010, from an annual average of $580 million to $1.2 billion (Stein et al., 2013). On the U.S. West Coast the 2020 fire season was the worst ever recorded, with over 5 million acres destroyed==== and suppression costs of approximately $2 billion.==== While such figures are already impressive, they will probably worsen in the future. According to scientific evidence gathered in the latest IPCC Special Report (IPCC, 2019), climate change is likely to increase both the number and intensity of forest fires across the globe. This not only implies that fire frequency and intensity may increase in regions where it is already a major problem, but also that low-fire regions may become fire-prone (Jia et al., 2019; Loehman, 2020).====In this context, studying the economics of forest practices that mitigate fire damages becomes crucial. Agee and Skinner (2005) summarize a set of four principles for increasing forest fire resilience: (i) reducing surface fuels, (ii) increasing height distance between canopy and surface fuel, (iii) decreasing canopy density and (iv) favoring larger, fire-resistant tree species. Such principles can be implemented by applying various forest management operations, namely precommercial and commercial thinning or prescribed fire. The forest economics literature, however, is based mostly on the Faustmann model (Faustmann 1849) and has thus focused primarily on the effects of fire on optimal rotation only. Early papers by Martell (1980) and Routledge (1980) considered the problem of managing a forest stand under risk of destruction using discrete-time models. The seminal paper in this field is, however, by Reed (1984), which established the basic risk framework from which several other studies emerged and set the fundamental, long-lasting result in this literature. The study shows that when salvaged timber has no value, accounting for fire hazard is equivalent to adding a risk premium to the discount rate in the Faustmann rule. In the presence of fire risk, optimal management thus implies reducing forest rotation age.====This paper extends the infinite rotation cycle model and provides an analytical study of optimal forest management when landowners simultaneously choose rotation age, volume, and timing of commercial thinning in the presence of fire risk. Several papers have extended Reed (1984) framework to include nontimber benefits but have restricted forest management to clear-cuts.==== As a result, Reed (1984) original finding remained virtually unchallenged. More recently, Amacher et al. (2009) follow Englin et al. (2000) and study the analytical properties of the optimal solution for both stand age-dependent and age-independent hazard arrival rates. In both cases the authors show that accounting for the risk of fire leads to shorter rotation lengths relative to the Hartman solution. A second strand of literature, initiated by Stainback and Alavalapati (2004), investigated the impacts on optimal harvesting age resulting from the introduction of carbon sequestration benefits.==== Again, while the central insight provided by this body of work is that accounting for carbon sequestration tends to result in larger rotation lengths, these should still be reduced for higher fire risk levels.====The literature cited in the above paragraph does not consider landowners' option to engage in actions that mitigate fire probability and/or fire destruction. As a result, reducing forest stand exposure is only possible by reducing clear-cut age. Until now, only a limited number of studies in forest economics addressed that limitation, having focused primarily on fuel management strategies. Reed (1987) develops a model for determining the optimal level of expenditure on a protection action that reduces hazard rates. An optimal analytical condition is obtained assuming a fixed harvesting period, while the joint determination of both protection expenditure and optimal rotation age is obtained for a numerical example. More recently, Yoder (2004) modelled prescribed fire use in a Faustmann rotation framework. In this model, the landowner maximizes net present value by choosing when to perform fuel management but not rotation age. The most influential work in this research line is Amacher et al. (2005). The authors develop a stand-level model accounting for timber and nontimber benefits in which forest owners optimally decide plantation density, timing and intensity of fuel management treatment, and rotation age. In their study, fuel management does not reduce the probability of fire arrival but affects the volume of salvaged timber.==== In contrast with Reed (1984), the authors show through numerical simulations that optimal rotation age increases with fire risk. Daigneault, Miranda, and Sohngen (2010) introduce pre-commercial thinning in an optimal rotation model for a stand with timber and carbon sequestration benefits. As in Amacher et al. (2005), fuel management operations increase the volume of salvaged timber, but in this case, Reed's result (1984) still holds. When solving similar problems, many authors have stressed the relative complexity that is involved in analytically solving their models (Reed 1987; Reed and Apaloo, 1991; Thorsen and Helles, 1998; Amacher et al. 2005). This literature has, therefore, essentially relied on numerical simulations. As a result, the analytical properties of the optimal solution for a problem that explicitly takes into account actions that mitigate fire damages remain mostly unknown.====In addition to resorting to numerical simulation, that literature focused on pre-commercial thinning or prescribed burning, which may reduce damages resulting from fire but are costly activities. As a result, private forest owners are likely to engage in suboptimal levels of fuel management actions (Amacher et al. 2006). In this context, commercial thinning may provide a viable alternative for landowners, as it provides economic returns while at the same time may increase forest fire resilience (Jain et al. 2020). In fact, for some species commercial thinning accounts for almost half of total land value (Tahvonen et al. 2013). Also, thinning “from above” increases forest structural diversity and may foster biodiversity (Hagar et al. 2004). Despite its importance, the study of optimal thinning in the economic literature is scarce. In particular, economic analysis of commercial thinning in a risky context is almost non-existent. Reed and Apaloo (1991), in a rare exception, determined the thinning and clear-cut schedule of a stand subject to potential destruction by fire but under a single rotation framework. Their results resemble that of Reed (1984), suggesting that higher risk leads to the shortening optimal rotation length.====This paper addresses the challenges identified above by developing and providing a full analytical proof of an infinite rotation cycle forest model with commercial thinning under endogenous fire damage. We show that this setting fundamentally changes earlier results on optimal forest management in the context of fire. In particular, optimally decreasing stand exposure to increased fire risk implies beginning commercial thinning sooner but not necessarily reducing rotation age. In fact, when the fuel treatment effect resulting from commercial thinning is strong enough, and salvage price is sufficiently high, optimal management may result in partial harvest starting sooner and increasing the rotation length.====Clear-cut ages increasing with hazard rates have been previously reported in earlier studies (Amacher et al. 2005). To the best of our knowledge, however, the economic drivers producing the ambiguous effect of risk on optimal clear-cut age were not identified before. We contribute to that discussion by showing that when forest owners can engage in fire damage mitigation activities that generate timber revenues, it is not possible to determine the predominance of two counteracting effects. On the one hand, increased probability of stand destruction favors reductions in the rotation cycle. On the other hand, it decreases bare land value and reduces the opportunity cost of postponing clear-cut. Finally, the empirical implications of our analytical findings are investigated through numerical applications for two major commercial species in North America and the Nordic countries. In particular, we assess the magnitude of such effects under different scenarios, highlighting the role of commercial thinning in actual fire-adapted forest management.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce the model of a stand subject to risk of fire. Then, in Section 3 we develop and discuss the conditions for optimal thinning and clear-cut age. In Section 4 we extend the model to uneven-aged stands, and in Section 5 we apply the models developed in this paper to two tree species. Finally, in the last section, we summarize our main results and their implications to forestry practice.",Adapting to frequent fires: Optimal forest management revisited,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069621001194,6 November 2021,2021,Research Article,112.0

Researchers have extensively examined the climate implications of fuel switches from coal to natural gas (McJeon et al., 2014; Wilson and Staffell, 2018); however, the literature is limited in quantifying other aspects of such a shift. Lueken et al. (2016) find that U.S. coal plants switching to natural gas leads to substantial improvements in air pollution, which in turn translates into improvements in human health. In 2013, as part of a green energy transformation and low-carbon development path, China launched a pilot project to switch Beijing's power plants from coal to natural gas to cope with air pollution issues (Yang and Jackson, 2013). Widespread controversy followed—proponents argued that success in other countries demanded emulation, while opponents pointed to high natural gas prices and China's insufficient and unstable supply of natural gas (Cai and Li, 2014). The coal-to-gas switch, and the resultant improved air quality, may have significant economic benefits that offset natural gas price and supply problems. However, there are no explicit measurements of the impact of changes in environmental health risks associated with coal-to-gas switches. Our study begins addressing this question by turning to the housing market to examine the impact of improved environmental health in areas proximate to power plants where coal-to-gas conversion has taken place.====A vast amount of literature investigates the tradeoffs between price and health risks in the housing market. Previous literature posits that the locus of the tangent points of the offer function and bid curve reflects residents' willingness to pay for environmental amenities or willingness to accept for environmental disamenities (Rosen, 1974). Property values show significant negative effects from water pollution (Leggett and Bockstael, 2000; Tang et al., 2018), proximity to hazardous waste sites (Greenstone and Gallagher, 2008; Haninger et al., 2017), and air pollution (Bajari et al., 2012; Zheng et al., 2014; Qin et al., 2019). Two U.S. studies show that proximity to power plants also has a negative impact on housing prices (Davis, 2011; Farah et al., 2019). Davis (2011) finds that apartments located within two miles of power plants have 3%–7% lower prices than comparable houses in the United States, but does not consider variation in neighborhood air pollution related to fuel. Farah et al. (2019) examine the capitalization impacts of coal-to-gas conversion in power plants by examining the effects of coal-fired power plant closure, gas-fired power plant openings, and coal use-ratios of a dual-fired plant on housing prices across areas in the United States. They demonstrate that coal-fired power plant closure increases the prices of downwind properties within two miles by about 9%–26% and that a 1% year-over-year coal use decrease in a dual-fired plant raises the prices of downwind properties within 10 miles by 0.15%–1.3%. Our study differs from Farah et al. (2019) by offering a direct comparison between the effects of power plants before and after conversion. This dichotomous, rapid conversion is contextually important to China's situation because most coal-to-gas switches happened in a period of months, in contrast to the long and gradual transition of U.S. power plants with varying combinations of gas and coal fuel use.====To expand our understanding of the economic and environmental impact of coal-to-gas conversion of power plants, this study investigates how plant conversion affects property values and air quality in Beijing, China. We conduct a hedonic price analysis of coal-to-gas conversion using data on apartment-building-level housing transactions from 2011 to 2015, augmented with administrative data on all power generation plants and air quality in Beijing. Our dataset clearly defines four kinds of power plants: (====) coal fired over the whole study period (2011–2015); (====) gas fired over the whole study period; (====) new gas-fired plants that opened from 2011 to 2015; and, (====) plants fired by coal in the first few years of the study that were converted to gas-fired at some point during the study period. Hence, after dropping always gas-fired power plants (samples b and c), we categorize the data set into converted and non-converted power plants, which allows us to identify the source of variation between apartment buildings before and after coal-to-gas conversion.====In the application of hedonic framework, house buyers require full information about property attributes before property values can capitalize on residents' preference for gas (Tang et al., 2018). To the best of our knowledge, house buyers have information on potential air quality improvements due to fuel-use conversion, as it is available through community council bulletin boards, publicly available government websites, and information shared by real estate agents. China's government requires an environmental impact assessment (EIA) before a coal-to-gas project can begin, which includes public participation and provides a way for residents to be aware of this information. We also directly test the evidence and magnitude of the air quality improvements using monitoring data on nearby ambient particular matter (PM====), ozone, and sulfur dioxide levels due to the coal-to-gas conversion.====Based on the quasi-experiment of “coal-to-gas conversions for power plants in Beijing,” we first use the difference-in-differences (DID) approach that compares changes in housing prices between apartment buildings near converted and non-converted plants before and after the coal-to-gas conversion.<sup>1====</sup> DID is a commonly used econometric approach that identifies the causal relationship between two variables. DID is superior to other approaches at addressing omitted variable bias when the common trends assumption is satisfied (Currie et al., 2015; Haninger et al., 2017). A canonical DID estimator measures the difference between the change in outcomes before and after a treatment shock versus a control group. A growing literature employs this method to identify the average treatment effect on the treated (e.g., Dröes and Koster, 2016; Tang et al., 2018; Dobkin et al., 2018). However, one limitation of the DID method lies in the assumption that there are no other micro-level shocks in affected areas during exposure (Baez et al., 2017). Consequently, we employ a difference-in-difference-in-differences approach (triple difference, or DDD) to explore an additional dimension—within and outside of the buffer zone of 1500 m—which helps minimize the bias of time-varying shocks. The DDD estimator is equivalent to the difference between two difference-in-differences. DDD only requires that one parallel trend assumption be satisfied to have a causal interpretation rather than two parallel trends assumptions (Olden and Møen, 2020). Angrist and Pischke (2008) and Muehlenbachs et al. (2015) find that a DDD estimator is more defensible than the traditional DID estimator.====Our estimation results show that housing prices near converted power plants are 11% higher than those near non-converted plants. In other words, when compared with apartment buildings near non-converted power plants, the price of apartment buildings near converted power plants are, on average, 510 CNY higher per square meter. Our results are robust to different specifications and are supported by a falsification test using apartment buildings distant enough from the plant to be unaffected by the conversion. It is noteworthy that the effects are only marginally significant, especially post coal-to-gas conversion, in part due to our relatively small sample size. Improved air quality conditions near converted power plants, though surprisingly small, provide suggestive evidence for our findings of positive housing price premiums. Conversion to gas leads to about 4.9% PM==== reduction and 5.2% SO==== reduction.====Our study contributes to the existing literature in two ways. First, we provide the first empirical quantification of the positive and significant benefits for homeowners in developing countries when coal-fired power plants switch to natural gas. Second, the reduction of key air pollutants with similar magnitude likely explains our finding of housing price premiums; and thus, we provide an important benefit estimate for the necessity and effectiveness of coal-to-gas conversion policies. We also note that the price premium and air quality improvements we detect are fairly modest, unlike improvements detected in similar U.S. studies (Farah et al., 2019; Lueken et al., 2016), which suggests the importance of examining the impact of coal-to-gas conversion in developing countries directly instead of extrapolating from developed countries. It also highlights the need for China to undertake many more measures to combat air pollution problems.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the background of coal-to-gas policy for power plants in China. Section 3 describes the study area and data. Section 4 discusses the empirical strategy. Section 5 presents the estimation results. Section 6 illustrates the estimated effects of coal-to-gas on the ambient concentration of air pollutants. Section 7 summarizes.","Do homeowners benefit when coal-fired power plants switch to natural gas?

Among the various proposed causes of this pattern, those that have received the most attention are income ","Pollution exposure has repeatedly been found to be disproportionately experienced in low-income communities and communities of color. This observation is the foundation of the environmental justice (EJ) movement and a frequent subject of study in several social science and medical fields, including sociology, demography, geography, urban planning, public health, environmental studies, and economics.==== Research has documented a persistent statistical correlation between race, ethnicity, and/or income on the one hand and the siting of hazardous waste facilities on the other.==== Beyond just the siting of polluting facilities, ambient air quality itself has been linked to socioeconomic and demographic indicators.====Understanding the causes of disproportionate exposure in any given context is vital to the design of policy to address it; different causes suggest different solutions. A few potential causal mechanisms receive the lion’s share of attention in the academic literature. First, income inequality may cause lower-income people to “select” residential areas where environmental quality is lower. This willingness-to-pay based story (commonly referred to as “coming to the nuisance”) “continues to receive the most attention from economists interested in environmental justice questions” (Banzhaf, 2011). Second, direct discrimination on the part of firms or government, by race or other demographic factor, could produce inequities in pollution exposure — indeed, some use the term “environmental racism” interchangeably with environmental injustice (Mohai et al., 2009b). Third, firms could choose to locate in places where their costs (including labor, land, transportation, and regulatory compliance) are lowest (Wolverton, 2009), which may similarly be where the relatively lower income and/or minorities are more likely to live. This mechanism extends to encompass the case in which firms follow a “path of least resistance”, targeting communities with less political power on the grounds of cost minimization (Hamilton, 1995).====In this paper, we argue that existing research on disproportionate pollution exposure underweights the importance of another factor: information. There are many obstacles to accurate information about environmental quality and its benefits: companies and governments may have incentives to hide pollution, there are only so many pollution monitors, and our scientific understanding of health impacts continues to evolve. Missing and inaccurate information has the potential to affect housing choices, siting decisions of polluting enterprises, and government policy (like permitting, inspection, and enforcement) alike. We focus here on housing choice: if households sort into homes based on information about environmental amenities – or even just other attributes that are correlated with them – then missing or wrong information should be expected to affect the empirical distribution of pollution exposure.====Though the economics literature has documented widespread cases of limited information regarding environmental quality,==== there has been far less focus placed on the distributional and justice-related implications of this market failure. We provide exactly that focus: we investigate the relationship between environmental quality and income in a model of residential location choice that nests various forms of limited or missing information. The most closely related research is by Ma (2019), who shows that failing to model limited information biases willingness to pay estimates for pollution clean-up, and that in her application, minority and low-income homeowners place a high value on information about pollution. Also related is work by Bakkensen and Ma (2020), who model heterogeneity in preferences for flood risk in a setting of limited information and argue that improved information provision would be progressive.==== In contrast to these studies, we investigate how environmental inequities can arise from ==== limitations to perfect information – that is, when all individuals are equally wrong or uninformed – and focus on the example of air pollution and housing choice.====We begin by summarizing some of the many potential reasons why information about environmental quality could be limited or missing, as well as reasons to believe that households underestimate, rather than overestimate, air pollution and its damages. For instance, scientists frequently discover new biological pathways for adverse health impacts of pollutants. Companies sometimes hide emissions. Households are aware of some, but not all, known health impacts of pollutants, and they can experience psychological biases when understanding pollution impacts.====We then develop a model of the housing decision near a point source of pollution when air quality is not precisely known. Our aim in working with this model is to provide intuition for how information failures affect both physical pollution exposure and welfare across households, with a particular focus on how the impacts differ across income levels. We assume particular functional forms for utility and the pollution dissipation process, to show an intuitive comparative statics analysis with closed-form expressions. While the model focuses on the relationship between information failures and income-based sorting, we later discuss how the former may interact with racism and other drivers of disproportionate exposure.====Under a typical dispersion process for an air pollutant, and assuming people are under-informed about air pollution, we find that: (1) low-income households are exposed to more pollution; (2) low-income households are exposed to more ==== pollution; and (3) low-income households experience greater deadweight loss from a lack of information. While the first relationship is well-known, the latter two results are novel. It is noteworthy that, in our model, even ==== limited information can produce disproportionate pollution exposure and welfare loss for low-income households. This occurs because households sort according to known pollution, which is positively correlated with hidden pollution due to the way pollution dissipates.====We generalize the model by relaxing assumptions on the functional forms of utility and the price of air quality. In equilibrium, households sort into different air quality levels based on their willingness to pay for positively correlated amenities. We replicate the first two results from our more parametric model: low-income households are exposed to greater pollution exposure and also greater ==== pollution exposure. Our third result does not always generalize, although both the physical pollution dissipation process and declining marginal utility will work towards the third result holding.====We then discuss the implications and applications of our modeling exercises for empirical research and policymaking. We begin by highlighting conceptual implications, including the importance of accounting for imperfect information in estimation of willingness to pay. We then describe existing empirical work as well as offer descriptive empirical evidence of our own, that both corroborates our model findings and underscores the challenges of estimating the value of information. Next, we discuss policy implications, connecting our work to the current Biden Administration environmental policy agenda and noting the possibility that uniform information provision is distributionally progressive. Lastly, we show how other contexts may also be characterized by a uniform lack of information with disproportionate burdens on low-income communities and people of color.====Our findings build on a long literature in environmental justice (in economics, see, for instance, reviews by Banzhaf 2011, Banzhaf 2012, Hsiang et al. 2019, Banzhaf et al. 2019a, and Banzhaf et al. 2019b). Until recently, household sorting has been the primary mechanism for environmental disparities analyzed in the economics literature (Banzhaf and Walsh, 2008, Gamper-Rabindran and Timmins, 2011, Depro et al., 2015). However, the broader, multi-disciplinary literature highlights several other mechanisms, and empirical research in economics has begun supplying evidence of some of these. Lee (2017) examines the possibility that differential moving costs affect households’ ability to “flee the nuisance”. Timmins and Vissing (2017) argue that linguistic isolation affects bargaining power in mineral lease negotiations. Shertzer et al. (2016) show historical evidence that non-White neighborhoods in Chicago were more likely to be zoned for industrial uses. Christensen and Timmins (2018) examine discrimination in the real estate market that steers minorities towards more polluted areas. We add to this literature by providing theoretical and empirical evidence that implies unequal pollution and welfare loss from limited information.====Though our focus in this paper is on air pollution and housing choice, our primary finding emerges generically from the relationship between salient and hidden amenities. As such, we believe hidden disamenities have the potential to create income-based or racial disparities in other contexts where information is likely limited, such as climate change mitigation (Heal and Park, 2016), groundwater source selection (Kremer et al., 2011), and demand for environmental quality in developing countries more generally (Greenstone and Jack, 2015). Our findings also contribute to an active, cross-field literature on the economics of information (Hastings and Weinstein, 2008, Ehrlich, 2014, Kurlat and Stroebel, 2015, Allcott et al., 2019). That a disparity can be produced simply by information that is uniformly limited across individuals stands out in contrast with existing work that focuses on ==== in information and its costs.====In light of our findings, we argue that estimation of marginal willingness to pay for environmental quality (MWTP) – a primary concern in environmental and public economics – must account for informational failures. Much of the related literature has used an assumption of full information in analysis of revealed preferences. When limited information is mentioned, it is generally in the context of noting that estimated willingness to pay reflects ==== about environmental quality.==== We show that our motivating empirical examples can lead to biased estimates of willingness to pay, and that the bias can go in either direction. As such, we argue for the explicit incorporation of information about beliefs, along the lines of what is proposed by Bishop et al. (2020) and Ma (2019).","Inequality, information failures, and air pollution",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009506962100108X,9 October 2021,2021,Research Article,124.0

Using a triple difference-in-differences model, we find that, despite the seasonal decline in particulate matter pollution starting late March (concurrent with the lockdown period), the lockdown narrowed the disparity in air quality between census tracts with high and low shares of non-white population in rural New York, whereas the racial gap in air quality remained unchanged in urban New York.",", ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====), and that, because of pre-existing differences, the improvement in air quality in low-income and minority neighborhoods was different compared to neighborhoods with a majority white population. Given that even short-term exposure to pollution is associated with adverse outcomes in health (====), productivity (====, ====), cognitive ability (====), and longer-term health outcomes (====), the differential impacts of the pandemic on environmental conditions across neighborhoods have the potential to alter the economic and social disparities between relatively more and less privileged communities. The purpose of this paper is to document these (anticipated) disparities in air quality improvements in New York State during the pandemic and to highlight the environmental justice implications of the policy response to the pandemic.====We focus on fine particulate matter (PM====) pollution in New York State, an early epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. We analyze the change in PM==== pollution across the State as well as changes in the racial disparities in exposure to PM====). A related factor is that the effect of the federal economic impact payment (EIP) on mobility differed by household income. ==== shows that the median home dwell time of households with income less than $20,000 was not affected by the EIP whereas relatively higher income households increased their median dwell time by 3%–5% in response to the EIP.====Second, during the pandemic the Trump administration announced a temporary relaxation of several environmental regulations (====), and it is possible that regulated polluters increased toxic emissions subsequent to the announcement. A recent study by ==== shows that counties with more Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) facilities experienced larger increases in daily PM==== and ozone concentrations, while counties with fewer TRI facilities saw a smaller increase in pollution. Given the pre-existing disparities in the location of point source polluters, we expect this relaxation in environmental regulation and enforcement disproportionally affected disadvantaged neighborhoods, increasing the racial gaps in ambient air quality.====On the other hand, we also expect that racial disparities were narrowed due to the economic lockdown. Due to the disproportionate clustering of polluters in low-income and minority neighborhoods (====, ====), we expect a disproportionately larger improvement in air quality in disadvantaged neighborhoods as manufacturing slowed down thereby temporarily narrowing the racial gap in air quality.====We use daily air quality information on a fine spatial resolution from NASA’s satellite imagery data, aerosol optical depth (AOD), as well as monitor data from the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) network of ground PM==== monitors to estimate the overall causal effect of the COVID-19 lockdown on PM==== pollution. The PM==== monitor sample covers almost exclusively urban areas in New York State, separating itself from the AOD sample which mostly covers rural areas of the State. We utilize both the AOD sample and the PM==== monitor sample and interpret the difference between the two samples as the difference between urban versus rural areas.====We begin by summarizing the naive pre- and post-lockdown difference in PM==== pollution as well as the racial disparities in exposure using data between December 2, 2019, and May 24, 2020. We find that, consistent with previous reports, on average, PM==== pollution declined during the lockdown, regardless of whether we use the AOD measure or the direct concentration measure. As for the racial gap in exposure to PM====, we find it increased during the lockdown period in rural areas (AOD sample), but it is unclear whether the lockdown had any effect on the racial disparities in urban areas (monitor sample). However, additional analysis shows that these results cannot be explained by any of the expected channels through which the lockdown may affect PM==== concentration, including changes in human mobility, local economic activity and traffic volume, suggesting these effects might be due to reasons unrelated to the lockdown.====Using the previous 4 years data we detect a strong seasonal pattern in PM==== which declines annually in March–April, concurrent with the lockdown in New York State. Thus, to investigate causality between the economic lockdown and changes in air quality, we utilize historical data from past years and a triple difference-in-differences setting. We find that after accounting for the seasonality, on average, PM==== pollution declined in rural areas during the lockdown, though it remained unchanged in urban areas of New York State. But the evidence suggesting that the decline in rural PM==== is directly triggered by the lockdown is somewhat ambiguous. Nonetheless, we do find clear causal evidence that the lockdown policy decreased exposure to PM==== pollution among non-white census tracts and narrowed the gap between majority white and non-white census tracts in rural areas, though we do not detect any similar changes in urban areas. This suggests that although the economic lockdown only had a small effect on air quality in New York State as a whole, it significantly narrowed the racial gap in exposure to PM==== in rural areas. From the perspective of environmental justice, this (presumably) short-term and unintended consequence of the government response to the COVID-19 pandemic raises interesting questions about the nexus between environmental and economic inequities. It remains to be seen whether pollution levels and the associated racial disparities in exposure to PM==== return to pre-pandemic levels once policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic are withdrawn.====The following is the Supplementary material related to this article.

Achieving this target requires to reach net-zero CO==== emissions within the next 50–60 years ( IPCC, 2018). According to recent estimates, this implies global emissions to decline by approximately 7% per year in a typical 1.5 °C scenario and by 3% per year in a 2 °C scenario (e.g. Höhne et al., 2020). Such strong emission reductions are historically unprecedented and partially the result of the past decade of political failure in contrasting climate change. In the absence of more stringent climate policies, global emissions are bound to keep rising (e.g. Friedlingstein et al., 2019; UNEP, 2019).==== The current plans of expanding fossil fuel production will lead to emission levels in 2030 that are about 50% higher than those consistent with (median) cost-effective 2 °C mitigation pathways (e.g. SEI et al., 2019).==== There is clearly a sizable and growing discrepancy between global climate policy ambition and policy implementation.====The current delay in implementing climate policies in line with long-term policy goals will necessitate stronger future interventions, increasing the cost of the policies and magnifying the negative effects on key macroeconomic variables, as agents will have less time to adapt to the new policy framework. Moreover, a sudden and/or delayed introduction of strict climate policies, as well as technological breakthroughs in the low-carbon sector and changes in market sentiments or social norms could prompt an abrupt reassessment of the market value of carbon-related assets, threatening financial stability (NGFS, 2021). A large and unanticipated devaluation of these assets could precipitate a fire-sale of assets across the economy and could bring about procyclical market dynamics leading to a fall of investments and output, so amplifying the negative effects of the low-carbon transition.====The concerns around the risk of a disorderly transition have penetrated into policy circles and kicked off a debate on transition risk and on the implications for macroeconomic and financial stability.==== These concerns have also caught the attention of a growing number of central banks (CBs) around the world.==== The policy debate started with the speech of the former Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, to the insurance market Lloyd’s of London, warning against the financial risks of climate change and the new challenges for CBs (see Carney, 2015). Since then several initiatives have followed and in 2017 the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NFGS) was created, with the aim of enhancing the capacity of the financial system to manage climate-related risks and to reallocate financial resources toward green and low-carbon activities. Nevertheless, while there is a widely shared perception that climate-related risks can affect the conduct of monetary policy and that CBs could play a key role in addressing these risks, there is an increasingly heated discussion about what this role should exactly be (see e.g. NGFS, 2020a, NGFS, 2020b). Is the traditional CBs’ mandate with its set of instruments sufficient to effectively manage the transition toward a greener economy or is there a need to extend the mandate and design new green tools? Looking at the recent past and building on the experience of the global financial crisis, in the words used by Bolton et al. (2020, p. 9), “the sociopolitical pressure is already mounting to make central banks (perhaps again) the ====”, with the risk of overburdening their mandates and at the same time discouraging the market and other players from taking action. In this respect the cautious approach of CBs in taking up climate change risks is comprehensible.====This paper contributes to this debate addressing the following questions. To what extent and under which conditions can climate policy be a source of macroeconomic and financial instability? What is the impact of climate actions on CBs policies? What if CBs break with the long-held principle of ‘market neutrality’ and apply explicit climate change criteria to their asset purchase programs or when setting the macroprudential regulatory framework in which banks operate?====We build a New Keynesian (NK) model with financial intermediation and three sectors: a final goods sector and two heterogeneous energy production sectors (low-carbon energy and fossil energy). The economy includes sector-specific capital inputs and multiple assets in the banks’ portfolio, and embodies financial frictions arising from an agency problem limiting the ability of banks to obtain funds from households, in the spirit of Gertler and Karadi (2011). The NK features of the model, such as imperfect price adjustments, make monetary policy central to the dynamics of real activity and to the transmission of shocks. The modeling of different sectors allows us to analyze systemic and spillover effects arising from climate actions, and unexpected and sudden devaluations of fossil-related assets.====Financial market imperfections shape the conditions through which credit is granted, modify the propagation of mitigation policies, and enable the analysis of feedback loops between the financial system and the macroeconomy. The explicit modeling of differentiated assets, representing the final goods sector and the two sources of energy, allows us to explore the effectiveness of non-neutral large-scale asset purchase programs favoring green assets (the so-called green quantitative easing), and of fossil penalizing or green supporting macroprudential regulation. The model is estimated on Euro Area quarterly data for the period 1990Q1–2017Q4 using Bayesian techniques.====To explore under which conditions climate actions can be a source of macro-financial instability we consider an orderly and a disorderly transition scenario. In the orderly scenario a carbon tax is phased in gradually to reach a 24% cumulative emissions reduction in 10 years, consistently with the current mitigation targets set by the European Commission for the period 2020–2030 that achieve climate neutrality by 2050 (see EEA, 2021). To mimic a disorderly transition, instead, we consider a policy experiment where climate actions are delayed, implying sharper emissions reductions to reach the same mitigation target. Our results clearly show that a gradual mitigation pathway does not represent a threat to macro-financial stability, even under such ambitious climate targets. On the contrary, a delayed policy can entail higher output and welfare losses, enhance the instability of the financial system, and pose challenges to monetary policy, by increasing inflation volatility.====When we consider the possibility of an adverse financial shock hitting assets of the fossil energy sector, our findings show that green quantitative easing programs can stabilize financial markets and sustain aggregate demand. Their stabilizing properties, however, do not differ substantially from those of market neutral asset purchase programs. Moreover, due to the modest size of the low-carbon energy sector, stabilizing the economy exclusively through this channel, in case of major financial disruptions, would hardly be feasible.====Differentiated macroprudential capital requirements, designed to encourage the decarbonization of the banks’ balance sheets, can mitigate the impact of a negative financial shock originating in the fossil sector, but substantially protract the recovery phase by impeding a fast recovery. Differently from fossil penalizing schemes, capital requirements designed to favor the holding of green assets seem to have limited scope and, if too ambitious, can entail major output losses via the side effect on the recovery phase.====Overall our results suggest that CBs can facilitate a smooth transition, acting within the perimeter of their jurisdictions and consistently with their mandates. Even though there is room for new green instruments, their introduction and design should be carefully considered, balancing the relevant trade-offs.====Our paper contributes to an emerging literature that explores the role of environmental policies in the context of NK models. Notably, NK models have been widely used to inform CBs’ interventions and can also provide an important perspective in the discussion on the role that they may have in the fight against climate change.==== Early contributions exploring the relationship between monetary and climate policies are Annicchiarico and Di Dio, 2017, Annicchiarico and Diluiso, 2019, and Economides and Xepapadeas (2018). However, all these studies neither address the macro-financial implications of the transition to a low-carbon economy, nor the role of new green CBs’ instruments. A first contribution explicitly focusing on transition risk is provided by Spiganti and Comerford (2017), who study the impact of a disruptive climate policy in a model with financial frictions and discuss the effectiveness of different government’s measures in supporting a faster recovery. Punzi (2019) investigates the performance of different macroprudential policies to support green financing in the presence of macroeconomic shocks. A similar exercise can be found in Benmir and Roman (2020), who also consider the performance of macroprudential regulation and credit easing policies in response to different shocks in a model economy where the carbon tax is at its optimal level. Giovanardi et al. (2021) study the preferential treatment of green bonds in the CB’s collateral framework as a possible environmental policy instrument, while Ferrari and Nispi Landi (2021) explore the potential effects and the scope of a green quantitative easing policy, elucidating the conditions necessary for its effectiveness. Finally, Carattini et al. (2021) show how macroprudential regulation, in the form of taxes or subsidies on banks’ assets, can be optimally designed to limit the risk of recessions in the case of abrupt introduction of carbon taxes.====To the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive analysis of the role of CBs in addressing transition costs toward a greener economy and an assessment of the impact of the transition on price stability are still missing. Likewise, an analysis of the macroeconomic performance of non-neutral asset purchase programs and differentiated capital requirements in the face of a financial crisis, triggered by a devaluation of fossil-energy related assets, has not yet been done. This paper represents a first attempt to fill these gaps.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the model, Section 3 presents and discusses mitigation scenarios, while Section 4 analyzes the scope of quantitative easing policies and financial regulation in reaction to an adverse financial shock on fossil energy assets.

We find that a 1 percent increase in the probability of being sued reduces CO","Efficient policy design requires that regulators compare marginal costs from enacting an associated intervention with ==== its potential economic benefits; they include direct, and indirect or unintended effects. Indirect or unintended effects can often go the opposite direction of the intended effects and to such a degree that they eclipse the objectives of the policy (e.g., Almond et al., 2009). Alternatively, indirect or unintended effects can enhance the sought-after objectives (e.g., Freedman et al., 2018), and they might argue for even stringent policy measures. Such regulatory leakage and spillover problems from overlapping policies persist in many areas in the public policy debates.====Our paper focuses on spillovers in environmental policies across multiple pollutants. Fossil fuel generators produce local pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide (SO====), nitrogen oxides (NO====), and global pollutants such as carbon dioxide (CO====), but regulators often design separate policy instruments to target these pollutants. For example, in the 1970s, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) began using provisions of the Clean Air Act (CAA) to regulate SO==== and NO==== emissions from electricity generation and other sectors; regional regulations on CO==== only began recently since 2009 in the New England area under the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). These policies could either strengthen or weaken the effectiveness of one another — depending on the spillovers on other types of pollutants and ways in which the regulated companies choose to comply. For example, regulating SO==== emissions may decrease CO==== emissions if power plants choose to comply by switching to a cleaner fuel with a lower carbon content; by contrast, regulating SO==== emissions in the energy and manufacturing sectors could have a detrimental effect by increasing CO==== emissions if plants respond by installing more energy-intensive emission control equipment.====The impacts of climate policies on SO==== and NO==== emissions and on human health, have been well studied.==== However, only a few studies examine the spillover effects that go the other way around — how do regulations of local pollutants affect global greenhouse gas emissions? The answers from a few previous studies that have addressed this question are mixed. For example, Holland (2012) found that meeting the CAA standards ==== on CO==== emissions in California power plants, plausibly because most plants are gas-fired, while Raff and Walter (2019) found that by inducing usage of low-sulfur coal, meeting CAA standards on SO==== emissions ==== CO==== emissions for coal-fired plants. Brunel and Johnson (2017) found that CAA attainment status ==== on CO==== emissions in the manufacturing sector, likely because of a lack of effective margins to reduce carbon intensity, or because the substitution and spillover channels counteract each other.====Our paper studies how regulation on SO==== and NO==== emissions affects CO==== emissions from US power plants. We use a continuous difference-in-differences strategy that relies on a discrete-time duration model to account for the perceived treatment (threat) of regulation. We estimate a time-varying threat for different plants based on settlement data from environmental lawsuits, and estimate how the continuous threat of regulation affects emissions. This estimation strategy addresses the ambiguity of treatment that surfaces in many previous empirical studies, which relied on quasi-experimental methods such as difference-in-differences approaches (e.g., Bushnell and Wolfram, 2012, Brunel and Johnson, 2017, Raff and Walter, 2019). Under such approaches, it is not always clear on how to define treatment, and exposure to the treatment may vary across plants. Also, the perceived stringency of the policy can vary over time. For example, the interpretation and enforcement of a law can change from one administration to the next; the budget and time constraints to regulate can make the degree to which firms are targeted ambiguous – possibly leading researchers to draw incorrect policy conclusions from responses of an ill-defined or wrong “treatment group”.====In this paper, we study the New Source Review (NSR) program, a provision of the Clean Air Act that requires new and existing power-generating facilities to adopt emission control technologies to reduce SO==== and NO==== emissions. We examine how the likelihood of lawsuits for violating NSR regulations affects ==== emissions of local pollutants (SO====, NO====) ==== CO==== emissions from power plants in the US. Although the NSR was instituted in 1977, reforms did not take place until 1999 when the US Department of Justice (DOJ), representing the EPA, brought the first set of lawsuits to the US Supreme Court against 83 power-generating units at 24 power plants. Since then, this manner of enforcement has continued, leading to settlements involving 275 units from 85 plants between 1999 and 2015. The EPA has thus far won all NSR lawsuits that proceed to court – a record that has led power plants to attempt to reach the most favorable settlements possible. The basis of an NSR lawsuit depends on whether a plant has undergone a change that constitutes an unlawful action. Our empirical strategy thus takes into account the context surrounding the decision to bring a lawsuit — controversy around what constitutes an unlawful action, how the stringency of the policy changes over time, and how it varies across plants in different regions. Such ambiguities present a research challenge, which motivates us to find a way to observe not just the plants involved in a lawsuit but plants that are vulnerable to the threat of a lawsuit. We address this issue by estimating the probability of being named in an NSR lawsuit, which quantifies the continuous treatment of “being caught” for violations at each power plant; hereafter, we refer to this as the ====.====We build our discrete-time duration model on the cross-sectional probit model of NSR lawsuits used in Keohane et al. (2009). Our model allows us to predict the lawsuit probability and form a continuous treatment variable that is plausibly exogenous for our analyses on emissions and plant operations. This dynamic approach is important because we need to allow the NSR lawsuit probabilities to vary across plants and over time, and to correlate over time within a plant. To predict these probabilities, we use historical emissions and energy production information as in Keohane et al. (2009), other cross-sectional variation (such as the judicial circuit court in which a plant is located) and year fixed effects. The use of historical data is motivated by the legal arguments documented in lawsuit decrees against power plants: historical violations in 1980s and early 1990s were often cited as the reason why they were sued, even when the first legal notices were not served until much later.====Using the predicted NSR lawsuit probability, we proceed to estimate how the lawsuit threat affects both regulated and unregulated emissions from US power plants between 1995 and 2015. The effect of a higher lawsuit risk on CO==== emissions can be ambiguous. Installing and increasing the usage of SO==== and NO==== control technologies may increase a plant’s electricity consumption, and therefore increase CO==== emissions. Building new (usually more efficient and less CO==== intensive) boilers may not be appealing because doing so may trigger a long and undesirable review process to acquire New Source Review permits (Bushnell and Wolfram, 2012, Evans et al., 2008, Heutel, 2011, List et al., 2004). These types of distortions may limit the potential for CO==== emissions reduction, or may even increase CO==== emissions. Alternatively, a higher lawsuit risk may reduce CO==== emissions if a plant reallocates power generation from an older unit to a newer, more efficient unit (with a lower operating heat rate); or from a coal-fired unit to a gas-fired unit.====We find that a higher NSR lawsuit probability leads to a sizable and significant reduction on all SO====, NO====, and CO==== emissions. We control and instrument for gross electricity generation to separate the scale effect on emissions, and we include plant and year fixed effects in our regressions. We find that a 1 percent increase in the NSR lawsuit probability (an increase of about 0.2 of a standard deviation) decreases SO==== emissions by 0.9 percent, NO==== emissions by 0.9 percent, and CO==== emissions by 0.4 percent. These changes are equivalent to yearly reductions in SO==== emissions by 68 thousand metric tons, NO==== emissions by 34 thousand metric tons, and CO==== emissions by 6.9 million metric tons in 2007 — all of which are sizable compared with national emission inventories (EPA, 2016). Evaluating at a $42 per-metric-ton social cost of CO====, the climate co-benefits would be $290 million (in 2007 dollars), the size of which is comparable to the benefit of a $10/ton carbon tax, using results from Linn et al. (2014).==== The magnitude of CO==== co-benefits implies that it is important to account for climate spillover in computing total economic benefits of regulating pollution emissions from the energy sector. Our results also suggest that the NSR has been effective in reducing carbon emissions. Our results are robust to inclusion of other overlapping policies.====To investigate the factors that drive the emissions reductions, we further examine how a higher lawsuit probability induces plants to improve abatement technologies (the technology channel) and thermal efficiency (the efficiency channel). We find that a higher NSR lawsuit probability has led to significantly lower SO====, NO====, CO==== emission rates, and higher thermal efficiency (lower heat rate). However, for plants that stay open we find no improvement in heat rate. Our results suggest emissions reductions are coming from both improvements in the abatement technology and the shutdown of inefficient plants.====We decompose the counterfactual emissions reductions by plants with and without the natural gas capacity, along the intensive and the extensive margins. While both margins are important across all SO====, NO====, and CO==== emissions, the extensive margins contributes 61 percent of the CO==== co-benefits. Within the extensive margins, the majority of the reduction of the CO==== is due to the closure of coal-fired-only power plants. Closing or retiring these plants also accounts for the majority of SO==== and NO==== emissions reductions.====Since a plant may have multiple electricity generating units (EGUs), intensive improvements within a plant can be driven by improvements within a single EGU, or by a reallocation of resources across multiple units achieved by shutting down some units. We repeat our estimation and counterfactual exercises at the EGU level to distinguish between these two margins. We find that a 1 percent increase in the NSR lawsuit probability leads to a 1.2 percent reduction in SO==== emissions and a 0.8 percent reduction in NO==== emissions for operating EGUs; these results are similar to those at the plant level. However, a similar regression shows that the effect for CO==== emissions drops to 0.1 percent. These results suggest that the carbon co-benefits found at the plant level would mostly come from reallocation across EGUs. Also, we find that a higher NSR lawsuit risk reduces the probability of operating a coal-fired EGU, but increases this probability for gas-fired EGUs. Along those lines, we decompose our previous plant-level intensive margins (our counterfactual emissions reductions for plants that stay open) at the EGU level. We find that more than 95 percent of the CO==== co-benefits within an active plant are due to EGUs shutting down.====This paper contributes to the following strands of literature: First, this study contributes to the literature on regulatory spillover and overlapping policies as discussed above. Also, studying the sources of spillover offers important insights for a more effective carbon policy design; we quantify various channels that contribute effectively to CO==== emissions reduction, especially the extensive margin of the fuel switches at both plant and EGU levels.==== Our results also provide reassurance to policy makers that at the current equilibrium, a leakage to CO==== emissions will be unlikely from regulating SO==== and NO==== – or from strengthening existing regulations.====Also, this paper adds to the knowledge regarding how the NSR created vintage-differentiated regulations distortion (Stavins, 2005), and how this distortion affects SO==== and NO==== emissions. Past studies have found evidence of the delayed investment in new units, and investment reduction of new technologies in existing units (List et al., 2004, Heutel, 2011, Bushnell and Wolfram, 2012). Past studies have reached different conclusions about the sign and magnitude of environmental impacts (Evans et al., 2008, Keohane et al., 2009, Bushnell and Wolfram, 2012). Using a longer panel and a different estimation strategy, we provide evidence of effective emissions reductions of regulated pollutants, and we examine the channels that drive the emission reductions.====Lastly, this paper is also related to the literature on enforcement and compliance (see Harrington, 1988, Helland, 1998, Earnhart, 2004, Gray and Shimshack, 2011) in that we examine a case in which the degree of enforcement is difficult to measure; policies are uncertain; and no clear threshold of violation exists. We estimate the perceived stringency of enforcement by estimating the probability of being named in a lawsuit, and we use this to examine the effectiveness of enforcement.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives a background on the NSR program, and briefly describes our data sources. Section 3 presents our two-step approach in estimating the probability of being litigated, and how that probability affects emissions and plant operation. Section 4 presents the estimation results. Section 5 presents the decomposition exercises used to quantify plant-level and EGU-level intensive and extensive margins that explain our carbon co-benefits results. Section 6 presents additional evidence on emission control technology adoptions and within-plant fuel switches.

We study a largely unexplored relationship — the impact of natural resource wealth on criminal activity. Our empirical strategy exploits price fluctuations in 15 internationally traded minerals to study the impact of mineral wealth on local crime levels in South Africa — leveraging detailed data from 1084 police precincts over 10 years. In contrast to prior work, we find that increased mineral wealth leads to less crime. An exploration of mechanisms suggest that the effect is due to changes in employment opportunities created by the mining industry. Our results suggest that low international mineral prices can cause surges in crime. To investigate how resilience against such surges can be achieved, we study a government employment guarantee program and show that it was effective in reducing the crime response to international price fluctuations.","Natural resources are key drivers of economic activity in many developing countries and the role of these resources for economic, political and social outcomes is widely debated (van der Ploeg, 2011). A growing body of evidence links natural resource abundance to increased rent-seeking, adverse political selection, conflict and civil war.==== On the other hand, there is plenty of evidence of local wealth and welfare effects of natural resources (Cust and Poelhekke, 2015), and of mining in particular (Aragón and Rud, 2013, Aragón and Rud, 2016, Benshaul-Tolonen, 2018, Von der Goltz and Barnwal, 2019, Kotsadam and Tolonen, 2016, Mamo et al., 2019). However, not all welfare effects are unequivocally positive. In particular, bust periods may result is larger reductions in welfare than the booms initially generated (Cust and Poelhekke, 2015).====In this paper, we add to the existing literature by exploring the impact of natural resource wealth on another outcome of great importance for welfare in developing countries: criminal activity. This relationship has been widely discussed in the media, but has received less scholarly attention.==== This is despite the fact that crime is widely considered as a major obstacle to development (United Nations Office On Drugs And Crime, 2005, The World Bank, 2011). Surveys of citizens further highlight the concerns with criminality in many parts of the world — a study of 34 developing and emerging economies in 2014 showed that a median of 83% of respondents considered crime to be a “very big problem” (Pew Research Center, 2014). The effect of natural resource wealth on crime is theoretically ambiguous and will depend on how the returns from both legal and illegal activity is affected.====We investigate the relationship between natural resources and crime in the context of the mining industry in South Africa. We argue that this setting is particularly well suited to study the broader question. Minerals are important natural resources globally and play a dominant role in 81 countries that collectively account for nearly 70 percent of those in extreme poverty (The World Bank, 2014). South Africa is no exception and has the fifth largest mining industry in the world, contributing to around 8 percent of GDP (Chamber of Mines, 2014). In addition, crime is a serious threat to development in the country, similar to many other natural resource dependent countries such as Venezuela, Peru, Nigeria, Angola and Papua New Guinea.==== The size of the mining industry in South Africa and the wide range of minerals produced together with the high crime levels gives us plenty of variation to explore the causal effect of mining wealth on crime.====To estimate the effect of mining wealth on local crime, we exploit fluctuations in international mineral prices that we argue are exogenous to local production decisions. The idea is that production decisions are instead influenced by the exogenously determined possibility of profitably selling the minerals on the international market. This exogeneity assumption is supported by work arguing that international mineral prices are driven by demand rather than by supply factors (Slade, 1982, Álvarez and Skudelny, 2017, Stuermer, 2018). We carry out a number of different validity checks to ensure that this assumption indeed holds. In particular, we show that results are driven by minerals for which South Africa supplies a minor share (on average less than 1%) of total global exports. The benefit of this empirical strategy is that it allows us to address potential reverse causality (that criminal activity affect natural resource extraction) and omitted variable concerns (that other factors jointly determine local crime and resource extraction). Our data allows us to match 10 years of detailed crime data from 1084 police precincts with the geographical location of 210 mines collectively producing 15 different minerals.====We find that the total number of local crimes fall by approximately .7% when the value of mining production increase by 10%. These results are driven by reductions in property crime and we find no significant reduction in violent crime in our baseline specification. To better understand these results, we first study how mining activity change in response to price fluctuations. We document that the variation in international prices that we exploit are associated with a significant reduction in the probability that the mine will stop operating, but that mine openings are not affected. These findings are consistent with higher prices making mining more profitable – preventing some mines from closing down. Mine openings on the other hand typically require longer start-up processes and therefore do not respond to short term price fluctuations.====To explore the mechanism explaining the negative effect on criminality, we link local employment data to police precincts. We show that increases in mining value generates local employment opportunities (possibly both directly in the mining sectors and through industry linkages).==== These findings suggest that increased mining wealth affect the opportunity cost of engaging in crime (in line with Becker, 1968). Under the assumption that mining only affects crime through the employment margin, we can calculate employment–crime elasticities.==== These are 1.2 for the total number of crimes and 1.8 for property crimes. Hence, our finding speak to a large literature studying the relationship between labour market opportunities and crime.==== While a number of studies have documented this relationship for developed countries (Raphael and Winter-Ebmer, 2001, Gould et al., 2002, Fougère et al., 2009, Lin, 2008), there is much less evidence from developing countries — where crime levels are typically much higher (a recent exception is the work by Dix-Carneiro et al., 2018 on Brazil). We contribute to this literature by providing causal evidence in one of the most crime-ridden countries globally. Our estimates suggest crime–employment elasticities in this setting that are comparable to those in developed countries. The other key mechanism that could explain why an increase in natural resource wealth may reduce crime is that resource wealth improves the government’s crime prevention capacity. Governments in many countries around the world have put in place revenue sharing schemes that ensure the state benefits from natural resource booms. However, whether such resources are actually improving state capacity has been questioned (see e.g. Brollo et al., 2013). We test for this mechanism by studying whether interventions by the South Africa Police Service and policing expenditure are affected by local mining wealth. Both of these tests suggest that the observed reduction in crime we observe is not driven by increased crime prevention activities.====Our results imply that downward fluctuations in international mineral prices can cause surges in criminal activity in mineral producing countries, in line with previous findings that busts reduce local welfare (Cust and Poelhekke, 2015). To investigate how policy could prevent such surges, we explore the role of public employment insurance. Public insurance has the potential to protect individuals from income shocks experienced in response to price fluctuations and therefore prevent increases in criminal activity. As outlined in the 2014 World Development Report on “Risk and Opportunity”, developing countries are highly exposed to a range of risk factors, including both employment and price shocks. At the same time, government spending on public insurance tend to be limited. To study this issue, we exploit the roll-out of South Africa’s Community Work Programme (CWP). The CWP provides access to a minimum of two days of work per week to the unemployed. Hence, the program works as an insurance for those that may have lost their jobs due to contraction of the mining industry induced by price shocks. We document that the program reduces the sensitivity of crime (in particular property crime) to international mineral price shocks by between 3.5%–10%. In addition to providing insights into how crime can be decoupled from international price shocks, this analysis also provides further support that our main results are driven by changes in employment opportunities.====This paper relates to a large literature studying the impact of natural resource wealth on conflict (see, e.g., Caselli et al., 2015, Lei and Michaels, 2014, Maystadt et al., 2014, Rohner, 2006, Berman et al., 2017). The main argument in this literature is that an increased value of natural resources generates conflict by increasing the fight over these resources (the appropriation channel discussed above). Recent papers have also explored the links between extractive industries and violence at a sub-national level (see, e.g., Caselli et al., 2015, Lei and Michaels, 2014, Maystadt et al., 2014, Rohner, 2006). With respect to crime, Couttenier et al. (2017) find that minerals play a role both historically and presently for U.S. homicide rates, James and Smith (2017) find that both property and violent crimes increased in counties affected by the shale gas boom in the US and Buonanno et al. (2015) document a relationship between natural resource endowments and the emergence of the Sicilian mafia. With respect to mining, Bellows and Miguel (2009) show that diamond mining increased armed clashes during the civil war in Sierra Leone. The paper in this literature most similar in spirit to ours is Berman et al. (2017), who investigate the impact of mining on conflict in Africa from 1997 to 2010.==== The authors exploit within-mining area panel variation in violence due to changes in the world price of the relevant mineral and find that mining activity increases local area conflict, as measured by The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED) dataset. There are many potential reasons why the impact of natural resource wealth might be different for crime and conflict. One such potential explanation is that the appropriation mechanism emphasized in the conflict literature is weaker for crime. The resources of mining companies are typically well protected by private security forces, making it hard for individual criminals to appropriate them while larger groups might be able to coordinate successful attacks. To ensure that the difference in results is indeed driven by our focus on crime, we also collect data on conflict-related events in South Africa as recorded by ACLED. Using this outcome we find imprecisely estimated positive point estimates that are smaller but of a broadly similar magnitude to those reported by Berman et al. (2017) for all of Africa. This suggests that our results are indeed driven by our focus on individual criminal activity. Hence, we conclude that the effects of natural resources wealth is more complex than the previous literature suggests. When considering the overall welfare effects of natural resources, the impact on crime also needs to be taken into consideration.====The organization of the paper is as follows. Section 2 provides a background on the mining industry and crime in South Africa. Section 3 describes the data and the construction of the samples used in estimation. Section 4 describes the empirical strategies employed. The results from our main specifications, investigation of the underlying mechanisms and robustness checks are reported in Section 5.

Using synthetic control to construct the counterfactual outcome, this paper finds restructuring led to a 17 percent increase in capacity beyond the counterfactual in the seven years following restructuring. The overinvestment of the ==== is consistent with market coordination failure, contagion and low real interest rates, leading to an environmental welfare gain of $27.6 billion but overall net welfare loss of $18.85 billion.","A substantial theoretical literature identifies conditions under which entry into a newly-formed, or recently-liberalized, industry can generate a level of investment that is socially and privately excessive.==== Much of the inspiration for this literature comes from numerous historical episodes of investment boom and bust cycles which have followed efforts to liberalize markets. The most impactful are a series of banking and currency crises associated with policies of financial liberalization,==== with additional evidence of an association between removal of entry barriers or the introduction of new products and subsequent overinvestment (Klepper 1996; Berry and Waldfogel 1999). A similar removal of entry barriers occurred in the electricity industry in the mid-1990s and coincided with a significant expansion of gas-fired electricity capacity in the United States, henceforth referred to as the Gas Boom. Although it's been observed that there was a coincidence in timing between restructuring of electricity markets and the U.S. boom in gas-fired generation investment, no paper has demonstrated a causal connection between the two or estimated the magnitude of the investment effect (Bushnell et al., 2017). Leveraging the staggered nature of restructuring by U.S. states as an identification strategy, this paper shows restructuring itself led to a significant increase in capacity in restructured states.====This paper's findings contribute to both the literature that links entry deregulation and market liberalization to subsequent episodes of excessive entry and the literature on environmental impacts of electricity generation changes.==== The paper also sharpens our understanding of the U.S. Gas Boom from 2000 to 2005, where the industry invested over $180 billion in gas-fired electric generation capacity.==== Finally, this paper provides an original contribution to a lengthy restructuring literature which has attempted to estimate various welfare effects, including the efficiency of power plant operations (Fabrizio et al., 2007; Cicala forthcoming), wholesale market efficiency (Bushnell et al., 2008) and market power (Wolfram 1999).====The twin shocks to the U.S. electricity industry that provide the foundation for this paper are 1) starting in the mid-1990s, 21 states and DC restructured their electricity markets, and 2) over 183 GW (GW) of gas-fired capacity was added from 2000 to 2005. Each of these shocks significantly changed the industry. Restructuring moved the electricity industry from a system of state-regulated utilities that controlled the flow of electricity from the plant to the consumer to a system of competing plants and retail providers. The Gas Boom increased the share of gas-fired capacity in the U.S. from 24 to 42 percent (see Fig. 1).==== The staggered adoption of restructuring by states, together with cross-sectional variation in the Gas Boom, provides a setting which allows for identification of the causal impact of restructuring on power plant investment.====The thesis of this paper is restructuring caused a surge in gas-fired power plant investment by encouraging entry of firms without complete information. Once this new capacity came online and margins shrank, investment fell off sharply. It's not assumed, nor found, that restructuring caused long-term excessive entry of the type described in papers such as Mankiw and Whinston (1986). This paper uses the synthetic control method, which has yet to be applied to the electricity market literature, to estimate the impact of the policy change. The dependent variable in this study is the capacity ratio, defined in this paper as the ratio of generation capacity to electricity demand. Using state-level data from 1990 to 2017 and the synthetic control method to construct a counterfactual outcome for each restructured state, this paper shows restructuring increased the capacity ratio across restructured states, peaking at 17 percent above the counterfactual ratio (approximately 81 GW). The result holds in specifications that control for differences in electricity demand, gas and electricity prices, and capacity needs.====The investment associated with restructuring can be considered excessive in that it can't be explained by fundamental determinants of investment in electric generation capacity.==== Popular explanations, such as low natural gas prices, only serve to explain why these states built gas plants, not why they built 17 percent more capacity than their counterfactual outcome.==== The existence of lower capacity factors, a string of bankruptcies of firms that owned plants in restructured markets, record restructured state capacity ratios and large excess reserves nationwide for over a decade after the Boom, which is noted in Borenstein and Bushnell (2015), provide further support for these findings not simply being the result of factors like cross-state electricity transfers. It's also of note that EIA capacity forecasts, which are based on market fundamentals, significantly underestimated the amount of capacity added nationally throughout this period.====Excessive entry in electricity generation markets led to a net welfare loss of $18.85 billion. However, this net loss, which is only estimated for the excessive entry that occurred and not the total effect of the Gas Boom or restructuring, obscures component variation. The welfare loss from overinvesting in underutilized plants was $58.6 billion, but is partly negated by fuel savings of $12.17 billion and environmental savings of $27.6 billion. The environmental component, the result of efficient gas generation replacing inefficient gas and oil generation, is an important factor that is often overlooked due to the lack of effective emissions pricing in the U.S.====This paper identifies three explanations consistent with the facts of the period. First, firms suffered from coordination failure, as plants serving the same market came online in a short time span. Second, firms appear not to have followed a fundamentals investment strategy, suggesting a ‘contagion’ effect. Third, changes in the levelized cost of gas-fired plants may have encouraged overconfidence in manager's abilities to be the lowest cost producer, leading to excessive entry.====The paper is organized as follows.

Using a representative sample of Brazilian households, we specify and estimate a structural model of appliance choice and document that (i) the program only increases the valuations of households facing incentives in the form of an energy consumption quota introduced by the program; (ii) the effect of incentives dominates other components of the energy efficiency gap; (iii) the effect of the program on valuations is temporary, with these essentially reverting to prior levels after the end of the program; (iv) heterogeneity in valuations is prevalent; (v) focusing only on the purchase of new refrigerators, the counterfactual energy savings are non-trivial, being equivalent to the yearly electricity consumption of a city with 1.15 mn inhabitants. The findings suggest that short-lived reactions to temporary programs on the extensive margin are non-trivial and have log-run implications via the purchase of durables.","Consumers of energy-intensive products are expected to trade-off the purchase price against the lifetime operating costs of such products, since the latter often comprise a non-trivial share of household expenditures. In addition to consumers, this trade-off is also important for the environment, public policy and businesses: the choice of policy instrument(s) depends on how consumers address this trade-off and firms are expected to introduce products and set prices according to (expected) consumer behavior.====The study of this trade-off has become a central topic in energy demand since at least Hausman (1979). Since then, there has been enough evidence pointing to the undervaluation (or heavily discounting) of future energy costs by consumers, to the point that researchers coined the term Energy Paradox (Jaffe et al., 1999) to denote it.==== The frequent findings of undervaluation motivated a large literature on the ==== (EEG), the fact that consumers do not make apparently high-return energy efficiency investments. The literature has shed light on several explanations for the EEG, from market failures to behavioral anomalies to model or measurement errors (Sanstad et al., 2006, Gerarden et al., 2017).====This paper assesses effects of PERCEE,==== the program responsible for the largest reduction in electricity use among temporary savings programs worldwide (EIA, 2005). Specifically, we quantify the effect of the PERCEE policy measures – in particular, incentives – on the valuation of energy costs and on the EEG. PERCEE consisted of a package of measures enacted in order to induce households to reduce their electricity consumption by 20 percent at short notice. This was required due to a foreseen shortfall in electricity supply resulting from the alarmingly low levels of water reservoirs supplying the Brazilian hydro plants in early 2001.====Our study relies on a nationally representative survey of Brazilian households to examine three issues. First, we examine whether consumers correctly value the energy efficiency of appliances in the Brazilian market. Quantifying the EEG in the Brazilian market is a feature of interest in itself due to its being one of the largest emerging economies and the guidance such understanding arguably provides to other emerging economies. Understanding the path of energy consumption increases in emerging economies is a pressing issue (Gertler et al., 2016); while total energy consumption is expected to grow 18 percent in OECD countries, the corresponding figure is 90 percent in non-OECD ones for 2010–2040 (EIA, 2013).====Second, we assess the role of economic incentives during PERCEE on the EEG by comparing households facing a binding quota for their electricity use with those who were not constrained by it. By looking at the extensive (or long-run) margin (appliance replacement) of adjustment to this important shifter in energy demand, we complement the literature which looks mostly at the intensive (or short-run) margin of adjustment to policies (Reiss and White, 2005, Reiss and White, 2008) and subsidy programs of appliance purchase or replacement (Davis, 2010, Davis and Metcalf, 2016).====Third, we assess whether temporary programs can have a long-term effect in what concerns energy savings, the valuation of energy costs, and the reduction of the EEG.",Assessing the effects of a large temporary energy savings program: Evidence from a developing country,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069621000917,7 September 2021,2021,Research Article,131.0

Existing tariffs encourage the over-adoption of residential solar systems and the under-adoption of electric alternatives to fossil fuels. However, an efficient tariff based on fixed charges and ==== may harm low-income households. We propose an alternative methodology for setting fixed charges based on each household’s willingness to pay to consume electricity at marginal cost. Using household-level data from Colombia, we demonstrate the short-run and long-run distortions from the existing tariffs and how our new methodology could provide the economic, environmental, and health benefits from adopting clean energy technologies while still protecting low-income households from higher bills.","There is agreement among policymakers that a global transformation in how we produce and consume energy will be necessary to limit the risk of catastrophic climate change. This energy transition will require governments, firms, and households to convert energy sectors based on fossil fuels (transportation, heating, and industry) to use electricity. An increasing share of this electricity will be generated from renewable sources.====This paper studies a policy to encourage the energy transition for households in developing countries: electricity tariff reform. Incorporating developing country households will be essential for changing the world’s energy systems. Total final energy consumption in developing economies is projected to grow at 1.6 percent per annum between 2019 and 2040, compared to an annual decline of 0.2 percent projected for advanced economies over the same period (IEA, 2020). Stifling this demand growth would be misguided, given the core role that energy plays in economic development (Lipscomb et al., 2013). Moreover, improved energy access will enable households to mitigate the worst effects of climate change (Davis and Gertler, 2015, Barreca et al., 2016).====Under an efficient electricity tariff, the marginal price of consumption equals the marginal cost of production, including emissions costs. Such an electricity price encourages consumers to make more efficient decisions about their usage of energy services. More importantly, consumers will make more cost-effective choices of energy-using durable goods, including the fuel type (for example, choosing between an electric and a natural gas stove). These decisions can have long-lasting economic and environmental impacts because of the useful life of many durable goods (Davis and Kilian, 2011).====The problem with the existing electricity tariffs in virtually all jurisdictions is that the marginal price is too high. Most regulators set tariffs based on the average production cost, with the fixed costs of supplying electricity included in the per-unit price. Faced with these high electricity prices, consumers will make choices that are privately but not socially optimal. For example, they are likely to continue to choose cooking, transportation, and heating appliances that use fossil fuels, not electricity. Such choices will delay the transition to renewable energy. At the same time, high electricity prices encourage households to make investments to reduce their electricity purchases. These investments may represent a misallocation of resources that could otherwise support the energy transition. For example, residential solar installations may be privately but not socially optimal because the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) from utility-scale solar systems is significantly lower than the LCOE for rooftop systems (IRENA, 2021).====We study both the short-run and long-run distortions of the electricity tariffs in Colombia. The Colombian tariffs combine average cost pricing with a complex system of targeted subsidies and taxes. As a result, there is substantial variation across households in the marginal price of electricity, with some households paying prices three times higher than the marginal cost. We calculate an annual welfare loss of the short-run consumption distortions from these prices of more than US$80 million (Section 4). Using simulations of household-level adoption decisions, we compare the adoption of rooftop solar and electric stoves under the existing and efficient tariffs (Section 5). The current tariffs encourage the over-adoption of rooftop solar. At an installed solar system price of US$2500 per kilowatt, 12 percent of households would adopt rooftop solar systems under the existing tariff, compared to 3 percent under an efficient tariff.==== Conversely, the current tariffs discourage the adoption of clean electric stoves. For a stove price of US$200, less than 1 percent of households would switch from natural gas to an electric stove under the existing tariff, compared to 21 percent under an efficient tariff.====Our analysis of how electricity mispricing delays the transition to renewable energy sources is relevant to industrialized and developing countries. However, because of the higher growth of energy demand expected in developing countries, setting an efficient electricity price is likely to deliver greater economic and environmental benefits than in industrialized countries. As households in developing countries earn higher incomes, many buy energy-using durable goods for the first time (Gertler et al., 2016). Starting with a clean appliance portfolio will be simpler than retrofitting or replacing an existing portfolio. Moreover, many countries lack the infrastructure to distribute fossil fuels (for example, gasoline refueling stations and natural gas pipelines). Electrifying household energy consumption would allow governments to “leapfrog” the need to build some fossil fuel infrastructure (van Benthem, 2015). Finally, there are direct environmental and health benefits to households from electrification. Many developing country households rely on traditional or fossil fuels for energy services such as cooking, heating, and lighting. In 2017, 1.64 million deaths were attributed to household air pollution from solid fuels (GBD, 2018), more than the number of deaths from unsafe water and sanitation. Barron and Torero (2017) provide experimental evidence of the improvement in indoor air quality from electrification, showing a 66 percent decline in particulate matter and an improvement in child health for electrified households.====Although economists since Hotelling (1938) have described the principles of efficient public utility pricing, this policy is rarely discussed in the context of the household energy transition. IEA (2020) lists 24 types of energy policy adopted by countries in 2019 and 2020, mostly efficiency standards and clean technology subsidies. Only one policy (carbon pricing) is directly related to energy prices.==== High-income jurisdictions may have the institutional and fiscal capacity to correct their distorted energy prices using multiple layers of standards and subsidies. However, this is not the case for most developing countries. It is cheaper for governments to correct incentives by setting prices than by providing subsidies.====Although the potential economic and environmental benefits from electricity tariff reform are likely to be greatest in developing countries, there are also considerable challenges. Governments have long used utility tariffs to redistribute income. Most households in developing countries do not pay income tax, and (at least until the recent growth in conditional cash transfer programs) welfare payments to households are rare. In the case of Colombia, the neighborhood-level targeting of electricity tariffs has become deeply embedded in society. As a result, public utility tariff reforms are politically fraught. In many countries across the world, proposals to change electricity prices have incited riots and revolutions. An additional problem in developing countries is electricity theft through informal grid connections (Richter et al., 2020). Households with a low willingness to pay for electricity may prefer an informal connection instead of a formal connection with a fixed monthly charge.====We therefore study alternative electricity tariffs that provide efficient short-run and long-run incentives for households and also achieve the government’s distributional objectives. Meeting these distributional objectives will be necessary for the tariff reform to be politically feasible. For Colombia, we show that charging an identical efficient tariff to all households would benefit households in the highest income decile by an average of more than US$8 per month, relative to the existing tariffs. In contrast, households in the lowest decile would be worse off by more than US$2 per month (Section 6). This difference between the highest and lowest deciles is halved under a policy that sets the same variable charge for everyone but sets the fixed charge based on our estimate of the household’s willingness to pay for grid-supplied electricity at the marginal cost. Our results show that it is possible to transition to an efficient electricity tariff while still protecting low-income households from large increases in their bills.====This study contributes to the literature on the welfare distortions created by deviations from marginal cost pricing for public utility tariffs. Most of this literature focuses on short-run distortions in industrialized countries. Davis and Muehlegger (2010) show that residential natural gas consumers in the United States pay an average markup of 48 percent above private marginal cost, contributing to a deadweight loss of 3 percent of natural gas expenditure. Borenstein and Bushnell (2018) incorporate externalities into their analysis and show that for many parts of the United States, marginal electricity prices are close to social marginal cost. These previous studies focus on the short-run effect. Our analysis also considers the effect of price distortions on long-run electricity demand by calculating the incentives for households to invest in new technologies that will increase or decrease their electricity purchases.====The second contribution of our analysis is to the literature on the distributional effects of alternative tariff designs that reduce the distortions from non-marginal-cost pricing. Borenstein (2012) and Levinson and Silva (forthcoming) study the distributional implications of existing electricity tariffs in the United States. Borenstein and Davis (2012) show that moving to marginal cost pricing for natural gas, with cost recovery through fixed charges, would increase bills for two-thirds of households in the lowest income quintile. Burger et al. (2020) use data from an electric utility in Illinois to compare the effects of varying residential fixed charges based on demand, income, or geography, showing how this can mitigate much of the distributional effect of switching to marginal cost prices. Borenstein et al. (2021) study the retail rate design question for California, which has some of the highest residential electricity prices in the United States. They argue for income-based fixed charges or recovering these costs from state sales or income taxes. Income-based fixed charges are infeasible in a developing country context, where informal employment is common, and most workers do not pay taxes. Our study considers feasible alternative methods for varying the fixed charge based on the household’s willingness to pay for grid-supplied electricity at an efficient price, with a theoretical justification from Wolak (2018), and compares their effects using data from all electric utilities in Colombia. These methods can be implemented in both industrialized and developing country contexts without the need to obtain sensitive data from customers, such as their income, or increase state sales or income taxes.====Most importantly, the existing literature on the efficiency and distributional effects of alternative tariffs focuses on industrialized countries. As discussed above, our analysis of these issues in a developing country setting is especially relevant. Although we focus on Colombia, our results can be generalized to many other countries that have similar tariff structures (Komives et al., 2005). Finding a politically feasible approach to reform these tariffs and encourage the transition to renewable energy sources will provide substantial economic and environmental benefits.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

We find that prices of US$ 0.07 and US$ 0.10 per unit decreased the number of bags used by its customers in the range of 70%–85%. We also find that in anticipation of the price, customers increased the use of bags by up to 38% in some branches before its implementation. This result has strong implications for future studies, regarding the need to use long pre-periods. According to our data, short pre periods could bias upward the estimation of the effect of the prices by up to 41%. Finally, we do not find evidence consistent with the supermarket suffering a loss of sales, due to clients moving to stores not pricing the bags. The fact that the supermarket is a discount chain (clients are more price sensitive) and that it seems to have chosen the cities and towns in which it had more market share to rollout the prices, may inform policy makers about the conditions under which incomplete and moderate incentives may work.","Plastic bags can weigh only 3–5 g but carry several hundred times that weight. They are also relatively cheap to produce. Both characteristics made them the worldwide dominant choice for shopping. Nevertheless, improper disposal of used plastic bags causes significant negative impacts on the environment. For example, accumulated plastic debris in terrestrial ecosystems and open sea poses considerable risks to wildlife, which may suffer from choking, starvation, ingestion of micro-plastics and absorption of toxic chemicals (Barnes et al., 2009).==== In addition, the accumulation of plastic bags and debris in shores negatively affects economic activities such as tourism, shipping and fishing. A “significant underestimate” of the external costs of the pollution of marine environments with plastic is US$ 13 billion per year (UNEP, 2014). Awareness of these impacts have increased globally, according to the current number of initiatives to reduce the consumption of plastics bags around the world, at all government levels (see appendix section 10.1 for a review of these initiatives). Despite its impressive number, evaluations of the effectiveness of these initiatives with a proper identification strategy are rather scarce. This is particularly true for the impact of levies.====In this work, we evaluate the effect of different prices on the number of single-use plastic bags used by customers of a discount supermarket chain in Uruguay. To do so, we collect administrative data on the total number of these bags provided to customers at checkout, by month, in all the 90 branches that this chain has across the country, before and after it implemented a staggered rollout of the prices to different cities. The data covers 25 months, from April 2017 (a year before pricing the bags in the first branches) to April 2019 (a year after). To identify the effect of the prices, we use different strategies. We use three different identification strategies to identify the effect of a price of UY$ 2 (two Uruguayan pesos; around 7 cents of US dollar in April 2018, when it came into effect) and a price of UY$3 (approximately US$ 0.10): differences-in-differences OLS regressions, event studies, and synthetic control methods. To identify the effect of a UY$ 4 price, for which we do not have a control group, we use a simpler pre-post analysis.====We find that prices of UY$ 2 and UY$ 3 per bag decreased the demand of single-use plastic bags in the range of 70%–85%, with no clear difference between the two prices. Estimates are robust in magnitude and statistical significance to different methods of estimation, different specifications of the estimated equation and placebo tests. They are robust to the estimation of strategic anticipatory behavior by customers. We do not find evidence consistent with a loss in sales being the mechanism behind this drop. In addition, using a pre-post analysis, we find that the price of UY$ 4 produced sizable additional drop in the demand for plastic bags, in all branches, independently of the previous level of the price. We estimate that this price may have decreased the overall demand by an additional 40%, on average.====There are a considerable number of empirical studies on the effect of taxes or levies on the consumption of disposable single-use bags. Nevertheless, these largely rely on pre-post analyses or self-reported ordinal data on the use of bags (see the literature review section 10.2, in the appendix). We are aware of only two studies that use a causal inference technique and rely on observational cardinal data at the same time.==== Both of them were conducted in the US. Homonoff (2018) found that a tax of US$ 0.05 on paper and plastic bags in Montgomery County decreased their use by roughly 50%. Homonoff et al. (2020) found that a tax of US$ 0.07 in the city of Chicago had somewhat smaller effect in the first two months. Jakovcevic et al. (2014), to our knowledge the only study using a causal inference technique outside the US, collected observational ordinal data from supermarket customers in Buenos Aires, Argentina.==== They found that the charge increased the proportion of customers using reusable-bags during the first two months. Therefore, a basic contribution of our study is to provide the first estimation of the effect of a charge on the quantity demanded of single-use plastic bags outside the city of Chicago and Montgomery County that is based on a causal inference technique. This is an important contribution. Determinants of plastic bags consumption (income, preferences, relative prices and regulations) may differ between the US and less developed countries, which play a significant role in worldwide plastic pollution and where initiatives to reduce the use of single–use plastic bags are becoming ubiquitous. Assessing the external validity of results obtained in a limited number of US cities, informs about the effectiveness of a price when these factors vary.====In addition, the characteristics of our data allows us to contribute to the literature in other dimensions. First, our data is administrative, instead of observational, as the core data in the previous studies. This allows for a more exact estimate of the overall effect of the price. Second, the length of our pretreatment period gives us the possibility to estimate and disentangle the effect of the price from an anticipation effect. Customers may anticipate a charge simply because governments or stores inform them about it before the implementation date. For example, the city of Chicago announced the tax two months before its implementation (Homonoff et al., 2020). If customers behave strategically, they might increase the demand for costless bags ==== the implementation of the tax, to save money afterwards. Alternatively, they may buy reusable bags in advance. In such cases, estimations based on a short pre-treatment period may bias upward the estimated effect of the price. We find that the demand for plastic bags increased 10.6% during the four months before the implementation of the price in a city where the clients were informed about the price in advance, and 37.7% in two cities where this information could have leaked. We also find that using a pre and post treatment period of three months, as Homonoff (2018) and Homonoff et al. (2020) did, biases upward our estimates of the price effect by 28% in the first city and 41% the other two.====An important determinant of the choice set of plastic-bag consumers is the scope of the regulation. Incomplete regulation occurs when the regulation applies only to a subset of bags, stores, or jurisdictions. The pricing initiative in our study case is a private one. In every city but two where it voluntarily decided to price plastic bags, the supermarket was the only store pricing them. Therefore, we can characterize our case study as one of incomplete pricing. The problem with incomplete regulation is “leakage”. Homonoff et al. (2020) reports the introduction of thicker free bags in response to a ban on thin plastic bags. Taylor (2019) finds that sales of trash bags increased with a ban on single-use plastic bags. In our case, customers could have substituted the supermarket for other stores in the same city that were not pricing the bags. As far as we know, the empirical literature on plastic bags remains silent about the conditions under which incomplete pricing may still be effective. Our work contributes in this direction. Our unique setting and data allows us to compare the effect of the prices in the cities where the supermarket was the only one pricing the bags to the effect in the cities where it was not. Moreover, to test for leakage, we estimate the effect that the price had on the sales of a subsample of branches. By doing this, we are able to inform policy makers and non-governmental organizations on the effects of selectively targeting large, organized, easy-to-monitor actors when complete implementation is out of reach.==== This is important because the political, technical, fiscal and institutional factors behind the existence of incomplete regulation could be particularly binding in less developed countries. Moreover, one could argue that the presence of an informal sector makes incomplete regulation the only alternative in these countries.====Another important issue when estimating the effect of a price on the demand of disposable bags is that customers’ reaction to a price may vary through time. A possible reason for this is loss-aversion. Homonoff (2018) finds evidence consistent with this hypothesis. Since customer's reference price is zero, a (relatively small) tax would feel like a loss, explaining why customers react more to a tax than to a subsidy. Although there is not much evidence about how subjects determine their reference points (Kőszegi and Rabin, 2006), Tversky and Kahneman (1991) argue that these may be influenced by norms or social comparisons. Therefore, if paying for the bags becomes a norm or a sufficiently high proportion of the population starts using reusable bags after a period, the reference point may change, possibly decreasing the effect of a price on the use of plastic bags. Using scanner data from a large retail chain, Homonoff (2018) tracks the evolution of disposable bag use for up to 2.5 years in DC and six months in Montgomery County. However, this analysis only includes treated stores in the post-tax period. Homonoff et al. (2020) do observe customers on treated and control units up to one year after the tax. Unlike Homonoff (2018), they found that, a year after the tax, the proportion of customers using at least one disposable bag rebounds by roughly a quarter of the initial effect. Having data on the number of bags provided to customers at checkout, per month, in treated and control stores, for up to one year after the introduction of the price, allows us to contribute to this state of knowledge regarding the evolution of the demand for plastic bags during the first year of the implementation of a price.====Another issue that the literature has not solved yet is whether the magnitude of the bag price matters or not. Under incomplete information on the marginal private benefits of plastic bags, setting a price for plastic bags could result in undesired welfare losses. These may result from pollution damages from the excessive use of plastic bags (when the price is set too low) or from forgone benefits associated with shopping with single-use plastic bags (when the price is set too high). Knowing how consumers react to different prices gives policy makers valuable information in this respect. We contribute in this direction by estimating the effect of three different prices on the demand for single-use plastic bags. As discussed in more detail below, some caveats are in order with respect to this contribution. First, we have a relatively low number of observations for branches charging UY$ 3 per bag. Second, we are not able to disentangle the pre-post estimated additional effect of the UY$ 4 price with that of the complete/incomplete regulation.====We organize the paper as follows. In section 2, we describe the institutional context in which the intervention took place. In section 3, we describe the data. In section 4, we estimate the pooled effect of the prices. In section 5, we estimate wave-specific effects. In section 6, we study the differences in the effects of the different prices. In section 7, we present some robustness checks, namely the construction of synthetic controls, a quantification of anticipation effects and the effect on sales.

In a calibrated simulation, we find variation in these energy centrality concepts explains between 38 and 92% of variation in the rebound effect, which suggests input–output structure is a critical determinant of the aggregate effects of energy efficiency.","Many of the proposed benefits from higher energy productivity are predicated on the notion that investments in energy efficiency reduce energy use. At the aggregate level, whether or not this holds true is an open question with a wide range of candidate estimates. What explains the wide variation in estimates, and how do we reconcile the differences? In the ====, Owen offers a potential solution: ====To develop our argument, we begin by introducing a stylized general equilibrium model of the economy that embeds industrial, energy efficiency improvements within a disaggregated microeconomic production structure. The model combines elements from the energy efficiency literature (Chan and Gillingham, 2015, Lemoine, 2020) with workhorse models from the burgeoning literature on the macroeconomic implications of production networks (Acemoglu et al., 2012, Baqaee, 2018). In the presence of input–output linkages, we find industrial energy efficiency improvements, modeled as an exogenous productivity shock to a sector’s energy conversion technology, initiate a cascade of input reallocation across sectors as follows: The energy efficiency improvement lowers the marginal cost of production by reducing the energy service price for the sector experiencing the productivity shock. Under marginal cost pricing, a lower marginal cost is passed on as lower input prices to downstream industries in the network. Consequently, as the price shock propagates through downstream input–output linkages, the energy efficiency improvement spurs an expansionary process in these industries. If input substitution is sufficiently flexible, then producers can take advantage of lower priced intermediate inputs by substituting labor for these cheaper intermediates. As downstream industries expand their production, they also require more intermediate inputs from upstream industries. As downstream demand increases, upstream producers will absorb excess labor in the market and expand their own production to meet the intermediate requirements of downstream industries. We capture the richness of these interactions in our model.====To solve our model, we identify a mapping between an economy defined over the space of ==== inputs and an economy defined over the space of ==== inputs. This mapping links the energy services used for the production of intermediates with the physical energy resources embedded in those services. We achieve this by expressing the service-based input–output network as a modified goods-based input–output network. Using this equivalence, we are able to apply comparative statics directly to our equilibrium solutions using standard input–output techniques and recover the general equilibrium responses to changes in the network structure.====We introduce two new network centrality concepts: the ==== and ====. These centrality concepts summarize an industry’s implicit role as a producer or consumer of energy resources. Even if an industry does not directly supply inputs to the energy industry or consume energy intermediates, the industry may still be indirectly responsible for supplying inputs to or consuming from the energy sector in the presence of input–output linkages. Importantly, with input–output linkages, we find the energy efficiency shocks leads to a structural adjustment in the topology of the input–output network, and the extent to which the implicit upstream and downstream position of a sector adjusts following the energy efficiency shock depends on these energy centrality concepts. While equilibrium centrality concepts capture the capacity of a network to ==== a shock, the energy-centrality concepts allows us to characterize the capacity of a network to endogenously ==== to an energy efficiency shock. We introduce a novel analytical proposition that illustrates how idiosyncratic energy efficiency improvements alter the topological details of the economy’s input–output linkages and show how the energy efficiency shock changes the implicit position of a sector as a producer or consumer of embodied energy.====The “rebound effect” has interested economists since Jevons (1865) noted that, in a general equilibrium setting, adjustments in commodity and factor markets create behavioral responses that could entirely offset any potential energy savings from energy efficiency investments. Our main results show general equilibrium channels, namely, a price, scale, and multiplier effect, determine aggregate energy savings following an energy efficiency improvement. The price and scale effect account for the change in aggregate energy consumption spurred by economy-wide adjustments in factor and commodity prices. Yet, adjustments in market prices are only part of the general equilibrium rebound story. When sectors are linked within the economy’s input–output network, we identify a multiplier effect that operates independently of price movements in commodity and factor markets. This channel emerges because energy efficiency induces a structural shift in the industrial makeup of the economy, changing the way energy is used and produced in the economy.==== This result suggests energy efficiency improvements change the embodied energy in goods and services produced within the economy, resulting in a multiplier effect on partial equilibrium energy savings.====The existence of a multiplier effect in our model highlights the importance of input–output networks for both the theoretical and applied rebound effect literature. First, we show how the multiplier effect arises in general equilibrium solely through the existence of input–output linkages in the economy. As in standard, demand-driven input–output models, our multiplier effect emerges independently of factor and commodity price changes. In other words, our model suggests that the multiplier effect can amplify seemingly innocuous improvements in energy efficiency even in partial equilibrium settings. As a consequence, empirical analyses that abstract away from input–output linkages are likely to produce inaccurate rebound effect estimates, even in partial equilibrium settings.====Second, we highlight how variation in the topology of the input–output network can create variation in estimated general equilibrium rebound effects. Most estimates of the general equilibrium rebound effect are derived from numerical methods, and due to heterogeneity in modeling assumptions, areas of study, and industry characteristics, general equilibrium rebound estimates exhibit substantial variation, generally ranging from 50 to 100% (Stern, 2020).==== We show how variation in the network of input–output linkages is sufficient to describe variation in estimated rebound across computational general equilibrium (CGE) applications. Even if an analyst adopts a common model framework, with identical elasticities of substitution, and applies this framework to two similar economies, differences in the network of input–output linkages across the economies will generate variation in estimated rebound. Moreover, variation in estimates can also emerge from the same shock applied to different sectors within the same economy. We show this final result is purely based on supply chain relationships embedded in the economy’s input–output network and does not depend on the size or energy intensiveness of the sector experiencing the efficiency gain.====We complement our theoretical contributions by calibrating our model to input–output data collected for each US state. By incorporating input–output linkages into the model’s structure, we find that we can simultaneously untangle the mechanics underlying the general equilibrium rebound effect and offer new explanations for the variation in available numerical estimates. Using the calibrated model, we simulate general equilibrium rebound effects by iteratively applying energy efficiency shocks to each sector in every state. The results of this exercise show general equilibrium rebound effects tend to be higher than the partial equilibrium prediction but also exhibit substantial variation.==== We link variation in our estimates to assumptions regarding the elasticity of substitution and, more importantly, to variation in the topology of each state’s input–output network. Our results suggest variation in the topology of the economy’s input–output network explains between 38 to 92% of variation in our simulated rebound effects.====To introduce input–output networks, we build from a recent wave of empirical and theoretical research on the propagation of microeconomic shocks across input–output networks. Since the early contributions by Leontief (1936), Hirschman (1958) and Hulten (1978), many have argued the economy’s input–output network serves as a mechanism for the transmission and amplification of idiosyncratic, microeconomic shocks, e.g. Acemoglu et al., 2012, Acemoglu et al., 2016, Barrot and Sauvagnat, 2016, Atalay, 2017, Baqaee, 2018, Baqaee and Farhi, 2019, Boehm et al., 2019, Liu, 2019, King et al., 2019. In this paper, we extend this literature by studying the effects of energy-augmenting productivity shocks on aggregate energy use. Moreover, unlike these studies, we analyze the model from the perspective of a factor-augmenting productivity shock that only affects a sector’s energy input–output coefficient, as in Hogan and Jorgenson (1991).====Our model is closely related to Baqaee (2018), featuring non-unitary elasticities of substitution, multiple sectors, and input–output linkages. Since the early contribution of Saunders (1992), economists are aware that the magnitude of the general equilibrium rebound effect is sensitive to the choice of elasticity of substitution between energy and non-energy inputs to production. Subsequent theoretical contributions made this point clear through the lens of single-sector, neo-classical models (Saunders, 2008, Wei, 2010), where a substitution effect dictated by microeconomic elasticities of substitution determines the magnitude of the general equilibrium rebound effect.==== These models predict that, when inputs are gross substitutes, energy efficiency improvements cause aggregate energy use to increase (backfire), and vice versa. By incorporating non-unitary elasticities of substitution in our model, we find a similar result for the partial equilibrium effect. Moreover, we find the magnitude of the partial equilibrium effect is amplified by the presence of input–output linkages and we link the magnitude of amplification with the topology of the economy’s input–output network. These theoretical results are confirmed by our simulations.====Recent work by Hart (2018), Böhringer and Rivers (2018), an Lemoine (2020) extend the analytical literature to the case of multiple consumption goods. In terms of underlying mechanisms, these papers uncover additional channels through which economy-wide rebound effects arise. Using an expanding varieties model, Hart (2018) finds evidence that the substitution and scale effect have increased demand for energy-intensive goods. Böhringer and Rivers (2018) develop a model with two consumption goods and illustrate that general equilibrium rebound can arise through a substitution effect, scale effect, composition effect, and labor supply effect. Lemoine (2020) finds the same set of channels in addition to an energy supply effect in a model with multiple sectors and heterogeneous, non-unitary elasticities of substitution. Importantly, the energy supply effect emerges because the energy sector uses its own output as an input to production.==== Unlike these papers, in our model, a firm’s production technology not only uses labor and energy inputs, but also non-energy intermediate inputs. This key difference in modeling assumptions implies previous models are unable to account for how energy efficiency shocks propagate throughout the economy and change the underlying input–output structure of the production system. We show how this has important implications for rebound and the non-energy sectoral incidence of productivity shocks, since producer’s may indirectly supply inputs to or consume output from the energy sector.====The organization of the paper is as follows. Section 2 introduces the economic environment and highlights the key features of our model. Section 3 presents the equilibrium solutions to the model and link equilibrium prices and quantities with static network centrality concepts. Section 4 presents the main results of the paper. By applying comparative statics to the model’s equilibrium, we show how equilibrium aggregate energy savings from energy efficiency improvements are determined by the topology of the input–output network. Section 5 takes the model to data to evaluate the model’s predictions.

Bilateral carbon markets among the large emitters China, the EU and the US would not be Pareto improving. What is more, bilateral agreements with non-tradable emissions caps may be better suited to establish mutually beneficial cooperation in such cases. We conclude our analysis with a robustness check for different functional forms.","Economic theory suggests that the provision of a transboundary public good, such as a stable climate on Earth, increases when decisions are taken cooperatively by governments, since cooperation internalizes cross-border spillovers. As such, international negotiations hold the promise of making every participating party better off as compared to non-cooperation, but they are also prone to manipulation: a participating government might appoint a delegate with a certain well-known political agenda that is less ambitious than it would have been in the absence of cooperation. If this agenda can credibly signal that the delegate’s country has not much to gain from the negotiations, the other parties involved in the negotiations have to step up their contributions, which is beneficial for the considered country.==== In the case of climate change, this would imply sending a less “green” delegate to the negotiations.==== As all countries face the same incentives, they are likely to end up in a prisoners’ dilemma, and it is unclear whether negotiations are still beneficial for every party. If they are not, there are strong incentives to withdraw from the agreement at a later point, or to not enter the negotiations at all.====In the literature, the mechanism described above is referred to as “strategic delegation” or “strategic voting”, depending on who selects the delegate, i.e., whether the principal on whose behalf the negotiations are conducted is an institution such as the government or the electorate (the median voter, to be more specific). In this paper, we investigate how the combination of cooperation and strategic delegation affects the prospects of establishing a particular type of international environmental agreement (IEA), namely an international emissions permit market. Such markets have been proposed as one potential instrument for the efficient reduction of GHG emissions (Flachsland et al., 2009, Jaffe et al., 2009, Green et al., 2014). The obvious gain from such markets is the equalization of marginal abatement costs across firms and countries, which is a necessary condition for efficiency (Montgomery, 1972). This efficiency gain is higher the more marginal abatement costs diverge across countries in the absence of trading. At the same time, these markets necessarily involve a transfer payment from one country to the other (unless countries have the same marginal abatement costs before trading permits), and hence countries negotiating an international carbon market have an interest in either increasing or decreasing this transfer. This feature adds another strategic dimension to the negotiations.====We model the hierarchical structure of delegation and cooperation as follows. At the first stage of the game, the principals of two countries play a Nash game by simultaneously selecting an agent each from the continuum of available agents in their economies. We find that they have an incentive to appoint agents that care less about environmental damages than they do themselves — a result that is well known in the strategic voting and strategic delegation literature and is due to the strategic substitutability of policies (Segendorff, 1998, Siqueira, 2003, Buchholz et al., 2005, Graziosi, 2009, Loeper, 2017, Habla and Winkler, 2018). In particular, the principal that suffers less from higher aggregate emissions has very strong incentives to misrepresent her preferences by selecting a delegate who puts little or even no weight on climate damages. By doing so, the principal credibly commits to a less ambitious climate policy, passing on the burden of abatement to the other principal. In the second stage, the appointed agents negotiate on the total number of emission allowances and their distribution. If they fail to agree, they set up domestic policies (either domestic permit markets or a domestic tax).==== We model the negotiations using the Nash Bargaining Solution. The negotiated policies are jointly efficient from the appointed agents’ point-of-view. In the final stage, emission permits are traded, either on domestic markets or on an international market, depending on whether the negotiations were successful.====The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, we show – for benefit and cost functions typically assumed in the literature on international environmental agreements – that cooperation in combination with strategic delegation leads to lower aggregate emissions than a non-cooperative regime. That is, the costs of strategic delegation do not offset the benefits of cooperation in terms of aggregate emissions. From an environmental perspective, this is good news.====Second, despite lower aggregate emissions and thus lower individual damages, we find that cooperation in the form of an international permit market may not be a Pareto improvement for the principals of the negotiating countries (governments or median voters); rather, cooperation may be detrimental to one of the principals relative to a non-cooperative regime. This is due to the strategic delegation incentives that the principals face, and due to the corresponding transfers, which may be quite high. We identify four cases for which negotiations about an international carbon market are mutually beneficial for the principals of two countries, whereby: (i) the principals’ marginal damage costs are identical and marginal abatement costs (for given abatement levels) are sufficiently similar; (ii) countries are identical in terms of marginal abatement costs (for given abatement levels) ==== marginal damages as perceived by the principals are either sufficiently similar or sufficiently dissimilar; (iii) countries are identical or very similar in terms of marginal abatement costs (for given abatement levels) ==== marginal damages; iv) the principals’ marginal damage costs are sufficiently different. Our results imply that, in contrast to what one would expect, strongly diverging marginal abatement costs across countries (for given abatement levels), which yield high efficiency gains under permit trading, are not sufficient for the principals to establish an international permit market through Coasean cooperation in the presence of strategic delegation. We also show that bilateral trade among the big emitters EU, US and China, does not constitute a Pareto improvement, as they are very similar along one dimension (marginal damages) but not sufficiently similar with respect to the other dimension (marginal abatement costs).====Third, negotiating an IEA without transfers, i.e., an agreement with ==== emissions permits is – for empirically relevant combinations of marginal benefits and marginal costs – a more promising way to establish mutually beneficial cooperation and achieve emissions reductions than negotiating an agreement with tradable caps. The reason for this result is that the possibility of receiving a transfer under an international permit market is being exploited by the principals, as they tend to strategically appoint even less green agents than in the absence of transfers. A high transfer and high aggregate emissions due to this behavior eventually make it unattractive for one principal to cooperate via an international permit market. This is less likely to happen when transfers between countries are not possible.==== Among the EU, the US and China, bilateral agreements with non-tradable emissions would indeed be Pareto-improving.====Our analysis deviates from previous papers in the strategic delegation and strategic voting literature in an important aspect. While it is conceivable that for traditional public goods the costs of provision are linear and the benefits are concave, the opposite is true in the case of the climate as a public good: the costs of providing this good are convex and the benefits from this good are (approximately) linear (we justify this assumption in Section 3 but also explore the implications of other functional forms in Section 8). This change in the curvature of cost and benefit functions induces an important difference. With linear costs, the country that is more efficient at providing the public good will produce all of it and is compensated for its efforts by the other country in the Nash Bargaining Solution. In the case of climate change, however, it is arguably never optimal that one country provides all of the public good, i.e., abates all emissions it has. In this context, we show that asymmetries between countries in terms of marginal costs and marginal benefits do matter for the success of an agreement (and not only the curvature of the demand function for the public good, as found by Loeper, 2017). Moreover, assuming a quadratic abatement cost function guarantees that even for symmetric countries, there exists an equilibrium in which both agents have a positive valuation for the environment, with total emissions limited to no-policy emissions. This result is in sharp contrast with Buchholz et al. (2005) who find that with perfect transboundary environmental spillovers, both principals choose agents with a zero valuation for environmental damages, resulting in aggregate emissions soaring to plus infinity. All of these aspects show that the analysis of international agreements in the context of climate policy may substantially differ from and lead to other conclusions than analyses of more traditional transboundary public goods problems.",The political economy of negotiating international carbon markets,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069621000863,26 August 2021,2021,Research Article,135.0

The greatest CO==== emissions with a carbon tax policy with CO==== reductions with a feebate policy.,"To limit drastic climate change and its devastating consequences, it is necessary to implement appropriate and optimal policy instruments in core economic sectors to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at a global scale. No international transport activity today faces any meaningful tax on the CO==== it emits. This has at least three adverse consequences for the shipping sector, which are the main concerns of this study. The ==== is a higher than optimal activity in international shipping (types of vessels and their technologies, their travel routes and distances, travel time, and the amounts and types of goods being transported). The ==== is too high consumption of fuels per ton-nautical mile and fuels with high carbon content, causing CO==== emissions that are too high. The ==== is the missed opportunity of raising fiscal revenues from international shipping, a critical problem for many low-income countries with low tax revenue collection (see Keen et al. (2013) for further arguments).====Today, the shares of global CO==== emissions due to international aviation and shipping are about 2.5% each. For the transport of international goods, sea transport dominates. According to Cristea et al. (2013), in 2004, 51% of CO==== emissions from international trade resulted from sea freight, 27% from air freight, and 22% from land (road and rail) transport. While people-oriented transport represents 85% of the aviation sector's revenues (although a lower share of ton-km), 90% of the revenues of international sea transport come from goods transport. In the Appendix, we describe stylized facts of the maritime sector in more detail.====This study aims to contribute to improving understanding of how and by how much CO==== emissions from maritime transport can be reduced by implementing a carbon tax. As far as we know, this is the first theoretical and econometric study to analyze the impacts of changes in bunker fuel prices, which proxy carbon taxation, on global international trade and global CO==== emissions resulting from this trade. We use a comprehensive panel dataset for products at the 6-digit HS level of aggregation covering the years 2004–2017.==== UNCTAD (2009) indicates that fuel costs account for 50%–60% of total ship operating costs depending on the type of ship and service (see also Gohari et al. (2018)). Since carbon taxes are not today in place, we use changes in the bunker price to simulate the effects of a possible carbon tax in the maritime sector.====This work also seeks to provide guidance to the international community regarding how to attribute responsibility per country/region and traded product type to their shares in global CO==== emissions in the maritime sector, and how carbon taxation could affect CO==== emissions. We estimate CO==== emissions levels from maritime transport of products at the 6-digit HS level of aggregation.====This study considers all possible worldwide country pairs, except landlocked countries, that trade the heaviest products (at the 6-digit HS level of aggregation). These products make up more than 75% of the total weight of internationally traded goods transported by sea. This paper focuses on three main topics. ====, we theoretically and empirically analyze the impact of changes in bunker prices on trade (intensive margin) and carbon emissions. ====, we make carbon emission projections for 2030 and 2050 as a result of: i) a one-time implementation of a carbon tax of US$ 40, and ii) gradual increases (step-up) in carbon tax levels every 5 years toward 2050. The latter approach represents a scheme for gradually phasing out fossil fuel vessels from 2040 toward zero-emission vessels (ZEVs)==== in response to a continuous increase in the carbon tax up to 2050. This carbon price policy might lead to the sufficient phase-out of fossil fuels by 2050 to reach the target pledged by the IMO for 2050 by providing the necessary incentives to switch to more efficient vessels and zero-carbon fuels, as well as funding for R&D into new zero-emissions technologies.====, we study how a feebate policy (similar to Parry et al. (2021)) could affect international trade and carbon emissions, and how it compares to a carbon tax policy with respect to the magnitude of carbon emissions reductions.====There are three main alternatives for implementing a carbon price for goods transport: i) carbon taxation (a given tax per unit of CO==== emissions); ii) cap-and-trade schemes for trading rights to emit carbon at a (positive) carbon price established in the carbon market; and iii) a feebate scheme, as introduced by Parry et al. (2021), which is based on carbon taxation but redistributes the potential tax revenue via “benchmark” rebates.====In the first two policies, the carbon price represents the marginal cost of carbon emissions related to bunker fuel consumption by the maritime sector. Under carbon taxation, substantial revenues can be raised, some of which can be transferred to the poorest and most remote countries with high and increased trade costs (which could lead to less product variety of imports and exports and lower traded quantities), and/or to support purposes related to global climate finance. Offset or other cap-and-trade schemes are less likely to raise similar revenues considering the experience of the European Union's cap-and-trade program, which has had overly generous allocations of emissions allowances to regulated entities.====Note also that a stable and increasing carbon tax represents a better signal for green investments in more fuel-efficient and more technologically advanced ship types than a cap-and-trade scheme, where the carbon price can be much more volatile and unpredictable. It is important to emphasize that an efficient strategy to implement a carbon tax on bunker fuel requires this tax to be universal and applied worldwide to avoid free-riding problems and carbon leakage (Elliott et al. (2010); Parry et al. (2021)).====In our study, we consider carbon taxation, but our results and conclusions hold if carbon pricing was implemented through a cap-and-trade or offset scheme (given a positive and reasonably stable global carbon price for international transport fuels), instead of through a carbon tax. Furthermore, note that our analysis elucidates how carbon emissions can gradually be reduced when imposing a carbon tax on bunker fuels. The crucial issue we consider is how to immediately contribute to reducing the current high GHG emissions rate toward long-run sustainable levels.====GHG emissions from international transport have recently become a central issue of interest for various reasons. More countries and other international stakeholders are increasingly recognizing the adverse consequences mentioned above. The International Maritime Organization (IMO), a United Nations organ, regulates the international maritime sector. In April 2018, the IMO pledged to reduce GHG emissions from international shipping to half the 2008 level (1135 million tons) by 2050 (see IMO (2018a); UNCTAD (2018), section 5B). The Fourth IMO GHG Study (IMO (2020)) projects that without carbon pricing, and depending on future economic and energy scenarios and certain vessel efficiency improvements, maritime emissions will likely be between 90% and 130% of the 2008 emissions by 2050.====In Section 2 we present the theoretical model. Section 3 describes the data, econometric model, and results of the effect of a carbon tax on international seaborne trade. Section 4 outlines the estimations of the potential reductions in CO==== emissions that could result from implementing carbon taxation to international maritime transport, an analysis of a stepping-up plan for reaching the IMO emissions target by 2050, and calculations on the possible financial resources that can be obtained from carbon taxation at the international level. Section 5 presents a feebate policy and projections of the effect of this policy on CO==== emissions. Section 6 summarizes and concludes the paper, and presents policy recommendations.

Floods not only represent a significant share of current damages from natural disasters—accounting for more damage than wildfires, tornadoes, and earthquakes combined—but also are intensifying in many places due to various factors including the increased frequency and severity of storms and heavy rainfall events, as well as sea-level rise in coastal settings (Marsooli et al., 2019, Neumann et al., 2015, Prein et al., 2017, Strauss et al., 2016). When flood waters recede, homeowners are often left with significant amounts of damage. According to an annual survey by the Federal Reserve, most homeowners in the U.S. have very low levels of liquid savings—amounts that would be insufficient for covering post-disaster rebuilding (Federal Reserve Board of Governors, 2020). Federal disaster aid—contrary to popular opinion—is quite limited and not consistently available.==== While access to credit is helpful in financing recovery for some, it is often limited for many low- and moderate-income households (Collier and Ellis, 2020). As such, insurance is typically necessary for households to fully recover financially from disasters. Indeed, a growing body of evidence finds that those with insurance recover faster than those without insurance (Kousky, 2019). Having funds for repair and rebuilding is linked to positive outcomes in terms of emotional well-being, mental health, educational attainment, and the stability of families (McKnight, 2020).====Insurance is thus foundational to recovery, and yet many households at risk of flooding do not have insurance to cover damage from these events. For instance, only about 20% of households flooded in New York City during Hurricane Sandy had flood insurance at the time of landfall in 2012; a similar share of homes in the greater Houston area had flood insurance when Hurricane Harvey hit in 2017 (City of New York, 2013, Yu, 2017). Damage due to flooding is not usually covered under standard property insurance contracts. Since it was first introduced in the late 1960s, the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), housed within the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), has been the primary provider of flood insurance in the U.S., underwriting over 5 million residential policies annually. Recent estimates suggest this represents around 90 to 95% of all residential flood contracts written in the U.S. (Kousky et al., 2018). Data that we use in this paper on the universe of NFIP insurance contracts indicate that only 3.9% of all housing units in the continental U.S. had an active flood insurance policy in 2019, despite the underpricing of many classes of policies. There is a clear flood insurance gap in the U.S., where many households who are exposed to flood risk do not have coverage.====This paper has two primary objectives. First, considering the important role of flood insurance in ensuring many households’ financial well-being, this paper seeks to provide a holistic examination of those factors associated with demand for flood insurance. In so doing, we aim to provide a better understanding of the entire market for flood insurance: previous work examining flood insurance in the U.S. has focused almost exclusively on those areas that FEMA has designated as at highest risk of flooding. By extending this work to focus on the entire market for flood insurance under the NFIP, we are able to provide a more exhaustive set of findings which have important implications for policymakers, shedding light on those attributes of communities characterized by particularly high or low take-up of insurance. Second, this paper aims to better understand households’ willingness-to-pay for insurance and the degree of asymmetrically used information in the market for flood insurance. Asymmetrical use of information describes a setting in which homeowners and insurers alike have access to information on relevant buyer attributes, but insurers do not use this information in setting prices.==== The presence of asymmetrically used information has important implications: a specific first-order concern is that since the NFIP uses broad flood zones to set premiums instead of more granular, up-to-date measures of flood risk, the pool of insured households may be adversely selected. If the NFIP is indeed adversely selected, this has important implications for the likely impacts of pricing reforms.====Since the early 1970s, there has been a federal requirement that high risk households in a FEMA-mapped 100-year floodplain—areas with a 1% or greater probability of experiencing a flood each year—with a federally-backed loan or a loan from a federally-regulated lender purchase flood insurance for the life of the loan. Despite the presence of this requirement, take-up of insurance in areas subject to the mandatory purchase requirement remains relatively low: we estimate that the nationwide share of households in 100-year floodplains purchasing insurance was 48.3% in 2019. When not mandated to have flood insurance—such as those without a qualifying loan or outside the 100-year floodplain—purchases of flood insurance are even more infrequent: we estimate that the nationwide take-up rate outside 100-year floodplains, for example, was 2.2% in 2019.====Flooding is not limited to the 100-year floodplain (also called the Special Flood Hazard Area or SFHA) despite the seemingly low demand for insurance in these areas. Understanding flood insurance demand in these lower risk areas where purchases are voluntary is therefore critical for consideration of households’ financial recovery from flooding events. Using our data of flood claims between 1978 and 2019, we find that almost a third of all claims are from outside SFHAs. Many recent storms, including Hurricanes Katrina, Ike, Sandy, and Harvey, all led to flooding that extended outside of SFHAs. Beyond just catastrophic events that exceed the 1% annual inundation probability, FEMA SFHAs often do not capture rainfall-related flood risk and this risk is increasing in many places around the country, often outside of SFHAs. Recent modeling accounting for unmapped inland flood risk finds that there are 2.6–3.1 times more households in a 100-year floodplain than suggested by the SFHA designation on FEMA maps (Wing et al., 2018).====Ensuring households’ financial resilience to increasing flood risk—including both rainfall flooding and catastrophic events, both of which impact areas outside SFHAs—requires a better understanding of what drives voluntary purchases of flood insurance in these areas where there is no purchase requirement. Surprisingly, there are pockets around the country where a non-trivial number of households purchase flood insurance outside of the SFHA. For example, in the state of Texas, around 70% of the NFIP policies are not in SFHAs and are thus voluntarily purchased. This does not imply that take-up rates outside of SFHAs are high, as there may simply be more households outside of SFHAs. That said, non-SFHA policies represent an important subset of those written under the NFIP. Fig. 1 shows the share of all policies-in-force (PIF) and the total value of claim payments for which non-SFHA policies account over the previous decade. As Fig. 1 demonstrates—despite low take-up outside SFHAs—these policies represent a large and growing share of overall NFIP policies-in-force, and have accounted for over 60% of the value of total claim payments in certain recent years. Clearly the voluntary segment of the NFIP is non-trivial and plays an important role in the market for flood insurance in the US. Despite the importance of these policies, the determinants of these voluntary purchases are largely unaddressed in the literature to date.====While prior research has examined demand for flood insurance, these papers are unable to separately examine take-up rates in and outside SFHAs and are often unable to distinguish the impacts of the mandatory purchase requirement from drivers of voluntary demand. Nonetheless, these studies find that take-up rates are greater in areas of higher risk and that take-up rates and coverage levels increase with the education and income of homeowners and with higher home values (Atreya et al., 2015, Kousky, 2011, Kriesel and Landry, 2004, Landry and Jahan-Parvar, 2011). One prior study examines voluntary purchases of flood insurance using a survey of residents in Texas and Florida (Brody et al., 2017). The authors find that those voluntarily purchasing a flood policy are more likely to own more expensive homes and have higher levels of education.====Researchers have also found that after a serious flood event or a year with high flood damages, take-up rates for flood insurance increase, but the effect diminishes after a few years (Browne and Hoyt, 2000, Gallagher, 2014). Much of this increase, however, could be driven by a requirement that recipients of federal disaster aid purchase flood insurance. An examination of take-up rates for flood insurance after hurricanes finds that this requirement increased take-up rates by about 5%, with only an additional 1.5% increase in take-up rates not due to this requirement (Kousky, 2017). These flood policies may not be maintained, however: the bump in policies is gone three years after the disaster (Kousky, 2017).====We contribute to the literature on the demand for flood insurance by conducting a holistic analysis of the market for publicly provided flood insurance in the U.S. Specifically, we separately examine policies that are inside SFHAs, and thus likely subject to the mandatory purchase requirement, and policies outside of SFHAs, and voluntarily purchased. We construct a Census tract-level panel dataset of take-up rates for NFIP residential policies that covers the contiguous U.S. between 2009 and 2019, calculating take-up rates for non-SFHA and SFHA households separately. We combine data on flood insurance policies and flood claims from FEMA with estimates of the number of households in and out of the SFHA calculated by combining remote sensing data, Census survey results, and FEMA floodplain boundaries. We integrate these data on the NFIP with novel data on flood risk provided through a partnership with the First Street Foundation; disaster declaration data from FEMA; and a range of sociodemographic, household, and geographic controls from the Census and other sources.====We begin our analysis of insurance demand by exploring those attributes which correlate with demand, both outside and within SFHAs. We then turn to estimating key parameters of interest: households’ willingness-to-pay for insurance and the degree of asymmetrically used information in the market for flood insurance. To estimate demand elasticities, we make use of quasi-experimental, policy-induced variation in flood insurance premiums from two recent reform events to account for the potential endogeneity of prices in this setting. Given our access to both claims and policy data, we implement a conceptually intuitive approach to testing for the presence of asymmetrically used information on flood risk that does not require quasi-experimental variation: the “unused observables” test of Finkelstein and Poterba (2014), which we implement using a granular measure of inundation risk derived from the First Street Foundation National Flood Model (FSF-NFM). The logic of this test is that in a symmetric information environment, the insurer will condition prices on characteristics that are correlated with both demand for insurance coverage and the risk of experiencing a loss. If we observe correlations between insurance demand, ex-post measures of risk experience, and our FSF-NFM based measure of inundation risk, this is suggestive of asymmetrically used information on flood risk.====Our analysis offers three main findings. First, we find that households appear to be responsive to prices when opting into flood insurance under the NFIP, though this response is relatively inelastic. Our results suggest that a 1% increase in the average price of non-SFHA policies results in a 0.290% decrease in the probability that a non-SFHA household purchases insurance and that a 1% increase in the average price of SFHA policies results in a 0.327% decrease in the probability that an SFHA household purchases insurance. Second, we find that the market for flood insurance under the NFIP is likely characterized by some level of asymmetrically used information on flood risk. We find that a 1 percentage point increase in the probability that a household is at risk of flooding according to FSF-NFM increases the probability of purchasing insurance by 369% and the average claim amount by 60% outside of SFHAs and increases the probability of purchasing insurance by 48% and the average claim amount by 58% inside of SFHAs. We offer adverse selection as a plausible explanation for our finding of asymmetrically used information in the NFIP. Our third and final takeaway is that there appears to be substantial heterogeneity in insurance take-up across certain observable household attributes, including income and education, which provides an important roadmap for policymakers interested in increasing the financial well-being of households exposed to natural hazard risks by indicating those communities in which take-up rates are particularly low and where targeted efforts may be most needed.====The federal government holds the risk for NFIP flood policies. The approach to rate-setting under the NFIP has not been updated in decades and currently includes many cross-subsidies, as broad flood zones are used to set prices instead of more granular measures of flood risk. In addition, some policies receive discounted prices (for more detail on pricing, see Kousky et al., 2017). For years where claims exceed the program’s revenue, the NFIP has borrowing authority from the U.S. Treasury. Pricing in the program, however, is not designed to cover catastrophic losses, and high claims years beginning in 2005 and continuing with major storms in 2008, 2012, and 2017 have led the program to carry a debt exceeding $20 billion despite Congressional approval for $16 billion in debt forgiveness after Hurricane Harvey in 2017 (Horn and Webel, 2021). To address the program’s fiscal solvency issues and better align incentives through premiums that reflect property-level risk, various reforms to the rate setting process have been proposed in recent years. As of July 2021, a particular set of reforms to modernize rate-setting—collectively referred to as “Risk Rating 2.0”—are planned to enter into force in October 2021 (Horn, 2021). Our results suggest that these reforms will likely mitigate the asymmetric use of information in the NFIP, potentially reducing adverse selection in the program. If rate increases under these reforms focus on the highest risk areas (note: not the SFHA, but the highest flood risk areas) leaving premiums for lower risk households unchanged (or lower), then it is likely that rate changes can improve the fiscal sustainability of the program and possibly increase overall insurance penetration.====The next section of our paper provides additional background on flood insurance in the U.S. We explain our data sources in Section 3 and then detail the empirical methods that we employ in studying flood insurance demand in Section 4. In Section 5 we present and discuss our results and in Section 6 we provide our primary conclusions.",Voluntary purchases and adverse selection in the market for flood insurance,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069621000826,14 August 2021,2021,Research Article,137.0

For identification, we exploit variation in the timing and the spatial distribution of the introduction of new Low Emission Zones across cities in Germany since 2008. We combine detailed geo-coded hospitalization data from the universe of German hospitals with the geographic coverage of Low Emission Zones over the period from 2006 to 2016. We find that Low Emission Zones reduce levels of air pollution in urban areas. These improvements in air quality translate into small but statistically significant population health benefits by lowering the share of diagnoses related to air pollution for hospitals located within a Low Emission Zone after it becomes effective. The results are mainly driven by reductions in circulatory and chronic lower respiratory diseases.","Air pollution is a major concern for human health and well-being across the globe. According to the World Health Organization, about seven million premature deaths per year as well as a wide range of health hazards, in particular respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, can be attributed to poor air quality (WHO, 2018).==== While adverse health effects of air pollution may be more severe in the developing world, many places in high-income countries are also faced with serious violations of air quality standards. This also creates large economic costs through hampered human capital formation (Graff Zivin and Neidell, 2013), increasing defensive medical spending (Deschênes et al., 2017) and reductions in workers’ labor supply and productivity (Graff Zivin and Neidell, 2018).====Emissions from traffic are a major source of ambient air pollution in densely populated urban areas (Karagulian et al., 2015). Automobile exhaust is particularly harmful to human health because it is mostly emitted close to the ground. Thus, reducing air pollution from traffic is of great importance for environmental policy-making. In the European Union, a key policy measure to reduce ambient air pollution in inner-cities is the implementation of Low Emission Zones, signposted areas where access of vehicles is regulated, typically banning high-emitting vehicles from entering the zone altogether. While access regulations impose costs on local residents and businesses, benefits may accrue in form of improved health, worker productivity and human capital. However, there is limited evidence about potential health benefits from policy interventions aiming at improving air quality in inner-cities. This is remarkable since policy measures, such as Low Emission Zones, are typically justified by improvements in population health.====In this paper, we study whether the implementation of Low Emission Zones affects population health through improvements in air quality. In particular, we focus on hospitalizations due to specific diseases related to air pollution. For causal identification of the impact of Low Emission Zones on hospitalizations, we exploit the staggered introduction of this policy measure across German cities since 2008, which induces variation in the timing as well as the exact geographic coverage of Low Emission Zones in a difference-in-differences framework.==== The policy treatment of introducing a Low Emission Zone is triggered by local violations of European Union air quality standards. The decision to implement a Low Emission Zone is then forced upon cities by state governments who are responsible for compliance with air quality legislation. We exploit policy variation in the extent to which inner-city areas, usually the city center, are covered by Low Emission Zones across time.====We combine information on the geographic coverage of Low Emission Zones with rich panel data on the universe of German hospitals over the period from 2006 to 2016. In our main regression specification, we exploit exact information on hospital locations at the address level and define a binary treatment indicator based on whether a hospital is located within the boundaries of an active Low Emission Zone, but also provide results for alternative treatment specifications using hospital catchment areas. The hospital data further provide annual frequencies of detailed diagnoses based on international standard classification (ICD-10). We mainly focus on circulatory and respiratory diseases, which have been shown to be affected by key target pollutants like particulate matter and nitrogen oxides (Graff Zivin and Neidell, 2013). In order to establish that our estimates of Low Emission Zones’ health impacts can indeed be attributed to improvements in local air quality, we additionally use data from Germany’s official air pollution monitoring system and assign monitor locations to Low Emission Zones and test whether air pollution is affected by a Low Emission Zone.====Our main results show that Low Emission Zone introductions benefit population health by reducing the frequency of hospitalizations. In a first step, we confirm that Low Emission Zones moderately improve air quality, by lowering annual mean levels and especially by decreasing the frequency of exceeding regulatory thresholds. In a second step, we show that these improvements in air quality translate into small but statistically significant reductions in the prevalence of specific air pollution-related diagnoses among hospitals which are located within the boundaries of an active Low Emission Zone. We find a small and statistically insignificant reduction in the overall share of inpatient cases related to any disease. However, we do find statistically significant effects for diagnoses of specific circulatory and respiratory diseases. In particular, a treated hospital’s share of diagnosed ischemic heart diseases, heart problems caused by narrowed heart arteries, is reduced by about 0.5 percentage points on average compared to a mean of about four percent. The share of chronic lower respiratory diseases, characterized by shortness of breath (e.g., asthma) are reduced by about 0.16 percentage points compared to an overall mean of about one percent of annual hospitalizations. These results are statistically significant and robust to a number of controls and specifications.====In addition, we provide evidence suggesting that spillovers of health benefits to hospitals outside the Low Emission Zone appear to be rather limited. We interact the binary treatment for a hospital location being covered by an active Low Emission Zone with a binary indicator for being located in a city with any Low Emission Zone and find that our results are predominantly driven by hospitals located inside a Low Emission Zone. We further show results based on alternative specifications of hospitals’ treatment by Low Emission Zone coverage. We exploit the exact information on hospital locations and create hospital catchment areas using geo-referenced data on driving time. We create hospital catchment areas as adjacent polygons around hospital locations that characterize areas in which the driving time to the associated hospital is shorter than the driving time to any other hospital in the surrounding. By overlaying these catchment areas with Low Emission Zone areas, we create the share of a hospital’s catchment area covered by an active Low Emission Zone as an alternative indicator capturing the intensity of treatment. The results are very similar to the results obtained from our main binary specification, but are less precise as the share of a constructed catchment area covered by a Low Emission Zone is more prone to measurement error than the simple binary treatment indicator for being located within the Low Emission Zone.====The magnitudes of our findings are rather small in absolute terms and are concentrated among diseases with strong symptoms (chest pain, shortness of breath) that are more likely to trigger a hospital visit than other diseases and symptoms related to poor air quality that would not show up in a hospital. This is not surprising given that the moderate air quality improvements from the implementation of Low Emission Zones, starting from already moderate levels of air pollution in Germany in global comparison, should not give grounds for expecting large reductions in hospitalizations, which is a rather severe health outcome. Therefore, the relatively small effects on hospitalizations documented in this paper do certainly not cover the overall health benefits of implementing Low Emission Zones in German cities, but do contribute to our understanding of the overall effects.====Evaluating the treatment effects of Germany’s Low Emission Zones on population health using hospitalizations as the outcome of interest is generally challenging. The analysis presented in this paper is based on aggregate hospital data, which comes with the qualification that detailed information on patients’ exposure to the treatment of Low Emission Zones is unavailable. The ideal database for studying our research question would combine ====-level hospitalization data with information on patients’ residence locations in order to assign the treatment to the residential population. Unfortunately, this is prohibited by German data protection legislation. While the data used in this study provide information on the total inpatient case numbers broken down by detailed diagnoses according to the standard ICD-10 classification and allow a precise geographic assignment of ==== locations to Low Emission Zone areas, a major drawback is that we do not have any information on where patients live. Therefore, we have to assume that hospitals draw their pool of patients mainly from the near surroundings, which is supported by the institutional setting as well as suggestive evidence, but still introduces measurement error to our regression analysis which needs to be taken into account when interpreting our results.====One potential alternative data source are hospital statistics provided by the German Statistical Office. These provide information on ==== patient admissions, but without any information on hospital locations and with patients’ residence only available at the aggregate county level, such that treatment assignment is only between cities without distinguishing between treated and untreated populations within cities. Accordingly, using these data, a closely related paper on the population health effects of Germany’s Low Emission Zones (Margaryan, 2021) does find reductions in hospital admissions, which are however statistically insignificant. Based on ==== data, which allow to assign patient residences on the postal code level (within cities), Margaryan (2021) documents statistically significant reductions in case numbers of cardiovascular diseases. At the same time, we document that our results appear to be mainly driven by hospitals actually located inside a city’s Low Emission Zone, while hospitals of the same city but outside of the Low Emission Zone area itself do not experience similar-sized reductions in case numbers of the relevant circulatory and respiratory diseases. Taken together, the evidence points to a pattern of fairly local effects of Low Emission Zones, such that the population actually treated within an adopting city mainly benefits in terms of improved health while positive health spillovers appear to be limited.====Overall, this paper contributes to the growing literature on the evaluation of the impacts of introducing Low Emission Zones in Germany. The earliest paper in economics on the effects on air pollution is the study by Wolff (2014), complemented by a related literature in transportation research (Morfeld et al., 2014, Malina and Scheffler, 2015, Jiang et al., 2017), documenting significant drops in ambient air pollution after Low Emission Zone introductions in treated cities in Germany. Wolff (2014) further shows that reductions in air pollution are driven by an improvement of the vehicle fleet in terms of emission standards. Our contribution is an extension of the analysis including the most recent Low Emission Zone implementations in Germany at a higher spatial accuracy using within-city variation. Gehrsitz (2017) evaluates the effects of Low Emission Zones on infant health outcomes in Germany. His results do not indicate substantial reductions in the prevalence of low birth weight or the number of stillbirths in Germany following a ban of high-emission vehicles. However, due to data constraints Gehrsitz (2017) is only able to assign mothers’ residential locations to cities but cannot make the distinction between treated and untreated mothers within cities, such that the policy variation is restricted to between-city variation, which may introduce measurement error regarding the in utero exposure to air pollution. As mentioned before, the study by Margaryan (2021) documents reductions in case numbers of cardiovascular diseases by 2–3 percent based on outpatient data from ambulatory care claims. Different from the results of our paper, Margaryan (2021) does not find any effects on respiratory health based on outpatient data. This may point to a pattern that improvements in air quality from Low Emission Zone introductions translate into health benefits in terms of cardiovascular health for moderate to high levels of severity while respiratory health improvements predominantly due to reductions in severe cases that typically lead to hospitalizations. However, using patient-level data from Germany’s largest health insurer, Rohlf et al. (2020) find that the introduction of Low Emission Zones significantly reduces expenditures for both heart and respiratory diseases by 15.8 million euros per year in treated cities. Importantly, Rohlf et al. (2020) provide a cost–benefit comparison based on an estimate of the upfront costs of updating the vehicle fleet and conclude that health benefits from reductions in defensive pharmaceutical expenditures alone recover the initial costs over 9–11 years. In this paper, we also provide complementing evidence that there appear to be no negative effects on GDP in counties treated with a Low Emission Zone, such that we feel comfortable to conclude that an overall cost–benefit analysis of the policy, accounting for hospitalizations, outpatient case numbers and pharmaceutical expenditures, appears to be in favor of restricting high-emitting vehicles from urban areas.====More generally, we add to the large literature on the causal impacts of air pollution on human health in both epidemiology (Pope III, 2000, Pope III and Dockery, 2006) as well as in economics (Graff Zivin and Neidell, 2013) and to a recent strand in the economics literature evaluating the impacts of other traffic regulations to improve urban air quality on health outcomes. Simeonova et al. (2019) show that implementing a congestion tax in central Stockholm reduced ambient air pollution and significantly decreased the rate of acute asthma attacks among young children.==== While children, especially newborns, are particularly vulnerable to detrimental environmental conditions (Almond and Currie, 2013), the elderly as well as the working-age population are also negatively affected by air pollution (Schlenker and Walker, 2016, Deschênes et al., 2017, Karlsson and Ziebarth, 2018). In this paper, similar to Margaryan (2021) and Rohlf et al. (2020), we are able to study the full range of diseases potentially affected by ambient air pollution among all age groups. Salvo et al. (2019) show that removing Diesel trucks from passing through the inner-city of S====o Paulo by inaugurating a beltway had positive effects on congestion, pollution, health and mortality benefiting the mega-city’s population. The results of our paper indicate that potential improvements in population health from reductions in traffic emissions are not restricted to locations starting from extremely high levels of air pollution but that health improvements can be achieved also for medium-sized cities with ex ante moderate levels of air pollution.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we provide background information about German Low Emission Zones, targeted pollutants and show the effect of Low Emission Zones on air pollution. Section 3 describes the empirical analysis and results.

The data for this analysis stem from a large-scale computer-based survey among more than 3700 German citizens. Our indicators for environmental values are based on the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP), which is a standard instrument in social and behavioral sciences and increasingly common in economic studies. The ","Previous economic studies show that environmentally relevant behavior is affected by a broad range of factors such as socio-demographics (e.g. Lange and Ziegler, 2017), but also social norms (e.g. Allcott, 2011; Videras et al., 2012) or attitudinal factors like warm glow (e.g. Schwirplies and Ziegler, 2016) or individual values (e.g. Kahn, 2007, considering political orientation). With respect to the latter factor, environmental values seem to be most relevant. For example, Kotchen and Moore (2008) analyze the effect of membership in an environmental organization on electricity consumption and Dastrup et al. (2012) examine the effect of contributions to environmental organizations on the probability of living in solar homes. Recently, New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) scales according to Dunlap et al. (2000), which are a standard instrument in social and behavioral sciences, are increasingly common as indicator for environmental values, concern, awareness, or attitudes in economics. For example, NEP scales are considered to explain the participation in green electricity programs (e.g. Kotchen and Moore, 2007), electricity conservation (e.g. Delmas and Lessem, 2014), or further climate protection activities (e.g. Lange et al., 2017). The NEP scales incorporate ideas like growth limits and the significance of the balance of nature. Furthermore, they measure general beliefs about the relationship between humankind and the natural environment (e.g. Dunlap, 2008).====This paper examines the relationship between two NEP scales and common economic preferences like risk and time preferences, trust, and reciprocity. In addition to social norms and individual values, economic studies reveal that such preferences from behavioral economics also play an important role for the explanation of individual behavior and life outcomes (e.g. Dohmen et al., 2011; Sutter et al., 2013). With respect to environmentally relevant behavior, Fischbacher et al. (2021) specifically identify correlations between risk and time preferences and investments in energy saving measures. However, Albanese et al. (2017) show that risk and time preferences, trust, and reciprocity are correlated with each other. On this basis, they argue that neglecting one of these indicators when explaining individual behavior can lead to strong distortions due to omitted variable biases. Similarly, Dohmen et al. (2008) reveal (negative) correlations between trust and negative reciprocity and Dohmen et al. (2010) reveal positive correlations between cognitive ability, risk taking preferences, and patience. The latter study argues that significant effects of cognitive ability on individual behavior can be due to its relationship with these two economic preferences.====Against this background, it can also be speculated that the estimated effects of environmental values and specifically of NEP scales on environmentally relevant behavior are biased if economic preferences are correlated with environmental values and not additionally included in econometric analyses, i.e. the estimated effects of environmental values might be distorted by possible effects of economic preferences. So far, almost no study considering the effects of environmental values includes such preferences. One exception is the study of Fischbacher et al. (2021), which shows the relevance of risk and time preferences for energy efficiency measures. However, Fischbacher et al. (2021) do not examine possible distortions for the estimated effect of the NEP scale if some economic preferences are not considered in the econometric analysis. Previous empirical analyses instead typically assume, at least implicitly, that environmental values are uncorrelated with economic preferences. However, this assumption has received no attention in empirical economic studies so far. The main contribution of our systematic econometric analysis of the relationship between NEP scales and common economic preferences is therefore to identify possible biased estimation results in this respect.====In addition to risk and time preferences, trust, and positive and negative reciprocity, our econometric analysis considers altruism, for which several studies reveal direct effects on environmentally relevant behavior (e.g. Clark et al., 2003; Kotchen and Moore, 2007; Fischbacher et al., 2021). Since our identification of time preferences and altruism is based on artefactual field experiments (e.g. Levitt and List, 2009; List, 2011), our empirical analysis also contributes to previous studies (e.g. Dohmen et al., 2011; Fischbacher et al., 2021) that mimic laboratory experiments in the field by considering incentivized measures in a computer-based survey among more than 3700 German citizens. Our econometric analysis with Generalized Poisson regression models reveals that our variables for altruism and positive reciprocity are significantly positively correlated, whereas the indicators for trust and (less robust) negative reciprocity are significantly negatively correlated with environmental values, respectively. Only our variables for risk and time preferences are not robustly significantly correlated with the NEP scales.====Possible omitted variable biases are examined in additional econometric analyses of the effects of a NEP scale on environmentally relevant behavior, i.e. environmental donation activities. While the first application example refers to stated donations, the second example of realized donations is based on a framed field experiment. Both examples suggest overestimated effects of a NEP scale if economic preferences are insufficiently included as control variables. To test the robustness of the identified omitted variable biases, we have also conducted a series of systematic Monte Carlo experiments which confirm and even strengthen the conclusions from the previous estimation results. Based on the explanatory variables and thus the data generation processes (DGP) from the second application example of revealed environmental donations, the experiments show how different parameter constellations for the economic preferences lead to different biases in the estimated effects of a NEP scale on environmental donation activities.

This information guides regulatory assessments and future changes to the regulations. When regulations overlap, however, simple interpretations of credit prices no longer hold. We derive formulas for interpreting the value of credit prices for three overlapping regulations for passenger vehicles: corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards, greenhouse gas (GHG) standards, and zero emissions vehicle (ZEV) programs. Our assessment reveals that the marginal costs of reducing GHGs from conventional gasoline vehicles are virtually equal to the sum of CAFE and GHG credit prices, since each policy regulates emissions/fuel use in nearly the same way. We calculate that marginal costs ranged between $8 and $16 per ton of carbon dioxide in 2017. In contrast, marginal costs of selling one additional ZEV were $6,000 to $11,000 in 2017, which are higher than the ZEV credit price. This difference is because selling an additional ZEV yields compliance cost savings under the CAFE and GHG programs.","The United States transportation sector is undergoing a rapid transformation, partly due to federal and state policies, including federal corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) and greenhouse gas (GHG) standards and state-level zero emissions vehicle (ZEV) mandates imposed on each passenger vehicle manufacturer. Current federal tailpipe standards require a year-over-year increase in manufacturer fleetwide fuel economy and an equivalent reduction in GHG emissions of new vehicles sold. Meanwhile, to expand the market share of electric vehicles, 12 states led by California have adopted their own ZEV mandates for manufacturers,.====The policies have been criticized for being expensive methods of achieving climate goals. One way that policymakers have addressed this concern is to provide additional compliance flexibility for vehicle manufacturers in the form of credit trading. All three policies include a trading program to allow flexibility for manufacturers to meet the separate requirements.====The programs have three separate credit systems: one for the CAFE program, one for the GHG program, and one for the ZEV mandate. Leard and McConnell (2017) provide a detailed description of the CAFE and GHG credit markets, and McConnell et al. (2019) and McConnell and Leard (2021) describe the ZEV credit market.====Credit prices reveal information about abatement costs. In a stylized setting with a single regulation and no distortions, the price of a credit reveals the marginal cost of abatement. This information can be used to estimate the cost of the regulation, which can guide regulatory impact analysis assessments and future changes to the regulation. But in the current setting with three overlapping regulations, this result may not hold. Prior literature on overlapping regulations has focused on emissions leakage (Goulder and Stavins 2011; Goulder et al., 2012), and on how broader complementary regulations can affect the price of credits in cap-and-trade markets (Borenstein et al., 2019; Schmalensee and Stavins, 2013). In this paper, we focus on the transportation sector, and use a simple analytical model to explore the effects of having multiple concurrent regulations, all with market trading, on the interpretation of credit prices. We address the following question: Do credit prices still reflect the marginal costs of reducing emissions when regulations overlap?====Our model reveals two key findings. First, using simple closed-form formulas for computing marginal abatement costs, we find that multiple credit prices must be known to infer information about marginal costs of a single regulation. In particular, while the marginal costs of reducing GHG emissions from gasoline vehicles can be inferred from CAFE and GHG credit prices, computing the marginal costs of mandating ZEVs requires credit prices from all three crediting programs. Second, we calibrate our formulas to calculate marginal costs of abatement. We find that the marginal cost of reducing GHGs is nearly equal to the sum of CAFE and GHG credit prices, as each policy regulates emissions in the same way. We also find that the marginal cost of selling one additional ZEV is larger than the ZEV credit price, since selling an additional ZEV makes it less costly to comply with the CAFE and GHG programs.",Interpreting tradable credit prices in overlapping vehicle regulations,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069621000796,28 July 2021,2021,Research Article,140.0

We use the model to calculate the ====, which determines how behavioral changes offset energy efficiency improvements. We use the framework to decompose the rebound effect into partial and ==== components. In our theoretical analysis, we identify key drivers of the general equilibrium rebound effect, including a composition channel, an energy price channel, a growth channel, and a labor supply channel. Based on numerical simulations with a parameterized version of the model, we show that both general and partial equilibrium components of the rebound effect can be substantial. We thus caution against hopes to resolve adverse impacts of fossil fuel use such as climate change via energy efficiency improvements from costless technological advances.","Improvements in energy efficiency are considered one of the most important and cost-effective pathways for achieving significant reductions in fossil energy demand and thereby in greenhouse gas emissions.==== However, economists have long recognized that improvements in energy efficiency may lead to increased use of energy services, offsetting a portion of the potential energy savings. The origin of this insight is credited to Jevons (1865).==== More formal analysis of what is now called the ==== was initiated by Khazzoom (1980) and Brookes (1990), who cast the basic insight of Jevons (1865) into a modern analytical framework. These authors showed that in some cases energy efficiency improvements could even ====, resulting in higher overall energy consumption. A large number of more recent contributions, synthesized by Greening et al., 2000, Sorrell et al., 2007, and Gillingham et al. (2016), have provided a taxonomy of the rebound effect along with empirical estimates on its magnitude.====Prior studies divide the rebound effect into three main components: (1) the ==== rebound effect or ==== effect, whereby consumers substitute energy services for other inputs as the relative price of energy services is reduced due to an energy efficiency improvement; (2) the ==== rebound effect, or ==== effect, where gains in real income resulting from improved energy efficiency are spent on energy services and other goods and services (which themselves require energy to produce); and (3) the ==== rebound effect, whereby commodity and factor prices throughout the economy return to equilibrium following an improvement in energy efficiency, resulting in changes in energy consumption throughout the economy (Greening et al., 2000, Sorrell et al., 2007, Gillingham et al., 2016).==== The first two of these are ==== effects, estimated by holding prices throughout the economy fixed, except the price of energy services. The third is a ==== effect, which is the net effect of the energy efficiency improvement on energy demand, once all prices in the economy have returned to equilibrium following the exogenous shock to energy efficiency.====In this paper, we focus on ==== rebound effects.==== While the theoretical analysis of the partial equilibrium rebound effect is well advanced (Chan and Gillingham, 2015, Borenstein, 2015), theoretical insights on general equilibrium rebound effects are less elaborated. Reflecting these different stages in theory-based research, applied economic analysis provides relatively coherent estimates on the magnitude of partial equilibrium rebound effects (Small and Van Dender, 2007, Gillingham et al., 2013, Gillingham, 2014, De Borger et al., 2016), while numerical estimates on the magnitude of general equilibrium rebound effects appear rather scattered. In this context, Greening et al. (2000) state that the size of the general equilibrium rebound effect is “highly uncertain and deserves further study” (p. 391). Borenstein (2015) likewise suggests that general equilibrium rebound effects are ill-understood (p. 11), and Gillingham et al. (2013) say that general equilibrium “rebound effects are hard to pin down” (p. 476). A review of numerical estimates of the general equilibrium rebound reveals larger variations, which stem from differences in definitions, data sources, and the nature of the underlying policy shocks. There is a clear lack of a concise logic on the sources and coherent estimates on the magnitude of general equilibrium rebound effects (Gillingham et al., 2016).====We develop a simple analytical general equilibrium model, in the spirit of Harberger (1962) and Jones (1965), to explore the rebound effect of an exogenous and costless energy efficiency improvement. We use the model to decompose the change in energy demand into a partial equilibrium component – which has been the subject of most research so far – and a general equilibrium component, which has received much less scrutiny.====Our model articulates four pathways for the general equilibrium rebound effect to materialize: a composition channel, an energy price channel, a growth channel, and a labor supply channel — see Fig. 1 for a taxonomy of rebound effects. While other papers have included most of these channels, the contribution in this paper is to decompose how general equilibrium rebound is determined by these four channels and thus promote understanding of the factors that give rise to general equilibrium rebound.====General equilibrium rebound via the ==== refers to changes in energy consumption that arise due to structural change in the economy following the exogenous energy efficiency improvement. We show that the magnitude of this effect depends on the energy intensity and the size of the sector that receives the energy efficiency improvement as well as the elasticity of substitution between goods in final demand. General equilibrium rebound via the ==== occurs when an improvement in energy efficiency exerts a downward pressure on the energy price, leading to increased energy consumption that offsets a portion of the original energy savings. We show that the magnitude of this channel depends critically on the elasticity of supply for energy, which, along with the elasticity of demand for energy, determines the new equilibrium energy price following an energy shock. General equilibrium rebound via the ==== refers to the idea that an energy efficiency improvement causes an increase in the return on capital, which could stimulate investment and thus increase the steady-state capital stock. In response, the output of the economy increases, causing an increase in energy consumption that offsets a portion of the original energy savings. We show that the magnitude of the rebound effect through the growth channel is determined by the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor as well as the energy intensity of the economy. It is important to note that our evaluation of the growth channel includes only one mechanism through which energy efficiency innovations may cause economic growth (via increases in capital stock), and that future studies may consider other pathways. General equilibrium rebound via the ==== can occur because an improvement in energy efficiency will affect the real wage rate. To the extent that consumers adjust labor supply in response to changes in the real wage rate, this will cause a change in labor supplied to productive sectors in the economy, and thus to energy consumption. We show that the magnitude of the rebound effect that occurs through the labor supply channel is directly related to the elasticity of substitution between consumption and leisure.====Our model of the general equilibrium rebound effect is useful for identifying key drivers and their relative importance in undermining energy savings from efficiency improvements. The analysis thus helps to open up the ‘black box’ of computable general equilibrium models which are widely used to estimate the rebound effect. Differences in quantitative estimates of the rebound effect can be traced back to how models differ in the coverage of major rebound channels and their parametrization.====As with many economy-wide phenomena, econometrically estimating the effect of the general equilibrium rebound is challenging. To obtain quantitative estimates of the general equilibrium rebound effect, we therefore make use of numerical simulations. We calibrate our stylized analytic model to US macroeconomic data to quantify the size of the general equilibrium rebound effects that occur through the channels above. Our estimates suggest that both partial as well as general equilibrium components of the rebound effect can be substantial. If the elasticity of demand for energy services is low (as is suggested by some strands of the empirical literature, such as Small and Van Dender (2007) and Gillingham (2014)), the general equilibrium component of the rebound effect can dominate the partial equilibrium component. Conversely, if the elasticity of demand for energy services is relatively high, the rebound effect is dominated by the partial equilibrium component. Over a range of reasonable parameterizations, three of the channels of the general equilibrium rebound effect identified above – the composition channel, the energy price channel, and the growth channel – can be important contributors, while we find that the labor supply channel does not produce substantial rebound effects.====A number of other papers have studied rebound effects in general equilibrium using theoretical models. The one-sector approaches of Saunders, 2000, Wei, 2007, Wei, 2010, and Rausch and Schwerin (2018) emphasize the investment and growth effects of energy efficiency improvements; they find that improvements in energy efficiency can spur investment, leading to higher growth and energy consumption. Because they build on single-sector models, these approaches ignore the potential impacts of energy efficiency improvements on inter-sectoral output and energy consumption. These papers also do not decompose the drivers of general equilibrium rebound, so although they include what we refer to as the growth channel, they do not determine its relative importance vis-à-vis other general equilibrium rebound effects.====Blackburn and Moreno-Cruz (2019) set out a multi-sector model that considers the structure of inter-sectoral linkages using a network topology approach, and find that general equilibrium rebound effects are affected by the centrality of the energy efficiency shock in the production network. Chang et al. (2018) examine rebound effects associated with promotion of a clean technology using a dynamic two-good (clean and dirty goods), two-sector model. They focus on pollution as by-product of consumption, and do not explicitly include energy or derive energy efficiency rebound effects. Chang et al. (2018) find that general equilibrium rebound effects nearly or completely offset reductions in pollution from green technology promotion.====Two papers written concurrently with this one investigate general equilibrium rebound using a similar framework as in this paper: Lemoine (2020) and Fullerton and Ta (2020). However, the three papers differ in structural assumptions that open or close various channels for general equilibrium rebound, and differ in how they choose to decompose overall rebound into different channels. Furthermore, they estimate rebound in different policy scenarios, and conduct sensitivity analysis for different parameters. Table 1 is our best effort to contrast the different studies using our taxonomy for rebound effects. A high-level observation from Table 1 is that there exists a very wide range of rebound effect estimates, with total rebound effects ranging from less than zero (“super-conservation”) to over 60%. Most importantly for the purposes of this article, the general equilibrium component of rebound also varies widely across studies, from less than 0% to more than 20%. We attempt to uncover reasons for these differences below.====Lemoine (2020) develops a static multi-sector model to investigate the rebound triggered by an exogenous and costless energy efficiency improvement in a producing sector. Opposite to our setting, his analytical model does not consider the growth channel as he focuses on labor as the single primary factor of production. Furthermore, his analysis abstains from the introduction of a fixed specific factor in energy supply which in our model establishes the energy price channel. On the other hand, Lemoine (2020) considers that the energy producing technology may consume energy itself. This extension gives rise to what he calls an energy supply amplifier to the overall rebound effect, reflecting how energy efficiency improvements in a consumption good sector affect the demand for energy resources in the energy supply sector. In addition, the own-consumption of energy resources in the energy supply sector permits him to study what he calls the resource supply effect, i.e., the rebound through improvements in the technology used to produce the energy resource. When no energy resources are consumed in the energy supply sector, both the energy supply amplifier and the resource supply rebound effect vanish which is the case in our analytical model. As in our setting, Lemoine (2020) accounts for a labor supply and a composition channel (calling the latter output price effect).====Lemoine (2020) parameterizes the model with data from US national economic accounts to numerically estimate potential rebound effects associated with a costless energy efficiency improvement across all non-energy supply sectors. In the central case, Lemoine (2020) finds that about 28% of the gains associated with energy efficiency improvements in all non-energy production sectors are offset due to rebound, with considerable heterogeneity across sectors. This is lower than the central case finding in this paper, and of particular note is that the general equilibrium component of rebound differs between our study and Lemoine (2020). The difference between studies does not appear to be due to choice of elasticities, since partial equilibrium rebound is similar in the two studies. Instead, the two models have different structures, in part because Lemoine (2020) introduces own-consumption of energy in the energy supply sector (which reduces the magnitude of general equilibrium rebound by about 12 percentage points in his central calibration – a large magnitude), and in part because our model simulations incorporate growth and energy price channels, while Lemoine (2020) does not include these; as shown in Table 1, these increase the general equilibrium rebound effect in our model.====Fullerton and Ta (2020) take the same (linearization) technique to solving for general equilibrium rebound as in this paper, but focus on the case where energy efficiency improvements are costly, such as when required due to an energy efficiency standard. Fullerton and Ta (2020) show that allowing for costs in energy efficiency improvements can reverse the sign of rebound. Fullerton and Ta (2020) consider the case where energy efficiency improvements are targeted at a consumer end-use technology, such as household appliances or vehicles, rather than at a production sector as in the present paper. Fullerton and Ta (2020) differ from the current paper in that they do not include a labor supply channel or a growth channel, but – like us – they do include the possibility of a composition channel. They do not include an energy price channel in their main results, but do consider this channel in a model extension. Fullerton and Ta (2020) decompose the change in energy consumption following an energy efficiency improvement into direct and indirect components. In their decomposition, direct rebound results from change in demand for the good that receives the energy efficiency improvement, while indirect rebound results from change in demand for other goods. This decomposition does not map directly to our taxonomy, but in Table 1 we consider their “direct” rebound effect as similar to our partial equilibrium rebound effect.====Overall, as shown in Table 1, when a costless energy efficiency improvement in home appliances (e.g., refrigerators) is introduced in their model, there is small partial equilibrium rebound of about 5%. This small partial equilibrium rebound is due to the small elasticity of demand for household energy services in their calibration. With a costless energy efficiency improvement, their model also admits general equilibrium rebound through what we refer to as the composition channel, which increases total rebound following a costless energy efficiency shock in home appliances to about 16%. The key differences between our model results and Fullerton and Ta (2020) when analyzing a costless technology shock is that we use a larger elasticity of substitution in the sector that receives the technology shock (leading to larger partial equilibrium rebound through the substitution channel), and we introduce more channels for general equilibrium rebound to occur. Both of these lead us to larger estimates of rebound than Fullerton and Ta (2020), as shown in Table 1. Fullerton and Ta (2020) also consider an energy efficiency improvement resulting from a costly energy efficiency mandate, rather than a costless shock. As shown in Table 1, the costly energy efficiency mandate causes a reduction in consumer income, which reduces consumer spending and resulting energy consumption, and leads to negative rebound. We do not consider costly mandates in this paper.====In addition to the theoretical literature, a number of papers have estimated general equilibrium rebound using computable general equilibrium models. Many of these models embed the same rebound channels as we elucidate in this paper, although few decompose model results to understand relative importance of different channels.==== Grepperud and Rasmussen (2004) apply the MSG-6 model to Norway and investigate exogenous energy efficiency improvements across six sectors individually (one-by-one). The authors report the sectoral rebound effect, rather than the overall rebound effect, i.e., they do not report the overall change in energy consumption following the exogenous shock. For the six different sectors, they identify opposing impacts (i.e., in some sectors, energy efficiency increases sectoral energy demand, while the opposite occurs in other sectors). In a series of papers using the ENVI model for the UK and Scotland, researchers report the overall change in energy consumption following an exogenous improvement in the energy efficiency for one sector of the economy (Allan et al., 2006, Hanley et al., 2006, Hanley et al., 2009, Turner and Hanley, 2011). Energy efficiency improvements in a sector lead to increases in economy-wide energy consumption, pointing to a rebound effect which is more than offsetting the initial energy efficiency improvement. The ENVI work builds on extensive sensitivity analysis, but no formal decomposition is undertaken to elucidate on the mechanisms that lead to rebound. Lecca et al. (2014) evaluate changes in energy efficiency of the household sector using a computable general equilibrium model for the UK. They offer some decomposition, by freezing prices to simulate partial equilibrium rebound, and allowing prices to move, to simulate general equilibrium rebound. In their analysis, the rebound effect turns out to be slightly less in general equilibrium than in partial equilibrium (i.e., the general equilibrium component of the rebound effect is negative). The rebound effect amounts to roughly 50%–60% of the initial energy efficiency improvement. Koesler et al. (2016) employ a multi-sector multi-region computable general equilibrium model of the world economy to simulate a costless 10% improvement in energy efficiency across German production sectors. Adding up changes in energy use across all regions and sectors of their model, they find that the total rebound is about 50%. Wei and Liu (2017) use the GRACE model to estimate general equilibrium rebound following a costless energy efficiency improvement, finding rebound effects in excess of 50% across most scenarios.====We believe that our work stands out from the preceding literature for the following reasons. First, we decompose analytically the general equilibrium rebound into four fundamental channels: the composition channel, the energy price channel, the growth channel, and the labor supply channel. Second, our analytical model is easily accessible and produces closed-form solutions that are straightforward to interpret on economic grounds. Third, one can parameterize our model with very limited and publicly available macroeconomic data to quantify the relative importance of the general equilibrium rebound and its constituent components. In this vein, we believe that our approach helps to open the “black box” associated with large-scale models that have until now represented the dominant approach to estimating economy-wide rebound effects.====Overall, our paper delivers a compelling taxonomy and systematic delineation of general equilibrium rebound effects together with their quantification based on straightforward numerical simulations as illustrated for the case of the US economy. Our central case estimates suggest that the total rebound from a costless energy efficiency improvement in the US manufacturing sector is around 60%. The partial equilibrium rebound effect is about 40%, with general equilibrium components making up the remaining 20%. Of the general equilibrium components, the energy price channel is most important, reflecting about three-quarters of the total general equilibrium rebound. In sum, our analysis suggests that a substantial portion of predicted energy savings from an energy-saving innovation are likely to be eroded by behavioral channels.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we develop our basic analytical model to derive closed-form solutions for the various components adding up to the total rebound effect. In Section 3 we parameterize the model with macroeconomic data for the US economy to obtain empirical estimates on the magnitude and composition of the rebound effect associated with exogenous energy efficiency improvements. In Section 4 we conclude.",The energy efficiency rebound effect in general equilibrium,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069621000772,9 July 2021,2021,Research Article,141.0

We document that foreign ownership has been taken over by partnerships as the leading ownership regime, while domestic ownership is on the rise again in recent years. We use this dataset to examine whether institutional change in the petroleum sector leads to more oil and gas exploration and discoveries. On average, switching to majority foreign ownership is related to up to a quarter of a ==== more discoveries than under majority domestic ownership. Switching to partnership is positively related to drilling activity, but is less likely to be linked to many more discoveries. Petroleum exploration and discoveries may thus be endogenous to industry-specific institutional change.","Proven world oil reserves have increased from 680 billion barrels in 1980 to more than 1700 billion barrels in 2019. Despite oil being an exhaustible resource in principle, we appear to be finding ever more of it.==== Although the existence of natural resource endowments is determined by local geology and is therefore exogenous, finding these resources often relies on foreign firms to provide capital and expertise, because many countries do not have the capital or technology available to engage in exploration themselves.==== Yet, it is often argued that known resource endowments are exogenous; that they are due to chance rather than to the political and economic environment of the host country; and that they therefore provide good measures of exogenous variation in resource wealth in the analysis of economic development (see e.g., Brunnschweiler and Bulte, 2008, Ploeg and Poelhekke, 2010, Cotet and Tsui, 2013).====This paper presents a new database that tracks the institutions that govern the petroleum sector, covering over a century of data for up to 68 oil-producing countries, and relates these institutional setups to petroleum exploration intensity and discoveries. Hydrocarbons continue to be a vital resource as a fuel, a source of electricity, or a source of foreign exchange, so understanding whether and how the institutional framework has any bearing on oil and gas discoveries is an important issue. Our dataset captures legal restrictions on control rights over petroleum exploration and production decisions, distinguishing between those that allow Domestic, Foreign, and mixed, or ‘Partnership’ ownership regimes. In addition, we show that the nationality of ownership is more important than the conventional distinction between public and private ownership (Bohn and Deacon, 2000, Wolf, 2009).====We document that Foreign ownership (typically in the form of concessions with long maturities in exchange for a royalty) has gradually been replaced by a bigger role for domestic firms as host countries’ nationalism and own-industry know-how have increased, to the point where Partnerships are the norm today. Domestic ownership has been on the rise again in recent years with partial or full nationalizations taking place in Russia (2005), Bolivia (2006), Ecuador, and Venezuela (both 2007).====We describe the evolution of ownership regimes over time, and regress measures of discoveries and drilling activity on ownership regimes. These results show that both switching to Foreign and Partnership regimes is positively related to drilling, but only Foreign ownership is significantly positively correlated with discoveries. We also show that the relationships between oil-sector-specific institutions and exploration and discovery are robust to controlling for broader national-level institutions and cumulative previous discoveries. These findings suggest that foreign petroleum firms are better able than domestic firms to gauge the risks involved in oil and gas exploration, and likely invest more in new technology and in geological and seismic knowledge. This gives them an edge over domestic firms that often operate in a protected home market.====In the online appendix we take a first step towards fixed-effects two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimations, which strengthen the result that adopting Domestic ownership is followed by a drop in discoveries. Our contribution is to improve our understanding of the specific institutions that may be adopted by countries, although in the absence of strong instruments, we do not claim that the link is causal, nor do we claim that the institutions that raise the probability of finding petroleum also lead to long-term economic development.====We extend the recent literature on the endogeneity of natural resource endowments (Arezki et al., 2019, Cust and Harding, 2020) by focusing on industry-specific institutions, rather than the more general institutional framework. In addition, we add to the literature that uses discoveries as exogenous variation for a range of outcomes (Lei and Michaels, 2014, Smith, 2015, Arezki et al., 2017). Our results suggest that the use of (the timing of) oil and gas discoveries as exogenous variation may be improved by controlling for the specific ownership regime under which those discoveries were made.",Pushing one’s luck: Petroleum ownership and discoveries,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069621000760,5 July 2021,2021,Research Article,142.0

It is often argued that such heterogeneities between countries is a major obstacle to cooperative climate policy. We use a stylized game mimicking basic features of the climate-change dilemma to experimentally study the effect of two important heterogeneities, ==== and loss when a catastrophic event occurs. We find that under loss heterogeneity the success rate in achieving sufficient mitigation to prevent a catastrophic event is higher than under symmetry. Moreover, neither endowment heterogeneity nor the combination of endowment and loss heterogeneities lead to significantly different success rates than under symmetry. These findings suggest that heterogeneities may in fact facilitate rather than hinder successful cooperation in catastrophe prevention.","There is strong scientific evidence that global warming can trigger catastrophic weather events (Marotzke, 2000, Alley et al., 2003; IPCC, 2013, 2018)). Mitigating such catastrophes requires the reduction of greenhouse gases, which can be considered as a global public good (Milinski et al., 2006, Raihani and Aitken, 2011). Since, in the short term, CO==== mitigation will inevitably reduce economic output and slow down growth, most countries choose to do nothing and at best free-ride on other countries’ mitigation efforts. Milinski et al. (2008) suggest modeling such a situation as a threshold public-good game, which they refer to as the “collective-risk social dilemma”. This game displays several distinct features. The first of them is a threshold that models an irreversible ‘tipping point’ in the earth’s climate system (Lenton et al., 2008; IPCC, 2013, 2018). Second, the outcome is only realized after several rounds of contribution. Third, the more wealth a player has accumulated, the more he/she risks to lose in the case of a catastrophic event.====This paper is motivated by the failure of the world community to engage sufficiently in the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions (Geiges et al., 2020). One possible reason for this is the existence of large heterogeneities between countries (Heyward, 2007),==== so equity considerations may be fundamental in implementing a successful path to mitigating climate change (Baer et al., 2000, Lange et al., 2010, Brick and Visser, 2015, Klinsky et al., 2017).====Two major heterogeneities between countries in the global climate-change dilemma are (i) in wealth and (ii) in the extent to which countries will be affected by climate change in the future (Frankhauser, 1994, Tol, 2009).==== Our approach is to reduce the complexity of the global climate-change dilemma situation to a stylized collective-risk social dilemma game, and use a lab experiment (Falk and Heckman, 2009) to investigate the primitive of human behavior regarding the causal effect of heterogeneities between parties in this stylized situation.====Our study is designed to address several issues. First, we study the effect of loss heterogeneity. Heterogeneity in expected losses is a recognized feature of the global climate-change dilemma (e.g., Mendelsohn et al., 2006; IPCC, 2013, 2018), and there is a large body of literature modeling climate change using different variants of public-good games. But, to our knowledge, the “pure” effect of heterogeneity in loss rates has not been tested before.====Secondly, we study how endowment heterogeneity affects success in preventing a collective risk and how it impacts on burden sharing. Previous experimental studies have already dealt with this question, but their findings are inconclusive. In the context of a collective-risk social dilemma, Tavoni et al. (2011) and Burton-Chellew et al. (2013) find that endowment heterogeneity reduces the success rate in reaching the catastrophe-prevention threshold. By contrast, Brown and Kroll (2017) do not find that endowment heterogeneity hinders catastrophe prevention. This applies to both certain and uncertain thresholds as well as to a situation where the probability of loss depends on the joint contribution level. In another related collective-risk social dilemma study, Milinski et al. (2011) find that participants contribute proportionally to the heterogeneous endowments.====A third and novel aim of our design is to compare behavior in theoretically equivalent situations of endowment and loss heterogeneity. This is important because, if equity considerations are crucial for reaching an agreement on climate-change mitigation, it is necessary to understand whether heterogeneities that are theoretically equivalent in terms of expected impacts are also perceived as equivalent by human participants.====Finally, climate-change experts predict that the effect of global warming may be especially devastating for poor countries located in low-latitude areas with high initial temperatures (Mendelsohn et al., 2006; IPCC, 2013, 2018, Bathiany et al., 2018). In particular, poor countries are less well equipped to deal with, and adapt to, catastrophic consequences of climate change, than their rich counterparts. Thus their expected losses from catastrophic events are also likely to be higher (Parry, 2007). To model such a situation, we combine the two types of heterogeneities (wealth and expected loss) and compare them to environments with single heterogeneities. In this connection, Burton-Chellew et al. (2013) conduct a double heterogeneity treatment where participants with a high endowment face a lower catastrophic risk than their low-endowment counterparts. They find success rates to be considerably lower in this double heterogeneity treatment than in the symmetric environment treatment and in the treatments with only one type of heterogeneity.====To this end, we have conducted two complementary experiments with a total of 726 participants. Each experiment consists of four treatments: symmetry, heterogeneity in endowment, heterogeneity in loss when a catastrophic event occurs, and double heterogeneity in endowment and loss. In the first experiment, endowment and loss heterogeneity are theoretically equivalent. As we show in the Appendix, this is only possible when the (non-cooperative) no-contribution equilibrium and the (cooperative) loss-prevention equilibrium are payoff-equivalent. In other words, in terms of payoffs, the design does not conform to the standard social-dilemma representation but can rather be considered to be its lower bound.==== In the second experiment, we sacrifice equivalence of endowment and loss heterogeneity, setting up a design that reflects a standard social-dilemma situation where the loss-prevention equilibria Pareto-dominate the no-contribution equilibrium. This follow-up experiment serves as a robustness check for the results from the first one.====The results of the two experiments can be summarized as follows: The success rate in preventing a catastrophic event is no higher under symmetry (homogeneous parties) than under either loss heterogeneity or endowment heterogeneity. In fact, under loss heterogeneity, the success rate is substantially higher than under symmetry. Under double heterogeneity, where low-endowment members face a higher loss rate than their richer counterparts, the success rate in preventing a catastrophe is statistically indistinguishable from that of endowment heterogeneity. As to overall burden-sharing in successful groups in achieving the target to prevent a catastrophe, we find that in both endowment heterogeneity and double heterogeneity in endowment and loss, the vast majority of groups share the burden proportionally to the endowment ratio. This is not the case under loss heterogeneity, where burden-sharing is divided between equal contributions and proportional contribution to the loss ratio. On the bottom line, our results indicate that heterogeneity between parties is not necessarily an obstacle, but can actually facilitate public-good provision in the collective-risk social dilemma.",Challenging conventional wisdom: Experimental evidence on heterogeneity and coordination in avoiding a collective catastrophic event,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069621000747,2 July 2021,2021,Research Article,143.0

Using inpatient visit claims of two major public insurance schemes covering 47 cities in 28 provinces for three years, we see a 7.3% increase in hospital admissions on days on which the average temperature is above 27 °C, and a 2% increase in 31-day cumulative hospital admissions relative to a benchmark-temperature day in the subsequent weeks. Such an effect is much larger than evidence from developed economies. Using detailed information on medical bills, we calculate that an additional hot day nationwide is associated with approximately 2 billion yuan (roughly equivalent to 0.3 billion US dollars) increase in medical expenses that are related to inpatient services, 1.9 billion yuan (roughly equivalent to 0.29 billion US dollars) of which is borne by the public insurance system, and 0.2 billion yuan (roughly equivalent to 0.01 billion US dollars) of which is borne by the insured.","With the increasing global concern regarding climate change, the need to understand its costs on economic activities and humans has increased. Among such costs, the impact on health is crucial and attracts considerable scholarly attention. Most discussions have focused on the temperature–mortality relationship, which generally suggests an increase in mortality on extremely cold and hot days. Another aspect equally worthy of investigation is the temperature–morbidity relationship, which may impose large expenses on medical systems because of the use of hospital facilities. This paper uses inpatient visit claims from two major public insurance schemes in China to study the temperature–morbidity relationship and, in the process, provides some of the first causal evidence of such a relationship in developing countries. Moreover, the information on medical bills associated with each claim allows us to precisely estimate the extra costs to the public insurance system and individuals insured for each additional extreme temperature day.====We use a random sample of inpatient visit claims of the Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance (URBMI) and Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI) programs from 47 Chinese cities across 28 provinces; the data comprise three years' worth of detailed information on hospitalization admission dates, patients’ ages and genders, diagnosis of each visits, and billing information (i.e., total bills, bills reimbursed by insurance, copayment of the insured, and bills not covered by the insurance schemes [self-funded by the insured]). We aggregate patient visits to each city-day and merge them with temperature and other weather variables at the city-day level. Following the existing literature, 13 temperature bins are created based on the average daily temperature ranging from lower than −6 °C to above 27 °C at 3 °C increments. Using a distributed lag model accounting for the cumulative effect of each temperature bin up to a 30-day lag and adopting city-year-week and exact-date fixed effects, we study the contemporaneous and cumulative effect of each temperature bin on the hospital admission rate.====Our results suggest three main findings. First, an additional day where the average temperature is higher than 27 °C results in a 7.3% increase in hospitalization admissions, and 31-day cumulative hospital admissions increase by 2% relative to a benchmark-temperature day in the subsequent weeks. Moreover, an additional day where the average temperature is less than −6 °C results in a 3.6% increase in hospitalization admissions, and 31-day cumulative hospital admissions increase by 0.9% relative to a benchmark-temperature day in the subsequent weeks. Furthermore, we find some weak and suggestive evidence for the “harvesting” phenomenon, which is the brief temporal increase of mortality (or morbidity) among persons who are already ill/frail and at a high risk of dying (or hospitalization) (Basu and Samet, 2002), for both extremely cold and hot days.====Second, we show heterogeneity in the effect of temperature across various groups. We find that the contemporaneous and cumulative effects of extreme temperatures are stronger for adults, including the working-age population and seniors. Moreover, contemporaneous effects of extreme temperatures are similar across genders. However, the cumulative effects of extremely hot days are stronger for males, whereas those for extremely cold days appear to be stronger for females. Furthermore, regarding disease categories, the cumulative effects of cold weather are the most pronounced for neoplasms and respiratory and genitourinary diseases, whereas those for hot weather are the strongest for infectious/parasitic, nervous system, digestive, endocrine, nutritional, and metabolic diseases and immunity disorders.====Third, we estimate the impact of temperature on medical bills related to inpatient services, including bills from the two public insurance schemes and those from patients. Compared with the medical expenditure in the omitted temperature group (9°–12====C), the medical expenditure (particularly bills paid by the insured) increases by approximately 8.7% on extremely hot days (higher than 27 °C). We then use such parameters to conduct a back-of-the-envelope calculation on costs related to inpatient services borne by the public insurance system and the insured at the national level for each additional extreme temperature day. The calculations show that each additional cold (hot) day (nationwide) is associated with a 1.4 (2.0) billion ==== increase in medical bills related to inpatient services, 1.3 (1.9) and 0.2 (0.2) billion ==== of which is borne by the public insurance system and the insured, respectively.====This paper contributes to the literature on climate and health by providing the first causal estimate on temperature and morbidity by using medical claims data from a developing economy. As discussed in Dell et al. (2014), the impact of extreme weather on health can be stronger in developing countries because of the lack of adaptation mechanisms (e.g., lack of air conditioners). Our medical claims data are a representative sample of 47 cities across 28 provinces in China, including areas with various climate and economic conditions. Our estimation suggests the impact of extreme temperatures on morbidity costs in China is considerably higher than those found in the related studies in Germany and the United States, which further highlights the need for more research in developing countries to quantify the impact of climate change.====In addition, we estimate the impact of temperature on medical bills related to inpatient services separately for the public insurance scheme and the insured which has not been estimated in the previous literature on temperature and morbidity because of the lack of medical bill data for ==== claim. The data allow us to precisely quantify the monetary costs of an additional extreme temperature day on the public health system, which enables policymakers to predict the impact of climate change on public health expenditures and improve the public insurance design. Moreover, our estimates on the monetary costs of an additional extreme temperature day on the out-of-pocket expenses of the insured provide policymakers quantitative evidence to improve the design of wage subsidies paid by employers on extreme temperature days. Currently, in China, the “====”==== implemented in 2012, stipulates that if an employer has employees working in outdoors or non-air conditioned indoor environments at high temperatures (the daily maximum temperature of higher than 35 °C) and fails to take effective measures to reduce the workplace temperature to less than 33 °C, the employer then must pay their workers high-temperature subsidies. The local subsidies standard for high temperatures is formulated by the provincial government or labor security department. Therefore, the amount and timing of high-temperature subsidies vary according to regions, and the monthly subsidies range from 150 to 300 ====. The heterogeneity in our research results provides a useful reference to improving the subsidy's design based on the vulnerability of different population groups.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II discusses the related literature on temperature, mortality, and morbidity costs; Section III introduces major data sources, and Section IV describes the identification strategy and model setting; Section V discusses the primary results and the heterogeneity analysis; Section VI calculates the monetary costs associated with an additional extreme temperature day; Section VII discusses the predicted impact of climate change; and Section VIII concludes the paper.",Impact of temperature on morbidity: New evidence from China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009506962100070X,30 June 2021,2021,Research Article,144.0

However, the variability of solar and wind power leads to new challenges for power systems. Policy instruments for steering the energy transition towards a zero-carbon future must account for this. We consider an economy in which competitive firms use pollutive fossils, intermittent renewables, and storage for electricity production. A ==== is still efficient, because price fluctuations that result from intermittent renewables provide sufficient incentives to invest in storage capacities. However, governments have proved reluctant to impose carbon taxes. Therefore, we examine second-best subsidies when carbon pricing is imperfect. The optimal subsidy rate for renewables decreases as electricity production becomes less reliant on fossils. The storage subsidy is usually negative as long as fossils are dispatched while filling the storage, but turns positive thereafter. This is because more storage capacity reduces the price when stored electricity is supplied to the market, but raises it when storage adds to demand. This has countervailing effects on firms’ incentives to invest in fossil capacities. A numerical simulation illustrates that substantial subsidy payments are required even after fossils have been completely driven out of the market.","Dramatic cost reductions and substantial subsidies have created a worldwide boom of renewable energies, especially wind and solar power. In most parts of the world, they now have lower LCOE (levelised cost of electricity) than conventional fossil energies (IRENA, 2019). However, electricity from wind and solar power varies over time and depends on weather conditions. As its share rises, this intermittency becomes the dominating obstacle for transitioning to an energy system based primarily on renewables because supply must match demand at any time. For periods of low renewables availability, either a reduction of electricity demand or a back-up with fossil and/or electricity storage capacities is needed. By contrast, if their availability is high, they may produce more electricity than the market can absorb, leading to zero (or even negative) prices. For example, in Germany the number of intervals with more than six hours of negative prices more than doubled from 55 in 2016 to 123 in 2019, whereas installed wind and solar capacity increased only from 90 to 110 GW.==== This makes renewables more costly than it appears on the basis of their LCOE, and it hampers their further market penetration. While this problem is now widely acknowledged, there is little research on how renewable support policies, which were initially targeted at inducing innovation and costs reductions, have to be adjusted as renewables make up an ever increasing share of our electricity supply. This paper aims contributing to close this gap.====An obvious response to the intermittency problem are measures to reduce its extent. This includes technological improvements such as taller wind turbines and sun tracking solar panels, enhanced power transmission grids to exploit spatial differences in the availability of intermittent renewables, as well as a mix of renewable energies whose temporal variations complement each other. However, such measure will not be sufficient as renewables continue to grow. Therefore, it is widely perceived that electricity storage is an essential part of the solution. For example, IRENA (2017) calculates that electricity storage capacity need to grow from an estimated 4.67 TWh in 2017 to at least 11.89 TWh if the share of renewable energy in the energy system doubles by 2030. Such storage will probably be a mix of traditional pumped hydro storage, small- (as in electric vehicles) and large-scale batteries, power-to-gas (mainly hydrogen), and compressed air storage. Since the deployment of pumped hydro storage is limited (Gimeno-Gutiérrez and Lacal-Arántegui, 2015, Sinn, 2017), its share is projected to fall from 97% to 51% in 2030 (IRENA, 2017), and much of the build-up must come from technologies like batteries that are not competitive yet.====In this paper, we analyse the optimal policy mix for supporting renewables as well as storage to counterbalance their intermittency. In particular, we examine how these policies vary as the share of renewables grows and, thus, the extent of intermittent supply that they bring with them. For illustration, consider an initially low share of renewables. At times of high availability, they would make part of the fossil capacities redundant. In this case, adding storage capacities would absorb electricity from these idle fossil capacities and allow them to continue operating. This improves the profitability of fossils and the optimal policy intervention is a tax on storage. By contrast, once having attained a high enough share in the power system, renewables provide sufficient electricity to fill the storage. In addition, storage replaces fossil capacities as a back-up for times with low availability of renewables. The optimal policy intervention is now a subsidy for storage.====For our analysis, we build on the standard peak-load pricing model and extent it to an economy with three types of firms: those that produce with a polluting fossil energy, those that use carbon-neutral but intermittent renewable energies, and those that engage in electricity storage. We assume that intermittency follows a repetitive pattern—like a day–night cycle of solar power—and is perfectly forecastable. The latter is consistent with the empirical findings of Gowrisankaran et al. (2016) that social costs of unforecastable intermittency are small in comparison to those of intermittency overall. Moreover, short-term forecasts over a day–night cycle are quite accurate (e.g., Iversen et al., 2016), and seasonal wind availability is, at least in the historic average, well known.====First, firms make long-term investments in their respective capacities. Thereafter, they produce electricity and interact with consumers in a perfectly competitive market. Storage firms have a dual role. They buy electricity—that is, act like consumers—at the low prices that prevail during times of high availability of renewables, but supply electricity at the high prices that obtain during times of low availability. This exploitation of price differences, which we model as an optimal control problem, as well as the increasing role of flexible pricing schemes motivate our assumption of dynamic pricing.====The first policy that we consider is a Pigouvian tax per unit of carbon emissions from fossils. Given our assumptions of competitive markets, dynamic pricing, and lump-sum taxation, this instrument would implement the first-best solution; at least as long as there is no other externality such as R&D spillovers that requires a separate intervention. Since we neglect dynamic aspects of resource extraction and of the climate system, the tax would even be constant for constant marginal damage costs (see Lemoine and Rudik (2017) for dynamic taxing schemes).====However, a Pigouvian tax may not be implementable, especially due to political economy reasons.==== For example, after popular protests by the “Yellow Vests” movement the French government suspended its plans to raise the carbon tax from 44.6 €/ton in 2018 to 86.2 €/ton by 2022 (Douenne and Fabre, 2021). Indeed, most countries have relied on a mix of putting a price on carbon and extensive subsidies for renewable energies. Abrell et al. (2019a) estimate that for the period 2011–2015 the implicit abatement costs for reducing CO==== through subsidies for wind have been in the range of 105 to 276 €/ton for Germany and 82 to 258 €/ton for Spain, with even substantially larger values for solar. By contrast, the carbon price in the EU ETS was only around 5 to 10 €/ton in this period.====Therefore, our analysis focuses on subsidies for renewables and storage technologies, which reduce pollution only indirectly. First, more renewables capacities lower the expected electricity price and, thus, incentives to invest in fossils. Second, fossil capacities may remain unused when the availability of intermittent renewables, which have lower variable costs, is high. As the share of fossils in the energy system falls, these effects have less impact and the subsidy rate for renewables should be reduced.====Storage capacities even out the intermittent supply of renewables and, thereby, alleviate their main disadvantage. But this intuition for subsidising storage is flawed. If the level of renewables is efficient—as under a Pigouvian tax—the market provides sufficient incentives to exploit price variations by investing in storage. If it is inefficiently low, then directly subsidising renewables, rather than storage, is a better policy.====Nevertheless, there is a rationale for incentivising storage due to its effects on fossils. Storage reduces the electricity price when stored energy is supplied to the market, and raises it when the storage is filled. This has countervailing effects on average electricity prices and, therefore, on the incentives to invest in fossil capacities. Due to round-trip efficiency losses during a storage cycle, more electricity has to be taken from the market than can be supplied to it during times of destorage.==== Therefore, as long as fossils contribute to electricity production during times of storage, the price increasing effect dominates and storage capacities raise the profitability of fossils. Hence storage should be taxed. Once renewable capacities are sufficient to fill the storage, fossils no longer benefit from the price increasing effect and it becomes optimal to subsidise storage. This subsidy is constant until fossils are no longer used; under the same conditions that lead to a decreasing renewable subsidy. Roughly speaking, as the market share of fossil energies falls, it is optimal to gradually shift from the subsidisation of renewables to subsidising storage.====It has been argued that optimal subsidies for renewables (and storage) even implement the first-best solution, provided that they are complemented by a consumption tax (Abrell et al. 2019b, Ambec and Crampes 2019). We show that this finding does no longer hold once renewables have reached a capacity where supply at times of high availability exceeds electricity demand at a price of zero.====The analytical model is restricted to the most interesting case where all three technologies are used. However, in a numerical simulation we also consider cost parameters for which fossils are no longer employed in the efficient solution. We find that implementing this as a decentralised solution still requires substantial subsidies in order to keep fossils out of the market.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. After discussing the related literature in Section 2, we introduce the model and the timing of decisions (Section 3). We then examine electricity production and storage decisions (Section 4), capacity choices (Section 5), and policy instruments (Section 6). A numerical simulation in Section 7 illustrates and extends the results.

Artesian aquifers are a typical example of such resources since the stock never depletes, even when part of the resource is extracted. We first propose a dynamic model to account for the relevant features of such aquifers such as the water pressure and well yield and characterize the corresponding dynamics. We then compare the social optimum with the private exploitation of an open-access aquifer. The comparison of these two equilibria highlights the existence of a new source of inefficiency. In the long run, this so-called ","Common-pool resources (CPRs) have been studied extensively since the seminal papers by Gordon (1954) and Hardin (1968) in the 1950s and 1960s. Most studies have focused on how non-excludability and rivalry induce different forms of externalities. Specifically, the literature on aquifers mainly identifies ====, which create two distinct effects (Burt and Provencher, 1993): a reduction in extraction opportunities and an increase in future extraction costs. It also identifies ====, which consider the impact of the location of pumping activity on the extraction costs of neighboring wells (Brozović et al., 2010, Pfeiffer and Lin, 2012). However, both these types of externalities rely on the idea that individual withdrawal reduces the water stock available for consumption and therefore the water table (perhaps with a geographical concern), which, in turn, increases the future extraction costs for everyone (perhaps in an asymmetric way).====However , these concerns do not apply to ====, which have two particular properties. First, they are a kind of ====, which is an aquifer confined between an upper and a lower impermeable layer that recharges from a distant and more elevated aquifer that is often unconfined. Second, they have the so-called ====: water naturally flows from a well, without ====, and withdrawal from the aquifer is immediately compensated so that there is no dewatering at all. The absence of pumping and spatial externalities due to pumping therefore suggests that this resource does not suffer overexploitation under open access and needs no regulation. The main objective of our study is to show that this perception is wrong. As the artesian property of each well is linked to the global water pressure in a confined aquifer, this ==== leads, under an open-access regime, to an excessive number of wells and thereby additional costs. This result is obtained by contrasting the open-access outcome with the socially optimal equilibrium, which internalizes this externality. In other words, even through the groundwater stock within the confined aquifer does not decrease, we show that the behaviors of economic agents are not aligned with the socially optimal outcome.====Few studies on groundwater management consider the pressure externality. Since Gisser and Sanchez’s 1980 paper (Gisser and Sánchez, 1980), most researchers have continued to analyze the potential role of water management under different assumptions, but kept the focus on ====. A number of studies have compared perfect competition with socially optimal management outcomes. For instance, Provencher (1993) and Provencher and Burt (1994) respectively show that property rights allow the recovery of a large proportion of welfare gains, but that these gains remain relatively low. Allen and Gisser (1984) find a small difference between competition and social planning, while Brill and Burness (1994) find an increased divergence between both scenarios under different hydrological and economic assumptions, including demand growth, declining well yields, and low social discount rates. Other studies contrast the social planner solution with strategic behaviors (Negri, 1989, Rubio and Casino, 2001). Rubio and Casino (2001), for instance, confirm Gisser and Sánchez’s 1980 result. Some studies expand on this in a number of directions, including examining uncertainty (Knapp and Olson, 1995, Tsur and Graham-Tomasi, 1991), conjunctive surface water use (Azaiez, 2002, Stahn and Tomini, 2016, Stahn and Tomini, 2017), and water quality management (Roseta-Palma, 2003). Nevertheless, all these works assume that an aquifer behaves as a “bathtub” with perfect hydraulic conductivity and is only subject to atmospheric pressure. The water level is therefore constant across the aquifer and equal to the potentiometric surface.==== The dynamics of these “single cell” and unconfined aquifers can be summarized by changes in the water level, and since water disposal requires, in this case, pumping, their users share a common part in their current cost function: the cost of the water lift.====Spatial externalities are mainly based on the location of the pumping activity or final users. Chakravorty and Roumasset (1991), Chakravorty and Umetsu (2003), and Pongkijvorasin and Roumasset (2007) stress final-user heterogeneity by linking the water conveyance lost/cost to the distance to the water source, while Pitafi and Roumasset (2009) focus on users located at different elevations. Other studies look at the limitations of the bathtub assumption due to spatially differentiated hydrological components (Katic and Grafton, 2012). They borrow elements from the hydrologic literature on imperfect transmissivity,==== such as Darcy’s law (Darcy, 1856), which describes the water flow in a porous medium, and Theis’ analysis (Theis, 1938) of the depression cone induced by pumping. Brozović et al. (2010) and Merrill and Guilfoos (2018) build on Theis’ approach and relate the marginal cost of the water lift at a given location to the pumping histories and distances of other wells. This modifies the strength of the externality and potential gain from regulation, but remains, nevertheless, a pumping externality. Other strands of the literature consider multi-aquifer (or multi-cell) systems with water exchanges between these aquifers (or cells). The porosity between cells is governed by Darcy’s law. Exchanges mostly take place between lateral aquifers (or cells) and induce spatial externalities (e.g., Saak and Peterson (2007), Peterson and Saak (2018), Pfeiffer and Lin (2012), Athanassoglou et al. (2012), and Manning and Suter (2019)). However, as long as there is pumping in each cell, it remains a pumping externality, although the magnitude may vary across space. Indeed, the implicit water price for a given cell (i.e., the co-state variable associated with this cell) is linked to the water prices of other cells.====Spatial externalities are different if we compare ==== aquifers. Theis ’ argument (Theis, 1938) on depression cones is based on confined aquifers, even though it can also, to an extent, be applied to unconfined aquifers (see Appendix 2 of Brozović et al. (2010)). Darcy’s law, which describes the flow resulting from imperfect transmissivity between aquifers, is not restricted to lateral flows and therefore does not necessarily induce spatial externalities. For instance, Gisser and Mercado (1972) consider a confined and an unconfined aquifer (the Pecos River Basin aquifer), the former being located below the latter, with vertical flows governed by Darcy’s law. By contrast, Worthington et al. (1985) consider a two-part aquifer (the Crow Creek Valley aquifer), one part confined and the other unconfined, but nevertheless with perfect transmissivity. The primary argument of these authors is that confined aquifers are under pressure, which explains why, for instance, water can flow upward, according to Gisser and Mercado (1972). In fact, the main difference between confined and unconfined aquifers is that the water table is different from the potentiometric line. With confined aquifer systems, users share not only a common stock but also a common pressure, both being affected by individual withdrawals. Similarly, Reinelt (2020) considers an aquifer system composed of an unconfined recharge area, a confined aquifer that obtains water from the recharge area, and a discharge area for the confined aquifer, at sea level, with possible saline intrusions. Modeling the change in the potentiometric surface due to pumping in a spatio-dynamical setting, he derives an optimal water extraction strategy. In doing so, he captures both the standard marginal pumping cost externality in the unconfined aquifer and the spatial externalities within the confined aquifer and between the confined and unconfined aquifers, as well as the externalities induced by saline intrusion. However, he observes that the global marginal pumping cost externalities are different in the unconfined and confined aquifers because the latter consumes the water pressure and water volume.====Our study starts with a different rationale, that is, we isolate this pressure externality. The best option is to consider aquifers for which water consumption requires no pumping at all. This is typically the case for artesian aquifers—confined aquifers that obtain their recharge from an unconfined area but whose potentiometric surface is above ground level. In this case, the pressure is sufficiently strong to ensure that water naturally flows over the top of a drilling well without the need for pumping. Water yields are, nevertheless, dependent on the pressure of the confined aquifer, and when a new well is drilled, the pressure of the whole aquifer decreases, which consequently exerts a negative externality on the yields of existing wells. We refer to this as the “pressure externality”, which requires managing the overall number of wells.====Artesian aquifers can be found in many countries. The Great Artesian Basin in Australia is considered as the largest and deepest in the world, underlying 22% of the continent. Other important systems are the Edwards Aquifer in Texas, USA and the Northern Sahara Aquifer System in northern Africa. There are also artesian wells south of Vancouver, Canada and in several places in India, providing water for millions of people. Nevertheless, this resource is subject to the “rule of capture”and is thus threatened by human pressure. Moreover, in many of the wells, the flow is still uncontrolled. As such, optimizing the exploitation of this resource and production of groundwater reservoirs is a difficult challenge. Regulations have already been implemented in some areas to limit adverse impacts. For instance, the St. Johns River Water Management District in Florida encourages well owners to control the flow and even abandon problematic wells by plugging them.====In this paper, we present a simple hydro-economic dynamic model of a confined artesian aquifer. To emphasize the pressure externality, we restrict our analysis to free-flowing artesian wells====: water is obtained by drilling a hole without any pumping and therefore without any pumping externalities. We also assume perfect transmissivity between the recharge area and confined aquifer to avoid any spatial externalities. Water yields are therefore driven only by the evolution of the water pressure in the aquifer over time. Specifically, we use fluid dynamics to describe the relationship between the water stock, water pressure, and water discharge. On this basis, we first assume that this resource operates under an open-access regime. Second, we introduce an optimal management problem for the number of wells that takes into account this pressure externality. For both management regimes, we characterize the long-run steady-state values and their properties with respect to changes in the economic and hydrological parameters of the model. We then compare these two management regimes by introducing two rates that capture the main differences. The first rate measures the yield losses per well compared with the optimal management case, while the second rate measures the rate of increase in the long-run water cost. These rates act as proxies for the loss of pressure and social cost of overextraction, respectively. This approach allows us to challenge the Gisser–Sanchez effect since our welfare gain can be large. We also analyze the sensitivity of these rates to the economic and hydrological parameters of the model and propose a state-dependent tax that aligns the open-access steady state with the optimal management. We finally discuss potential extensions concerning farmer behavior and technology choices, especially the richer water policy induced by non-myopic behavior, the limitations of our entry mechanism, and the possibility to supplement free water harvesting by pumping.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The specific features of an artesian aquifer, particularly the consequences of the water pressure model, are presented in Section 2. Section 3 presents the main economic characteristics of our system and analyzes the short- and long-run properties of this hydro-economic model under open access. Section 4 analyzes the centralized water management problem and Section 5 describes the long-run properties of this optimal management. Section 6 contrasts these two regimes in terms of pressure losses and social costs. Section 7 discusses further extensions and Section 8 concludes.

In this paper, we explore how a stay-at-home (SAH) order impacted one aspect of behavior: the demand for water. Using a unique panel dataset of property-level water usage in Henderson, Nevada, we analyze changes in water usage from the SAH order, finding an initial and continuous decline in average daily usage for commercial and school users. In contrast, we find an initial increase in consumption by residential users with this effect increasing over time. Aggregated across all users, the SAH order led to an increase in net water usage between 32 and 59 million gallons over the first 30 days.","In response to the outbreak of the global COVID-19 pandemic, society dramatically shifted the way in which people consume, educate, and work. Urged to stay-at-home (SAH) and practice social distancing by political and public health officials, consumer spending radically changed with a shift toward necessities and a substantial decline in luxury items (====). The economy shifted toward embracing remote work, with an estimated half of workers employed pre-pandemic operating from home (====) with substantial increases in unemployment filings for those unable to do so (====). When combined, these myriad factors point to a new reality: more people are in their homes for more hours than ever before. This means that household resource utilization – electricity, natural gas, and water usage – are likely affected by this societal change. At the same time, these same factors may lead one to expect, a priori, a fall in resource utilization by non-residential users. These observations raise several important empirical questions: firstly, how is the COVID-19 pandemic re-shaping resource utilization for residential and non-residential users? Second, if there exists an asymmetric pandemic response across users, what is the aggregate utilization change?====In this paper, we seek to understand household utilization of one key resource subsequent to COVID-19: water. To mitigate the possibility that water consumption patterns are driven by geography – specifically the relative abundance/scarcity of water – we study water usage in Henderson, Nevada, a large desert city with existing societal preferences for conservation. Nevada enacted a SAH order on March 17, 2020 with a gradual reopening starting May 9, 2020.====While there is a rich literature on estimating water demand (====; ====; ====; ====; among others) and a burgeoning literature on responses to pricing and conservation efforts (====; ====; ====; ====; ====), less work exists studying the responsiveness of water demand to a crisis like COVID-19. It is natural to hypothesize there may be a response, as psychology research suggests a strong linkage between mood and consumer decision-making (====) in addition to research suggesting significant behavioral changes following crises or disasters (====; ====).==== Our major contribution is in uncovering how water demand changes in response to the pandemic and providing econometrically sound estimates of the heterogenous effects to the SAH order that has important water conservation implications.====We exploit the panel nature of our data and model average daily water usage at the property-by-water-billing level before and after the SAH order was implemented compared against the typical water usage from the same periods in previous years. We use property-specific and year fixed effects to control for as many household or temporal drivers of water consumption as feasibly possible. We find water usage by residential users initially increased by 11.7–13.1% during the first month following the stay-at-home period, which we attribute to behavioral changes induced by the pandemic. Commercial usage decreased by 34.1–35.7% while schools fell by 55.8–66.2%, consistent with the effects of the SAH closure on these user types. Aggregating across all users, we find the SAH order led to an increase in net water usage between 32 and 59 million gallons over the first 30 days. To put these effects in context, this equates to a 1.8–3.3% increase in monthly per capita water usage, respectively.====These findings have important policy implications across two distinct fronts. First, as remote work becomes increasingly commonplace, policymakers may need to renew their efforts at promoting conservation, especially amongst users in higher-income areas who are not as water price sensitive. Secondly, the locational re-sorting motivated by COVID-19 is likely to see continued migration from coastal cities to inland areas, especially cities in the Western United States, which already face significant water constraints. Developing the appropriate policies to educate new residents on sustainable water usage will be of paramount importance especially in an uncertain climatic future with potentially dire ==== in the future.====We proceed as follows: we describe our study area and data in Section II, our empirical model and results in Sections III and IV, respectively before discussing the overall findings in Section V and conclude in Section VI.",Water in the time of corona(virus): The effect of stay-at-home orders on water demand in the desert,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009506962100067X,18 June 2021,2021,Research Article,147.0

Far from unidimensional, air pollution is multifaceted, but quasi-experimental studies have been struggling to grasp the consequences of the multiple hazards. By selecting optimal instruments from a novel and large set of altitude–weather ====, we disentangle the impact of five air pollutants in a comprehensive assessment of their short-term health impact in the largest urban areas of France over 2010–2015. We find that higher levels of at least two air pollutants, ozone and sulfur dioxide, lead to more respiratory-related emergency admissions. Children and elderly are mostly affected. Carbon monoxide increases emergency admissions for cardiovascular diseases while particulate matter is found responsible for increasing the cardiovascular-related mortality rate, and sulfur dioxide the respiratory-related mortality rate. Assuming a five air pollutants context, we show that an analyst who ignored the presence of interrelations between air pollutants would have reached partially false conclusions.","To protect human health, urban environmental regulations increasingly rely on ambient pollutant concentrations both to inform and take actions. Thanks to the high frequency monitoring systems in place in large cities, local authorities may implement driving restrictions, impose lower speed limits or ban industrial activities when a pollutant concentration exceeds a regulatory threshold. The avoided damage when concentrations fall are central to the design of these environmental policies, first and foremost damage from the respective health impacts of pollutants forming the urban air pollution mixture. Whereas recent quasi-experimental evidence relative to global air quality is clear-cut, disentangling the effect of distinct air pollutants has been a long-discussed challenge. While having received considerable attention, it remains a key difficulty in observational studies. In the discussions for updating the global air quality guidelines, the World Health Organization has set “Causality and independence of effects including multi-pollutant effect estimates as a basis for joint health impact assessment” as a key point for debate, highlighting the relevance of describing and regulating jointly several pollutants (WHO, 2018).====In this paper, we conduct a large-scale quasi-experimental study of the short-term concomitant effects of five air pollutants on morbidity and mortality in the largest urban areas of France over 2010–2015. We address the challenge posed by the highly correlated daily variations of air pollutants by leveraging a novel and large set of instruments which describe extensively altitude–weather conditions e.g. winds or temperature profiles. By mining predictive relationships to find instruments for each air pollutant separately, we disentangle the concomitant effects of the main pollutants of the urban mixture. Our first contribution is to provide causal evidence on the separate effects of five air pollutants on short-term cardiovascular and respiratory morbidity and mortality, in the real urban environment, while controlling for the other pollutants. Our second contribution is to suggest a novel set of instruments which allows precise estimations when leveraged with the IV-Lasso method by Belloni et al. (2012).====Concerns about extrapolating associational estimates have been voiced insistently (Currie et al., 2011, Dominici et al., 2014, Bind, 2019), but causal estimation remains challenging. Air pollution is not allocated randomly through time and space and may serve as a surrogate for a number of economic and population variables (e.g. traffic, industrial activities, bank holidays...), therefore the well-known challenge to isolate exogenous air pollution variations, even at high frequency. While causal estimates are considered as the gold standard to inform public policies, quasi-experimental studies are still scarce, and typically not able to isolate a given pollutant effect, but rather a cocktail of several ingredients. To identify air pollution effects, the quasi-experimental literature has been very creative in finding external shocks affecting air pollution independently of health outcomes. Authors have taken advantage of plausibly exogenous shocks such as airport congestion (Schlenker and Walker, 2015), daily boat traffic (Moretti and Neidell, 2011), changes in local traffic (Currie and Walker, 2011, Knittel et al., 2016, Simeonova et al., 2018) or recession (Chay and Greenstone, 2003). The nature of the shocks underpinning the estimations entails quasi-random variations of air quality — but not pollutant-specific variations.====Car traffic engender emissions of particulate matter, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides as primary pollutants, and indirectly ozone, a secondary pollutant formed from primary sources. A lower economic activity entails a slowdown in emissions from industry, reducing among other sulfur dioxide and particulate matter. Pollutant concentrations often vary together as they share some common sources, but approximating air pollution by a unidimensional phenomenon might be questionable, not least because some air pollutants are strongly anti-correlated due to chemical equilibrium. As a result, studies relying on these global sources of variations are not well suited to separate the causal effect of distinct air pollutants. Some recent studies resort to finding exogenous shocks specific to one pollutant e.g. Halliday et al. (2019) who use volcano eruptions whose chemical composition is very specific, hence justifying a single-pollutant model. Using change in wind directions as instruments, Deryugina et al. (2019) show that the PM2.5 impact on elderly mortality is more robust than that of other pollutants, instrumenting jointly for three pollutants (particular matter, carbon monoxide and ozone). Yet a broader set of instruments may increase the ability to separate the impact of more air pollutants — showing that not only PMs may be impacting daily mortality. In contrast, most of the existing literature is based on single-pollutant models and authors generally acknowledge that the given pollutant under study may serve as a surrogate for another.====In parallel, the emergence of novel econometric and data science techniques has fostered the hope that the causal effects of each air pollutant could be more precisely estimated (Carone et al., 2020). In this spirit, a number of studies intend to explore multi-pollutant exposure consequences with random forest or clustering over pollution profiles but remain ultimately correlative evidence (Zanobetti et al., 2014, Bobb et al., 2015, Tavallali et al., 2020). This paper moves beyond both literature by using a wide set of physical instruments allowing to separate the impact of five air pollutants in a quasi-experimental setting and over a broad set of outcomes. We here observe and consider simultaneously six long-regulated hazardous pollutants which have been the focus of the first and often-revised national and international standards for protecting human health: particulate matter of less than 2.5 micrometers PM2.5, of less than 10 micrometers PM10, carbon monoxide CO, nitrogen dioxide NO2, ozone O3 and sulfur dioxide SO2. On a relatively small sample, we bridge the gap between on one hand, quasi-experimental studies which often lacked sufficiently distinct exogenous shocks to disentangle air pollutant effects, and on the other hand, associational studies using data-mining techniques within multi-pollutant models.====For this study, we use a novel and large set of instruments, altitude–weather variables: thermal inversions, planetary boundary layer height, altitude winds and altitude pressures derived from a general climate model — the LMDZ model, from the ====.==== We exploit the richness of a great number of instrumental variables to predict each pollutant variation. Indeed, the atmosphere dynamics, such as wind effects, plays a key role in the mixing, the chemistry and the dispersion of urban air pollution and thus in the ambient air pollution inhaled by the population. The exclusion restriction for this type of IV strategy is that, after largely and flexibly controlling for surface weather variables and city-specific seasonal fixed effects, changes in altitude–weather variables are unrelated to changes in population health outcomes except through their influence on air pollutant concentrations. The specification includes very flexible month-by-year-by-city fixed effects and day-of-the-week-by-city fixed effects, so the estimates are identified from deviations within month–year–city cells on similar week days,==== and we control for daily temperature, humidity, precipitations and wind strength specified as polynomials of order two, and sunlight and presence of snow. Controlling for surface weather is important inasmuch as they have a direct effect on health and are correlated to our instruments, so a number of robustness checks to the main specification are examined. Individually, some of these instruments have been used to instrument a unidimensional air pollution component. Arceo et al., 2016, Jans et al., 2018, Chen et al., 2018 and Sager (2019) rely on thermal inversions, an inversion of the gradient of vertical temperature profiles which favors polluted conditions. Deryugina et al. (2019) and Anderson (2019) use wind characteristics. Schwartz et al. (2016) use surface wind speed and the planetary boundary layer height, a key driver of ground-level air quality although still under-used in the literature.====To derive pollutant-specific causal effects, we use optimal instrument selection among a high-dimensional set of altitude weather variables, relying on the econometric theory by Belloni et al., 2012, Belloni et al., 2016 and Chernozhukov et al. (2015).==== These recent techniques allow us to select instruments in an optimal way, avoiding ad-hoc selection and enhancing precision in a setting where it is decisively needed. Compared to the literature drawing causal inference from the unpredictable components of weather variations, the originality here is to use a large set of altitude–weather conditions as opposed to a sub-component, and let the data reveal the underlying strongest relationships. We may indeed find many other and more complex phenomena linking altitude–weather variables to ground-level pollution by leveraging the rich set of instruments at hand. Isolating different exogenous reasons for each pollutant variation with an IV-Lasso, we prove the empirical added-value of these recent high-dimensional econometric methods, whose applications are too often confined to repeating the existing analysis. Indeed, it is in practice very rare to rely on a naturally-large set of instruments.====This study contributes to the recent literature in economics which estimates the health effects of air pollution in quasi-experimental settings (Currie et al., 2011, Schlenker and Walker, 2015, Deryugina et al., 2019). We combine daily air pollutant concentration data with administrative data on location-specific daily mortality and emergency hospital admissions for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases across age-groups. These data cover over six years (2010–2015) the ten largest urban areas of France, where about 40% of the French population lives. Our results show that ozone and sulfur dioxide impact positively emergency admissions for respiratory diseases, independently from each other and even after controlling for the other pollutants. Quantitatively, we find 4% more respiratory admissions when O3 goes up by ＋ 10 ==== (about half a standard deviation) and 7% more respiratory admissions when SO2 goes up by ＋ 1 ==== (two-third of a standard deviation). These aggregate effects are mostly driven by emergency admissions of young children and elderly. Although not in all specifications, some of the models suggest an additional impact of carbon monoxide on respiratory emergency admissions. On cardiovascular diseases, we find an impact of carbon monoxide: ＋ 100 ==== (about half a standard deviation) leads to 4% additional emergency admissions. Moreover, we find an effect of PM2.5 on cardiovascular-related mortality: ＋ 10 ==== (about a standard deviation) leads to a 5% higher mortality rate for deaths with at least one cardiovascular cause (or a 2% increase in the mortality rate). An increase by ＋ 1 ==== of SO2 translates to a 10% higher mortality rate for deaths with at least one respiratory cause (or a 2% increase in the mortality rate). These short-term health effect estimates are significant even when controlling the family-wise error rate of at least one false rejection out of the five hypothesis tests (one per candidate pollutant).====Our last contribution is to shed light on the shortcomings of single-pollutant models compared to multi-pollutant models, by providing an extensive comparison of the results in both paradigms. If most pollutants can be found as having a strong causal effect on short-term health in single-pollutant models, multi-pollutant models offer a more nuanced picture. In single-pollutant models, there may be pollutants acting as surrogate for the others, entailing misleading conclusions. For all outcomes, we reject the equality of estimates from single-pollutant IVs with these of a multi-pollutant IV-Lasso. When instruments are specifically chosen for each pollutant, we reject equality between single and multi-pollutant models for mortality outcomes. These results may question the proxy paradigm which often is the rule in empirical analysis. For instance, if NO2 has been advocated as a good candidate to proxy for all pollutants in Levy et al. (2014), we find no effect of this pollutant (at short-term) when other pollutants enter the equation. In addition, controlling for four other pollutants and selecting optimally the instruments allow to eliminate the odd finding that O3 leads to a ==== in mortality or emergency admissions. This spurious result is usually explained by the strong negative correlation that this pollutant has with other pollutants.====More generally, our results tie into the literature intending to design policy instruments in a multi-pollutant context e.g. Montero, 2001, Ambec and Coria, 2013, Fullerton and Karney, 2018. Rich economic valuation of environmental policies taking several major pollutants into account, such as Holland et al. (2018) or Clay et al. (2019), substantially rely on integrated assessment models where the health impact measurement is a key step, and is taken from studies which generally use the proxy approach. This paper contributes to quantifying the respective marginal benefit in reducing distinct pollutants, in a context of increasing interest in regulating air pollutants jointly. In addition, our result put into question the current implementation of Air Quality Indexes, which are generally specified as maximum over pollutant sub-indexes, ruling out concomitant effects. Real-time AQI information about air pollution has been shown critical for defensive investment and protective behavior (Neidell, 2009, Zhang and Mu, 2018, Barwick et al., 2019).====The article proceeds as follows. In the second section, we introduce background information on pollutants, estimation of health impacts and on pollutants’ interaction with weather conditions. In the third section, we present jointly the data and the mechanisms at work. Then, we present and discuss the empirical strategy and the instruments’ selection procedure in the fourth section. Finally, we present our results and then conclude.",Disentangling the effects of air pollutants with many instruments,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069621000668,15 June 2021,2021,Research Article,148.0

Previous work has studied sector-specific impacts following air quality regulations, or examined overall employment effects of land-use policies. In the case of the protection of the Northern Spotted Owl under the Endangered Species Act in 1990, millions of acres of highly productive federal timberland in the Pacific Northwest and northern California were set aside. Concerns regarding declining employment in the timber ==== following the listing are often mentioned as a cautionary tale regarding future listings under the Act. However, disentangling the policy impact from other economic factors affecting employment such as recessions and sector-specific trends is challenging. We use a range of control groups to estimate the impact of the 1990 listing of the Northern Spotted Owl had on labor market outcomes in the Lumber and Wood Products sector. Our set of main results indicate long-run declines in timber ==== employment of 13.9% using a regional perspective, 28.1% using a national perspective, and a 9.5% decline in the number of establishments. In the owl habitat range there were 114,600 timber employees in the pre-treatment period; about 1.4% of total employment in those counties. In terms of jobs, the declines represent around 16,000 or 32,000 timber jobs within the Pacific Northwest and northern California. We find heterogeneous effects with areas having larger shares of protected federal timberland experiencing larger declines in employment. Our findings indicate land protection policies may pose significant employment impacts to land-reliant industries.","Environmental policy often requires placing restrictions on the use of land, particularly for conservation efforts aiming to protect threatened or endangered wildlife, or ecological systems. Land protection is a primary policy tool for the Endangered Species Act (ESA), through its listing process of species and designation of critical habitats. Species protection has broad social benefits, nationally, and addresses the market failure associated with the unpriced social benefits of species. However, the costs are concentrated and borne by affected groups, such as private landowners (Brown and Shogren, 1998). Social benefits can be broader than whether a specific species itself is recovering, and conceptually include the associated benefits of multiple valuable ecosystem functions provided by protected land, including habitat for numerous other species, watershed protection, recreation and amenity values, among others (Innes and Frisvold, 2009, Ando and Langpap, 2018). Opportunity costs of the ESA include foregone opportunities for land use, reduced economic rents from delayed development projects, agricultural production, timber harvesting, mineral extraction, foregone wages of displaced workers, lower consumer surplus from higher prices, and lower asset values (Brown and Shogren, 1998, Rubin et al., 1991). Restrictions on land use can result in distributional consequences, with positive and negative economic impacts, affecting some groups more than others. For example, restrictions may burden land-reliant economic sectors, affected workers, and communities. Conversely, land restrictions may create or enhance natural amenities that attract new residents, new recreational activities, and increase local economic activity, including employment. A key distributional concern with respect to environmental policy is the effect it has on labor market outcomes, such as employment impacts (Walker, 2013, Smith, 2015, Deschenes, 2018).====Our study examines the employment impacts of a policy that shifted productive federal timberland in the Pacific Northwest and northern California into environmental conservation: protection of the Northern Spotted Owl (NSO) in 1990 under the ESA. Apart from the expected benefits to the owls and other forest species, the timber industry was expected be the most affected, economically (Rubin et al., 1991). Industry members argued that land use restrictions would reduce timber harvest and negatively impact timber jobs. At the time, predictions varied and were highly-debated, especially in the communities where the sector was economically important (Montgomery et al., 1994, Meyer, 1997, Goodstein, 1999). We focus on timber employment, using spatial data on habitat ranges to estimate changes in industry employment levels, wages, and numbers of establishments, attributable to NSO protection. Throughout the different comparisons we make in the analysis, we find that the 1990 NSO listing negatively impacted employment in the Lumber and Wood Products sector. Our estimates of declines, relative to two comparison groups, are centered around 16,000 or 32,000 timber jobs within the Pacific Northwest and northern California. These are similar to the government projections from the time of the listing, and are not as large as the industry studies’ projections of about 100,000 jobs lost.====The 1990 ESA listing of the NSO as ‘threatened’ necessitated the designation of critical habitat areas within the species range, which is primarily old-growth forest, in the Pacific Northwest and northern California (Fish & Wildlife Service, 1990). Prior to the listing, legal injunctions and negotiations led to the 1989 “Northwest Compromise”, which restricted logging in the NSO habitat range (Thomas et al., 1990). Controversially, 6.9 million acres of timberland were designated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) in 1992 as critical habitat, with timber harvesting restrictions (Fish & Wildlife Service, 1992). The impact on timber harvests in the region was dramatic, with declines of 87 percent in national forests and 38 percent overall in the region from 1988 to 1996 (Daniels, 2005). Responding to escalating tensions between environmentalists and industry, President Clinton and Vice-President Gore held a town-hall meeting on April 2, 1993, in Portland, Oregon, listening to concerned parties (Hoberg, 2004). The 1994 Northwest Forest Plan was the policy solution to protect the NSO on federal land in Oregon, Washington and California (Tuchmann et al., 1996, Fish and Wildlife Service, 1994). Most recently, in 2020, the ESA NSO listing as ‘threatened’ was reexamined, reclassification to ‘endangered’ was found to be warranted, but precluded by higher priority ESA actions (Fish and Wildlife Service, 2020). In January 2021, NSO critical habitat areas were dramatically reduced by 3.4 million acres (Fish and Wildlife Service, 2021), though this regulation will be reviewed by the incoming administration (White House, 2021).====Our analysis of timber industry employment impacts from NSO protection connects the literature of labor impacts of environmental regulation, and the literature on the impacts of land conservation on economic growth. There are now an increasing number of studies estimating employment impacts of environmental regulations, e.g. for industries and workers directly affected by compliance costs for air pollution regulations (Berman and Bui, 2001, Greenstone, 2002, Walker, 2013, Ferris et al., 2014, Curtis, 2018, Hafstead and Williams, 2018, Sheriff et al., 2019, Curtis, 2020). However, studies of the economic impacts of land conservation focus on local economic growth, with amenity-driven effects and employment effects for all industries (Chen et al., 2016, Melstrom et al., 2018, Ando and Langpap, 2018, Jakus and Akhundjanov, 2018, Sims et al., 2019, Walls et al., 2020).====Our paper contributes to the existing literature examining NSO protections and their impacts on employment, in the timber industry, both regionally and nationally. Because the NSO listing and designation of NSO critical habitat areas arguably had both regional and national impacts, we consider both a regional framework focused only on the Pacific Northwest and California, as well as a national framework, for the continental U.S., and report estimates from both perspectives. We utilize empirical approaches and techniques from the labor literature to estimate a causal relationship between timber employment levels and land protections for the NSO. In 1990, the federal government projected the economic impacts of NSO protection and estimated job losses in the Lumber and Wood Products sector would range between 13,000 jobs in the near term and 28,000 jobs in the long-run (USDA-USDI, 1990, Rubin et al., 1991, Flora, 2003). In the years after the listing, studies examined how the NSO listing and other policies restricting timber harvests in the 1990s impacted timber markets, but did not also focus on timber employment (Murray and Wear, 1998, Wear and Murray, 2004a, Rucker et al., 2005, Daigneault et al., 2016). To examine impacts of the 1990 NSO listing on employment, other studies used ex-post data for overall employment, or specific to the timber sector, but without utilizing a control group strategy to help account for potential confounders occurring at the same time as the 1990 listing. Events such as the early 1990s recession, technological changes in the industry, as well as shifting timber harvesting activity into the Southeastern U.S., and increasing exposure to foreign competition were not well-accounted for in previous studies (Freudenburg et al., 1998, Carroll et al., 1999, Helvoigt et al., 2003, Berck et al., 2003, Charnley et al., 2006a, Phillips, 2006, Eichman et al., 2010).====We focus on a time period from 1984 to 2000, with years of data available before and after the 1990 policy. To assign counties to our treatment and control groups, we use spatial data on the NSO’s habitat range, and consider a number of different control groups. We define our treatment group as the counties in California, Oregon, and Washington that are within 25 km of the NSO habitat range, where statutory protections from the 1990 listing apply uniformly. We utilize a range of control groups to address the regional and national perspectives, a number of potential economic confounders in the early 1990s, concerns about leakage or spillovers if timber activity responded to the policy by moving away from treatment and into control counties, and also issues of data suppression in county-level data. In the national analysis, our first control group is comprised of counties in the continental U.S., outside of CA, OR, and WA. In this first specification, we omit counties within CA, OR, and WA that are not in the treatment group. We exclude these counties as we consider them to be the most susceptible to leakage within the region. Our second control group is focused regionally, examining impacts on local labor and timber markets, and we include only those counties in CA, OR, and WA at least 100 km away from the NSO habitat range. This effectively drops from our regional analysis those counties directly neighboring treatment counties. Our final assignment of treatment and control groups is at the state-level, repeating the national analysis but using data that are not subject to suppression issues with county-level data. Our results reflect a range of estimates across these different comparison groups. Using different sub-samples of the data, we test for potential leakage and spillovers across timber labor markets and do not find evidence that our results are driven by a simple shift in the location of employment.====Quasi-experimental methods treat policy changes as natural experiments and are commonly used in the literature that studies how air pollution regulations impact employment in affected sectors. Our empirical focus is to disentangle the reduction in labor demand in the timber industry following the 1990 listing of the NSO, from cyclical economic conditions, and ongoing sector-specific trends, to identify the causal effect of NSO protection. We use three different strategies: difference-in-differences (DD) for timber employment in treatment relative to control counties, pre- and post-policy; triple differences (DDD) with an added comparison to overall employment, or to timber sector employment in Canada; and a synthetic control method (SCM) that uses a weighted control group that is more similar to the treatment group.====The results in this paper use a range of control groups to study how timber industry employment changed as a result of NSO protection. In the national comparison, following the 1990 listing up to 2000 we find that in the long-run, timber employment declined by 28.1%, and the number of establishments dropped by 9.5% in the treated counties, relative to the time period between 1984 and 1989. In the regional comparison, we find a smaller relative timber employment decline of 13.9%. When translated into jobs, these reductions reflect a decline in the treated counties, for 1990 to 2000, of about 32,000 jobs in the Lumber and Wood Products sector when compared nationally, or 16,000 jobs within the region. This estimate is in the lower range of previously projected job losses made around the time of the listing (Goodstein, 1999). Interestingly, it is in agreement with the USFS - USDOI projection of around 28,000 timber jobs lost in the region in the long-run and 13,000 jobs in the short-run (Flora, 2003), also referenced in the cover article of Time Magazine in 1990 (Gup, 1990). The county-level DDD results, using overall county employment as the third difference, are comparable to the DD estimates for timber employment impacts, but the decline in the number of establishments is more than double than in the DD results. Results using timber employment data from Canada as our third difference are similar to our DD and DDD results for employment impacts.====To place our estimates in context, prior to the 1990 NSO listing, from 1984–89, there were approximately 168,500 employees in the timber industry (SIC 24) within the Pacific NW and California, representing a small percentage of state employment: 0.3% (CA), 3.1% (OR), and 1.1% (WA). For the treated counties, on average, SIC 24 employment involved 114,600 timber jobs. From this baseline, our estimated impact of 16,000 timber jobs, from a regional perspective, and 32,000 timber jobs from a national perspective, represent approximately 14% to 28% of timber industry employment, in the counties within 25 km of the NSO habitat range.====Our study contributes to the literature examining employment impacts of the 1990 NSO listing (Freudenburg et al., 1998, Carroll et al., 1999, Helvoigt et al., 2003, Berck et al., 2003, Charnley et al., 2006a, Phillips, 2006, Eichman et al., 2010). ==== analyses have used methods without control groups, and find a range of estimates: Freudenburg et al. (1998) find no significant impact on jobs, Carroll et al. (1999) find approximately 20,000 wood products jobs lost (SIC 24 & 26) in Oregon from 1988–1995, and Eichman et al. (2010) estimate 88,259 jobs lost: total employment, not just timber employment, in CA, OR, WA from 1994–2003. A USFS study estimated 11,800 timber industry jobs lost due to owl protection in the NWFP area from 1990–2000 (Charnley et al., 2006b). Berck et al. (2003) focus on timber-dependent counties only in northern California and estimate economic impacts on local communities, specifically timber employment and poverty indicators.====In our use of comparison groups, we draw on studies of employment impacts of environmental regulation (Berman and Bui, 2001, Greenstone, 2002, Walker, 2013, Ferris et al., 2014, Curtis, 2018, Hafstead and Williams, 2018, Sheriff et al., 2019, Curtis, 2020), as well as studies of the economic impacts of land conservation (Chen et al., 2016, Melstrom et al., 2018, Ando and Langpap, 2018, Jakus and Akhundjanov, 2018, Sims et al., 2019, Walls et al., 2020). Using similar quasi-experimental methods, like DD and DDD, estimates of employment impacts range from significant negative impacts such as approximately 590,000 manufacturing jobs over 15 years for the 1977 Clean Air Act (Greenstone, 2002), or a loss of 110,000 jobs in energy-intensive manufacturing in the eastern U.S. due to the NOx Budget Trading Program (Curtis, 2018), to estimated zero impacts on manufacturing employment from the 2004 ozone NAAQS (air quality regulations) (Curtis, 2020), local air quality regulations in southern California (Berman and Bui, 2001), or power plant employment after Title IV of 1990 Clean Air Act (Ferris et al., 2014).====Compared to previous studies, our work is closest to Eichman et al. (2010), Melstrom et al. (2018), and Curtis (2020), but also differs in notable ways. We explore the impact of NSO protection, as in Eichman et al. (2010), and focus on employment impacts using methods from the labor literature on environmental regulation, as in Curtis (2020). We focus on a single industry, Lumber and Wood Products (SIC 24), with the aim of quantifying employment impacts for this heavily impacted sector. The outcome of interest in our analysis is the gross impact on timber industry employment. This departs from previous studies that examined net employment for all industries in local communities in the NSO region, including positive impacts of amenities (Eichman et al., 2010). While Eichman et al. (2010) use empirical techniques common in the regional economics literature (Lewis et al., 2002), we use DD, which is often used in studies estimating labor impacts of environmental regulations (Greenstone, 2002, Walker, 2013, Curtis, 2018, Curtis, 2020). Finally, Eichman et al. (2010) estimate the long-run employment effect (1994–2003), without also quantifying the transitional employment impacts (1990–1994). Melstrom et al. (2018) study the effects of listing the lesser prairie chicken on employment using a DD estimator, but focus on overall regional employment. Curtis (2020) uses DD and DDD to examine the impact of an air quality regulation, the 2004 National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone, on employment in the affected manufacturing sector. Our study also differs in how we test for spillover effects, as well as how we account for potential data quality issues related to suppressed data reporting at the county-level.====We use a set of robustness checks, focused on subsamples, to examine potential threats to identification. First, we use a shorter time period, 1984 to 1994, to look only at employment impacts of the 1990 NSO listing before the 1994 Northwest Forest Plan. Impacts on employment are not statistically significantly different from the full-sample results for 1990–2000. Second, we explore the extent of leakage or spillovers between treatment and control groups. We use different regions in the U.S. to test the robustness of our estimates. Using counties only in the East Cost region of the U.S. as a control group, we find impacts on employment are not statistically significantly different from the full-sample. Finally, we run a series of placebo permutations, replacing our treatment group with randomly selected control groups, to see if we find similar estimates of policy impacts in placebo counties, where we should not. The resulting distributions of placebo-treatment effects are centered around zero, indicating support for our policy specification.====We explore more types of economic impacts, including impacts on timber markets and prices. As expected, we find a significant decline in timber sales in CA, OR, and WA. Similar to previous work (Rucker et al., 2005), we also find suggestive evidence of an increase in future prices for lumber. We examine the possibility of heterogeneous employment effects, looking at treatment groups separately by each of the NSO states: CA, OR, and WA, rather than one treatment group for all three. Results indicate timber employment declines in CA were smaller than in OR and WA, and recovery began earlier, by 1996. We also examine heterogeneity in impacts by the amount of public forest in counties, and find that counties with higher shares of public forest experience a larger negative timber employment impact. We test, at the industry level, for positive employment impacts, by repeating the DD analysis for other industries that may have grown due to the 1990 NSO listing. None of the six industries we analyze show a significant growth in employment due to the NSO listing. Finally, we look at possible effects on regional migration and find a small, but precise, decline in the region’s working-age population.====In what follows, we summarize the sequence of events leading to the 1990 listing and critical habitat designation for the NSO, how we use the abrupt shock of limits placed on timber harvesting to estimate the impact on Lumber and Wood Products sector employment levels in the region, and present the results on employment, timber sales and harvests, and lumber prices.",Labor market impacts of land protection: The Northern Spotted Owl,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069621000589,1 June 2021,2021,Research Article,149.0

Under these mechanisms, the probability of an audit depends on relative comparisons among peers, with agencies directing resources towards those entities the agencies believe to be less compliant than other similar regulated entities. Despite their theoretical advantages, no previous empirical study explores whether any agency implements these mechanisms. We provide this evidence by examining the inspection strategies of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regional offices and state agencies charged with enforcing Clean Water Act discharge limits imposed on chemical manufacturing facilities. We find that federal inspectors appear to use competitive endogenous audit mechanisms involving relative evaluation but state inspectors apparently do not. Our empirical study represents the first necessary step for demonstrating that use of competitive endogenous audit mechanisms improves compliance in practice.","Competitive endogenous audit mechanisms are one way for budget-constrained regulatory agencies to improve compliance with regulatory laws. Rather than randomly auditing regulated entities (Becker, 1968), under an endogenous audit mechanism, the regulatory agency selects the probability of an audit depending on the characteristics of the regulated entity. In particular, under a competitive endogenous audit mechanism, the probability of an audit depends on relative comparisons among peers, with the agency directing resources towards those entities the agency believes to be less compliant than other similar regulated entities. These relative comparisons create competition among regulated entities to avoid an audit. In turn, this competition improves compliance compared with an equivalent random audit mechanism.==== Several theoretical studies (Gilpatric et al., 2011, 2015; Oestreich, 2015) and experimental studies (Gilpatric et al., 2011, 2015; Cason et al., 2016) establish the benefits of competitive endogenous audit mechanisms over random audit mechanisms. We provide the first empirical evidence that enforcement agencies appear to employ a competitive endogenous audit mechanism in practice.====To provide this evidence, we select the particular regulatory realm of environmental protection. Since the mechanism involves peer comparisons, an agency most likely focuses on compliance with a single law. We choose the U.S. Clean Water Act (CWA) for our empirical application. While an agency may consider all facilities regulated under the CWA, we focus on a single sector – chemical manufacturing – in order to tighten our construction of the peer group. This particular sector is policy relevant since it represents one of the top wastewater discharging sectors in the US. (See Section 2).==== For this empirical analysis, we investigate the inspection strategies of both Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regional offices and state environmental agencies since both play important roles regarding the enforcement of the CWA. We jointly estimate the likelihood of an EPA regional office conducting an inspection and the likelihood of a state agency conducting an inspection at a particular CWA-regulated facility in a given month. We estimate these two outcomes as functions of the facility's own recent compliance history and the recent compliance history of other CWA-regulated facilities operating in the same sector and state, representing our primary peer group, and using the group average compliance history as the primary basis of relative comparison.====We find evidence that federal inspectors appear to use a competitive endogenous audit mechanism involving relative evaluation (which we label as “relative targeting”) but state inspectors apparently do not. Specifically, federal wastewater inspectors are ==== likely to inspect a given facility when other similar facilities are less compliant, consistent with implementation of a competitive audit mechanism involving relative evaluation. In contrast, state wastewater inspectors are ==== likely to inspect a given facility when other similar facilities are less compliant. As one interpretation of this latter result, state agencies may use the weaker extent of compliance on the part of other similar facilities as a rationale for inspecting a particular facility in the same sector.==== To explore the causal link from peer group comparison to inspection decisions, we construct and examine alternative peer groups and alternative bases of relative comparison. As one example of the former, we construct two peer groups that distinguish between the state in which an individual facility operates and other states in the same EPA region; as one example of the latter, we construct the maximum compliance history within a peer group.====In addition to providing evidence of a competitive endogenous audit mechanism in the form of relative targeting, we also investigate what we label as “absolute targeting”. Under this alternative form of targeting, a facility's own compliance history affects agencies' inspection or enforcement strategies. Harrington (1988) demonstrates theoretically how targeting enforcement on a facility's past compliance can leverage limited enforcement resources and increase the average compliance rate, given fixed budgetary resources.==== Laboratory experiments find only mixed support for the benefits of absolute targeting (Clark et al., 2004; Cason and Gangadharan, 2006). Empirical studies of environmentally related regulatory inspections explore whether agencies implement absolute targeting in practice. These studies examine the role of a facility's own compliance history and also find mixed results. In particular, some studies find weak or no effects (Dion et al., 1998; Eckert and Eckert, 2010), while other studies find strong evidence of absolute targeting (Helland, 1998a; Stafford, 2002, 2003; Rousseau, 2007). Similar to the latter set of studies, we find that both federal and state inspectors target regulated facilities that are less compliant in an absolute sense. In other words, a facility's own recent compliance history positively affects the likelihood of both a federal inspection and a state inspection.====While a broad literature empirically explores regulatory inspections, we contribute most strongly to the empirical literature on environmentally related inspections (e.g., Deily and Gray, 1991; Dion et al., 1998; Earnhart, 2004a,c; Gray and Shadbegian, 2004; Earnhart, 2015). These studies of inspections examine various factors influencing inspection decisions, such as a facility's compliance history (as noted above), firm and facility characteristics (e.g., size), regulatory budgets, and local community characteristics (e.g., employment). Our study contributes to this literature in two ways. First and foremost, we test for implementation of relative targeting. All previous studies of targeting examine only absolute targeting. As part of this contribution, we examine different constructions of the peer group and the basis of relative comparison. Our study makes a second contribution by comparing the roles of targeting – both absolute and relative – between state and federal inspection decisions. Specifically, we compare the effect of a facility's own compliance history on state decisions and the effect of the same factor on federal decisions; we run the same comparison for the effects of other facilities' compliance history on state and federal decisions. As a third contribution, we assess the effects of preceding inspections and enforcement actions on current inspection decisions and then compare these effects between federal and state agencies; this assessment and comparison offer additional insight on agencies' targeting strategies. Lastly, our empirical study represents the first necessary step for demonstrating that use of competitive endogenous audit mechanisms improves compliance in practice.====While the EPA provides considerable guidance to inspectors on how to choose facilities for inspection (discussed in Section 2.2), we provide evidence on the factors that drive inspectors’ decisions in practice. We conclude that EPA regional offices employ the inspection strategy of relative targeting. Yet EPA guidelines do not instruct inspectors to implement this strategy. In contrast, state agencies employ a distinctively different inspection strategy that is inconsistent with random inspections, absolute targeting, or relative targeting. Our results suggest that state agencies employ a form of anticipatory targeting. Under this strategy, the state agency interprets an increase in the average discharge ratio in a given sector as reflecting a “bad trend”, leading the agency to inspect an individual facility in the same sector in order to secure evidence for a possible future enforcement case; in this light, the state agency seeks to punish a likely future violation.====The rest of the study unfolds as follows. Section 2 describes the background including related literature and the regulatory context. Section 3 offers a simple conceptual framework based on the relative evaluation model of Gilpatric et al. (2011). Section 4 describes our data sources. Section 5 constructs an econometric framework based on the conceptual framework. Section 6 addresses econometric issues and explains our econometric methods. Section 7 reports and interprets our primary econometric results. Section 8 reports additional results that support the robustness of our findings.

One component of biodiversity is the geographic distribution of where species live, with species that live in only one habitat being endemic to that particular habitat. This study investigates how respondents to a discrete choice experiment ascribe value to the conservation of five different fish species with one species being non-endemic to the study area and familiar to most respondents while another, much lesser-known species, is endemic to the study area. We use a ==== to investigate possible distance decay effects in which species respondents prioritize for economic valuation. Results suggest individuals who live relatively close to unfamiliar species may be among those who are more likely to value such species higher relative to more familiar substitute species.","Species with biodiversity importance, often candidates for non-market valuation, are important not just for their scarcity, but for their role in ecosystem functioning at both local and global scales (MESAB, 2005). Since the Convention on Biological Diversity in 1993, the public profile of biodiversity and species in sensitive habitats have risen to prominence as a policy issue (Novacek, 2008). Stated preference methods are often employed to capture the non-market values the general public ascribes to species of biological importance. Despite the public’s general interest in biodiversity conservation, some scientists contend that the public’s occasionally limited prior scientific knowledge makes the use of stated preferences methods problematic for policy guidance (e.g. Sagoff, 1988).====One illustration of the dilemma posed by the public’s interest in conservation but often limited scientific knowledge of ecosystems and biodiversity is the use of familiar ‘flagship’ species as easily recognizable symbols to “increase public awareness of conservation issues and rally support for the protection of [specific] species” (Favreau et al., 2006 p 3,951). The most commonly chosen flagship species are mammals with large body sizes such as iconic predators or primates, as well as large birds (Ward et al., 1999, Dietz et al., 1994, White et al., 2001, Anderson et al., 2007). Perhaps most famously, the giant panda is the symbol of the World Wildlife Foundation and is arguably one of the most recognizable symbols of conservation in the world (Williams, 2006). However, some seemingly unlikely species have also been chosen as flagship species for various purposes, such as cold-blooded vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants (Walpole and Leader-williams, 2002, Samways, 1994, Farjon et al., 2004). Despite their potential to inform the public and gather conservation support, important yet esoteric species are not frequently selected for use as flagship species (see review in Caro and Girling, 2010). For example, SAVE Brazil selected the Orange-bellied Antwren as a flagship species due to its endangered status, restricted distribution and the similarity between its Portuguese common name and the Portuguese word for conserving. Despite indications the educational program was successful, the Antwren was subsequently replaced as the flagship species due to concerns that it was still poorly known to the target audience even after several years (Veríssimo et al., 2013b).====How the public ascribes economic value to species with important scientific characteristics but are previously unknown to them given the presence of familiar substitute species is important since much of the world’s important biodiversity is often unknown to the public (MESAB, 2005). Many stated preferences studies investigate species that have iconic, cultural, or charismatic appeal Favreau et al., 2006, Martín-López et al., 2008, Wallmo and Lew, 2016; however, non-charismatic but still widely recognized species have occasionally been successful as flagship species for education and awareness purposes (Caro and Girling, 2010). Particularly for marine threatened species, Lew (2015) reviews the stated preferences literature to find “the majority of species valued can be classified as charismatic megafauna – seals and sea lions, whales and sea turtles – in addition to well-known species, like salmon” (p 13). Given the criticism that flagship species selection should diversify to include more species than the traditionally charismatic (e.g. Bennett et al., 2015), more exploration of non-charismatic potential flagship species is needed. Therefore, non-charismatic species, including but not limited to those that are simply familiar to many individuals, are important to consider as potential flagship species as well.====In addition to considering unfamiliar species for conservation marketing, some in the conservation community have suggested using multiple flagship species akin to a market segmentation approach, but investigations into possible spatial dimensions of such market segmentation are currently lacking (e.g. Wright et al., 2015, Root-Bernstein and Armesto, 2013). A potential spatial strategy for segmented conservation marketing could be to use previously unknown species with important biodiversity characteristics as flagship species in areas near their habitats. In the economic valuation literature, sometimes the value of certain environmental goods and services is higher relatively close to where those goods and services are located; an effect called distance decay.====Distance effects for conservation of carnivores or species that have negative impacts on people living in close proximity to them can be expected to differ from non-predatory or otherwise non-nuisance species (e.g. Johansson et al., 2012). For valuation of generally benign species conservation, the subject of this investigation, studies frequently find little or no decrease in WTP with increasing distance between the species habitat and where respondents live (Pate and Loomis, 1997, Rudd, 2009, Wallmo and Lew, 2016, Glenk et al., 2019). It is even common for respondents to state significantly positive willingness-to-pay for conservation of both familiar and previously unfamiliar endemic species if they live on different continents than the species being valued (e.g. Horton et al., 2003, Morse-jones et al., 2012). Although some between country studies of differences in WTP indicate foreign respondents to state higher WTP for conservation compared to domestic respondents, others find the opposite result (e.g. Ressurreição et al., 2011, Richardson and Loomis, 2008, Botzen and Beukering, 2018). Such distance effects across countries can be confounded by differences in sociodemographic factors between countries with differing levels of industrialization and biodiversity.====To the authors’ knowledge, no study has specifically investigated if the frequent lack of distance decay in stated preferences valuation of species conservation also applies to relative values for unfamiliar species with important biodiversity characteristics compared to species of greater familiarity. The main purpose of this study is therefore to investigate if the absence of distance decay, a common finding about little-known species with important biodiversity characteristics from the stated preferences literature, also applies to ==== preferences for previously unknown endemic species. We use data from a stated preferences study conducted in The Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland aimed at eliciting people’s preferences for the existence of five different fish species in the Lough Melvin catchment. Because the options presented to respondents in the study described the conservation status of each fish species as either ‘conserved’ or ‘extinct’ after implementation of each respective choice, resulting values can be interpreted as the value of each species’ existence in the Lough Melvin catchment.====Following suggestions that different species may have appeal as flagship species to different subgroups of the public (e.g. Veríssimo et al., 2013a, Bennett et al., 2015), we use a latent class model to identify distinct subgroups of respondent preferences and focus our analysis on the relative preferences of each latent class (i.e. which species each latent class values higher than all other species). Our main focus in latent class identification is exploring how the Euclidean distance, in kilometers, between Lough Melvin and the location of each respondent’s primary residence relates to their relative valuation of two potential flagship species.====Of the two species that emerge as the relatively most preferred among respondents with high willingness-to-pay (WTP) for conservation, one of the species is the Atlantic salmon, familiar to most respondents but existing in catchments across Ireland, while another species, the Sonaghan, is known to few respondents but is endemic to Lough Melvin. We calculate unconditional and conditional (i.e. individual-specific) marginal rates of substitution between these two species and use this measure to explore potential distance decay in relative preferences. Possible decay effects in the marginal rate of substitution between likely choices for flagship species implies a geographic dimension in the relative non-use value of esoteric biodiversity. This approach may be relevant for conservation marketing by implying a geographic dimension in how to target different members of the public using different flagship species.====Our results provide novel insight on the distance decay effect of unfamiliar yet endemic species, which are often overlooked in favor of more familiar or popular species. Specifically, this study suggests that individuals who live relatively close to unfamiliar species may be among those who are more likely to value such species higher relative to more familiar species. In this study, we consider a familiar species to be a species with a name that stated preferences survey respondents recognize prior to taking the survey, not requiring any further specific knowledge.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: a brief background of the issue of familiarity and valuation is discussed before a pre the study area is presented to explain the context of the species being valued and their habitat. A methods section presents the data used for analysis as well as the econometric model and specification used.

Construction on water mains might disturb the service lines and increase lead levels in drinking water. We estimate the effects of water main maintenance on drinking water and children's blood levels by exploiting unique geocoded data and over 2,200 water main replacements in Chicago, a city with almost 400,000 known lead service lines. By comparing water and blood samples in homes at different distances from replaced mains before and after replacement, we find no evidence that water main replacement affects water or children's lead levels.","The provision of safe drinking water is deemed responsible for tremendous improvements in public health in the twentieth century (Alsan and Goldin, 2019). In modern cities, water utilities treat source water at treatment plants and distribute it through water mains that run under streets. Service lines connect each home to these mains. Any pathogens or pollutants that enter the system after the water leaves the treatment plant might constitute a threat to human health.====An estimated 6.5 to 10 millions lead service lines (LSLs) connect street water mains to homes in the United States (Environmental Protection Agency, 2016), and approximately a third of U.S. water systems report at least some LSLs (Cornwell et al., 2016). These lines might expose children to lead in drinking water unless natural sediments or added compounds in the water coat the pipes’ interior to prevent lead from leaching (Brown et al., 2011; Environmental Protection Agency, 2006; Triantafyllidou and Edwards, 2012). The deleterious effects of LSLs were highlighted by recent events in Flint, MI, where the switch to a more corrosive water source diminished the protective coating within LSLs, leading to heightened lead exposure (Edwards et al., 2015). Construction for water main upgrades, which requires cutting the service line, might mechanically or hydraulically disturb the mineral coating within LSLs in a manner similar to deprecated partial LSL replacements (Batterman et al., 2019; Del Toral, Porter and Schock, 2013; Quatrevaux, 2017).====Whether LSL disturbances during main construction harm public health matters because delays or increased costs could hinder infrastructure upgrades. Water utilities in the United States lose 14–18% of their treated water due to leaks (CNT, 2016; ASCE, 2017). Thus, U.S. cities face a potential trade-off between upgrading water infrastructure and exacerbating lead exposure. For example, the New Orleans inspector general recommends that the water utility inform residents of LSL disturbance risks and fully replaces LSLs whenever there are disturbances (Quatrevaux, 2017), while Washington, D.C., requires the city to pay for LSL replacement whenever the city replaces a water main (“Lead Water Service Line Replacement and Disclosure Amendment Act of 2018,” 2018). Concerns about LSL disruption from municipal construction projects prompted a prominent lawsuit against the City of Chicago. The plaintiffs allege that ====Lead exposure is associated with reduced IQ (Ferrie et al., 2015), lower educational attainment (Aizer et al., 2018; Grönqvist et al., 2017; Reyes, 2015b), and an increased risk of criminal activity (Aizer and Currie, 2019; Feigenbaum and Muller, 2016; Reyes, 2007, 2015a). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 535,000 children born in the United States in the 2000s had blood lead levels (BLLs) at or above 5 μg/dL (Wheeler and Brown, 2013). A quarter of Chicago zip codes have at least 5% of lead-tested children with BLLs at or above 5 μg/dL, and lead exposure correlates with socioeconomic disadvantage (Sampson and Winter 2016). Historically, the use of lead service lines has been associated with worse health and education outcomes in the presence of corrosive water (Troesken and Beeson, 2003; Clay et al., 2014; Ferrie et al., 2015; Feigenbaum and Muller, 2016). Since the deleading of gasoline, lead paint hazards in homes appear to be the most important source of lead exposure (Zartarian et al., 2017). However, Appendix Fig. A.1 shows a correlation of 0.45 between blood and water lead levels in Chicago zip codes, suggesting that lead in drinking water could explain some of the clusters of elevated BLLs in the city. The variation we exploit in this paper allows us to study the effects of water main construction in the presence of LSLs on drinking water quality and children's health, and not the effects of LSLs ====.====Use of lead service lines was standard practice in the United States through the 1920s because lead's malleability and flexibility make it easy to work with and resistant to decay and frost (Triantafyllidou and Edwards, 2012). As medical doctors and public health officials begun understanding the health hazards of lead poisoning, lobbying by the lead industry ensured continued use of lead pipes in certain cities (Rabin, 2008). The City of Chicago mandated use of LSLs until the Safe Drinking Water Act amendment of 1986 prohibited lead in service lines or premise plumbing (Environmental Protection Agency, 2006). Despite this ban, many legacy pipes remain in place across the United States. A recent inventory assessed that 389,893 of the 519,584 retail connections in Chicago are made of lead, 11,232 are lead-free, and the remainder are of unknown materials, possibly including lead.====In response to the Flint scandal, cities are now conducting inventories and planning replacement of LSLs in line with the EPA's recommendations (Environmental Defense Fund, 2018; Neltner, 2018). With estimated costs for LSL replacements ranging from $2,500 to over $8,000 per line, the cost of replacing all LSLs nationwide ranges from $16 to $80 billion (Environmental Protection Agency, 2016).==== With competing demands for limiting lead exposure and limiting water loss, it is crucial to understand whether upgrading water mains will exacerbate childhood lead exposure from LSLs. Data from Evanston, Illinois, suggest that costs of water main replacements could increase by 0.8–5.4% if all LSLs connected to a water main had to be replaced during main construction, although actual costs depend on LSL density.==== Evanston has 79% lead service lines, compared to between 75% and 98% for Chicago.====We exploit a large-scale main replacement program in Chicago and a unique combination of data sources to causally estimate the effects of pipe maintenance on drinking water quality and children's blood levels. Specifically, we spatially link data on over 2,200 main replacements completed across Chicago from 2011 through the end of 2017 to over 4,000 sets of water samples between 2016 and 2017 and over 600,000 blood lead tests performed on over 320,000 children living in Chicago between 2010 and 2016. We compare BLLs of children in the same neighborhood, for example a zip code or block group, who live near water mains slated for replacement and whose BLL tests happen either before or after the construction. Our identification strategy relies on the exogeneity of water sampling and children's BLL test data, where the latter are based on their physician visit, and main replacement in their neighborhood. We find no evidence of changes in testing around main construction.====Our empirical analysis finds no evidence that main construction affects children's health by increasing the lead content of drinking water or BLLs. Our preferred estimates, which control for block group fixed effects, rule out effects of 0.09 μg/dL, or 5% over the average BLL in our sample (1.85 μg/dL) and all but one of our 22 robustness checks rule out effects larger than 10%. Moreover, we find no evidence that construction disproportionately affects certain subpopulations particularly burdened by lead exposure. Finally, we find no evidence of heterogeneous effects after the Flint scandal made the issue of lead in drinking water more salient.====A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that the costs of requiring LSL replacement during main replacement exceed the potential health benefits in terms of preventing BLLs of 5 μg/dL or above due to LSL disturbances caused by the main replacement. However, we cannot reject that providing faucet filters during construction could be cost-effective. Importantly, while we find no evidence that LSL disturbances during water main construction affect BLLs, we do not speak to whether LSLs in general are associated with lead levels that warrant intervention.====To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to estimate the causal impact of LSL disturbances from water main construction on drinking water quality and children's health in a large sample. Two studies in Chicago examine the effects of physical LSL disturbances on lead in drinking water. First, Batterman et al. (2019) find similar lead levels in tap water samples in 273 voluntarily enrolled homes connected to repaired water mains before and after construction, although the authors identify potential transient peaks in a subset of homes. Our drinking water results confirm these patterns in a larger sample, and our BLL results allow us to investigate heterogeneity and mechanisms in a much larger and less selected sample. Second, Del Toral et al. (2013) find higher water lead levels in 13 homes where LSLs had been physically disturbed in the previous six years, relative to 21 homes without known disturbances.==== These findings were widely cited in newspaper articles,==== and they are a major piece of evidence cited by the majority in the appellate court decision to allow a class action lawsuit against the City of Chicago to move forward (“Berry v. the City of Chicago,” 2019). Our large data set including both drinking water quality and health outcomes allows us to obtain more robust results on the effects of water main construction on lead poisoning than this smaller, cross-sectional study.====Our findings complement the growing literature on the effects of water chemistry changes on health outcomes. In Flint, Hanna-Attisha et al. (2015) estimate that the percent of children with BLLs at 5 μg/dL or above doubled from 2.4% before the switch to 4.9% after the switch. The water crisis was also associated with lower fertility rates and poorer birth outcomes (Danagoulian and Jenkins, 2018; Grossman and Slusky, 2019; Wang et al., 2018), despite evidence of households’ avoidance behavior, such as using bottled water (Christensen et al., 2018). Dave and Yang (2020) exploit a switch in water treatment in one of the treatment plants in Newark, New Jersey, to show that exposure to drinking water contaminated by lead in utero is associated with worse birth outcomes. Our findings help us put into perspective these case studies that highlight important breaking points in water system management: our analysis shows that LSL disturbances caused by water main replacements did not pose a health threat in Chicago, Illinois, potentially due to differences in water chemistry and water treatment.",Infrastructure upgrades and lead exposure: Do cities face trade-offs when replacing water mains?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069621000541,21 May 2021,2021,Research Article,152.0

That is, we show that stable coalitions are either small or if they are large, the potential gains from cooperation are small. First, we argue that the extension to a mitigation-adaptation game is a generalization of Barrett's pure mitigation game. Second, we consider for this extension not only the Nash-Cournot scenario, as in Bayramoglu et al. (2018), but also the Stackelberg scenario. Third, we show generally that if mitigation levels in different countries are strategic substitutes, stable coalitions are larger in the Stackelberg than in the Nash-Cournot scenario.

Fifth, for all possible combination of assumptions, we demonstrate that the paradox of cooperation is robust, except if mitigation and adaptation were strategic complements, which we argue is an assumption not supported by empirical evidence.","Mitigation and adaptation are two strategies to combat climate change. Mitigation directly targets at solving the cause of the problem, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, causing global warming. In contrast, adaptation aims at ameliorating the negative consequence of global warming. Whereas mitigation is typically viewed as a pure public good, adaptation is seen as a private good (reducing only damages of the party conducting adaptation). Addressing global warming requires international cooperation: isolated actions will not make a big difference if other countries do not follow suit. However, the signature and ratification of effective international climate agreements have proved to be difficult in the past. There is a widespread consensus that the Kyoto Protocol has not been able to curb the increase of greenhouse gases in the past, and also most scholars have doubts about the effectiveness of the Paris Accord signed in 2015, as highlighted by the latest IPCC 1.5° report (IPCC et al., 2018). As the effects of global warming become more and more visible, adaptation becomes increasingly important as a policy option. This is not only evident by the increasing literature on the costs and effectiveness of adaptation as well as about the practical and technical obstacles of implementation, in particular, in developing countries (IEG 2013 and World Bank 2010), but adaptation is also an integral part of almost all recent climate change negotiations (UNFCCC 2014 and 2016). The main obstacle of addressing the cause of global warming is the public good nature of mitigation. Reducing emissions comes at a cost that is borne by individual countries, but the benefits are enjoyed by all countries worldwide.====International climate negotiation failures have been largely explained by game-theoretic models of international environmental agreements (IEAs).==== In the standard workhorse model with only mitigation and symmetric players, only small agreements are stable if signatories and non-signatories choose their mitigation levels simultaneously, which has been called the Nash-Cournot scenario.==== For Stackelberg leadership of signatories, more optimistic results have been obtained in terms of the size of stable agreements (Barrett 1994; Diamantoudi and Sartzetakis 2006; Rubio and Ulph 2006). However, as Barrett (1994) coined it, the paradox of cooperation persists: stable coalitions are either small or if they are large, the potential gains from cooperation are small. Recently, Bayramoglu et al. (2018) argued for the Nash-Cournot scenario that more optimistic results may be obtained if countries have a second strategy at their avail, namely adaptation, which they coined the mitigation-adaptation game. They show that if the ==== is sufficiently large, reaction functions in mitigation space may become upward sloping, associated with large stable agreements, including the grand coalition. This result does ==== depend on whether mitigation and adaptation are assumed to be substitutes (as commonly believed) or complements (as an unlikely possibility), but only that the rate of substitution or complementarity is large in absolute terms. However, Bayramoglu et al. (2018) neither measure the effectiveness of stable agreements nor do they consider Stackelberg leadership as an alternative assumption.====We acknowledge in this paper that the mitigation-adaptation game is a generalization of Barrett's pure mitigation game for which we want to find out whether the paradox of cooperation is still a robust conclusion. We consider for this generalization not only the Nash-Cournot scenario, as in Bayramoglu et al. (2018), but also the Stackelberg scenario, as proposed by Eisenack and Kähler (2016) and Marrouch and Chaudhuri (2011). We show generally (neither resorting to specific payoff functions nor simulations) that if mitigation levels in different countries are strategic substitutes, stable coalitions are larger in the Stackelberg than in the Nash-Cournot scenario. This is reversed if mitigation levels are strategic complements, which is possible if the strategic interaction between mitigation and adaptation is sufficiently strong. For all possible combination of assumptions, we demonstrate that the paradox of cooperation is robust, except if mitigation and adaptation were strategic complements, which we argue is an assumption that lacks empirical support.====In what follows, we lay out the model in section 2, derive our general analytical results in section 3 and those for a specific payoff function in section 4.

However, members of the public can play an important role in monitoring for compliance, which we analyze with a novel dataset of Colorado regulatory activities. We find regulators frequently conduct follow-up inspections of people’s complaints, and these complaint-driven inspections are at least as likely to be followed by regulatory action as “normal” scheduled inspections. However, regulators do not increase inspection activity of other assets owned by a firm that was complained about, consistent with regulators treating these complaints as “one-offs”. An inspector conducting a complaint inspection crowds out two regular inspections at the daily level, but we find no evidence of crowd-out at time scales of one month or greater. Finally, heterogeneity across complaint types suggests people are more adept at identifying nuisance-related violations (e.g. noise, smell), but are less adept at identifying more technical violations.","What role do members of the public play in enforcement of environmental regulations? In many contexts, people can monitor potential violators of environmental regulations and call upon public enforcement agencies. These public agencies generally have discretion in whether and how to respond to these private complaints. This combination of private monitoring coupled with discretionary public enforcement is common for many environmental regulatory settings, such as illegal dumping of hazardous materials, air and water violations by oil and gas operations, noise and other nuisances.====This paper focuses specifically on how a regulatory agency responds to complaints: Do complaints lead to additional inspections with greater assessed penalties? Does following up on complaints crowd out regular inspection activity? Do regulators update their beliefs about a firm’s compliance after receiving complaints? Does the regulator find violations more often when responding to complaints than when conducting regular inspections? Here, we leverage a rich dataset of all formal complaints, inspections, and penalties by Colorado’s oil and gas regulatory agency, the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, from 2012 to 2018 totaling 879 complaints and over 100,000 inspections. This is an ideal setting to examine questions of private monitoring and public enforcement as we observe many different firms with similar production technologies, that operate across different regulatory jurisdictions, but are all regulated by the same state agency.====Our analysis suggests that complainants can have a real but limited role to play in environmental regulation. On the one hand, people are home (and therefore near wells) far more frequently than inspectors are on site, and complainants do seem to be able to effectively identify some classes of violations. Furthermore, fears that complaints crowd out the agency’s ability to perform other inspections seem unfounded, though there may be adjustment on unobserved margins such as overtime budgets or inspection intensity. On the other hand, complaints do not seem to identify otherwise unknown (to the regulator) “bad actor” firms or sites, nor do they uncover more technical violations. Specifically, we find that (1) conditional on firm and geographic fixed effects, an inspection following up on a complaint is neither more nor less likely to lead to penalties than a regular inspection, (2) each complaint inspection crowds out two regular inspections at a daily level, but does not crowd out or crowd in regular inspections at longer time scales, (3) complaints are typically about nuisance-related potential violations such as odors and noise, and (4) complaint inspections are more likely to lead to penalties when the complaints are about odors, but not noise.====This work speaks to a larger literature on monitoring and enforcement and determinants of regulatory behavior (Gray and Shimshack, 2011). Focusing on the role of private actors, there is evidence that regulators respond rationally to complaints (Earnhart, 2000), that complaints can lead to long-term governmental performance improvements (Botero et al., 2013), that complaints are correlated with firm practices (Scott, 2018), and that complaints can improve or harm environmental quality depending on key parameter values (Goeschl and Jürgens, 2012). This literature studies low (Botero et al., 2013) and high-income countries (Earnhart, 2000, Scott, 2018, Evans and Shimshack, 2019). Broadly, complaints are an important example of a regulatory setting combining private monitoring with public enforcement.==== Other important instances of this combination include lawsuits (Langpap, 2007, Langpap and Shimshack, 2010, Ashenmiller and Norman, 2011) and voting (Kahn, 2007, Kroll et al., 2007).

We model voluntary participation of states in unanimously approved federal ====. A Pareto-improving federal emission price coexists with state-level emission pricing. Federal revenues are distributed equally per capita (egalitarian), in proportion to states' historical emission levels (sovereignty), or states’ actual payments (juste retour). We find that the existence of Pareto-improving uniform federal prices depends on ==== differences, transfer rules, and on whether or not states anticipate transfers. Sovereignty transfers work in all cases. Differences in ==== can undermine egalitarian transfers. Juste retour transfers render federal policy ineffective if states anticipate them. The richest state prefers the lowest Pareto-optimal federal price (“minimum price”) as it becomes the largest net-donor. Adding different population sizes, the richest and largest (smallest) state prefers the minimum price with sovereignty and juste retour transfers (egalitarian transfers). Therefore, rich states brake and simultaneously make possible passing unanimous federal policy.","Environmental pollution, pandemics, and climate change are prime examples of threats to the international community. Much scholarship in economics suggests that rich people and countries voluntarily contribute more to mitigating such threats than their poor counterparts (Olson and Zeckhauser, 1966; Bergstrom et al., 1986). From the optimality conditions of welfare maximization, it also follows that rich entities should contribute more than poor ones. When using a uniform multinational price signal, for instance, allocative efficiency alone demands higher transfers from rich to poor entities (e.g. Sheeran, 2006; Chichilnisky and Heal, 1994; Sandmo, 2007; Engström and Gars, 2015).==== But the necessary multinational transfers from the rich may exceed their voluntary contributions (e.g. Stavins, 1997; Shiell, 2003; Sandmo, 2007) and coexisting local policies can jeopardize the efficiency of the multinational policy (cf. Williams, 2012; Burtraw et al., 2018).====In practice, federations have a multinational (federal) government and a multi-layered environmental policy of federal and state authorities. If a federal policy represents a Pareto-improvement for its members, it can find broad acceptance among the states. The European Union (EU) is a case in point. Broad state support is crucial for EU legislation since EU policies often require unanimity to get passed. This creates difficulties because states are heterogeneous. For instance, states can differ in size and wealth. A pertinent question becomes: How does the heterogeneity of member states affect their willingness to federalize part of their environmental policies?====In this article, we investigate how federalism can help collective voluntary emission reduction of heterogeneous member states. We study the role of a federal authority that uses transfers and a uniform federal emission price to coordinate the states’ emission mitigation efforts. It strives simultaneously to reduce emissions for the entire federation and to ensure voluntary participation of the states. States differ in wealth and population size and set local policies that coexist with federal policy. Improving the understanding of the obstacles and requirements for the voluntary participation of states in federal environmental policy helps with i) assessing the impact of the coexisting policies at the state and federal levels and ii) guiding burden-sharing design in federal systems, which then, in turn, allows for the identification of iii) a basis for broad consensus towards federal policy design.====Our main contribution is to show under which conditions unanimity ensuring, uniform federal emission prices exist. Specifically, we find that the richest state takes on the role of the largest donor, and its utility is maximized at the lowest of all optimal federal prices that ensure voluntary participation. This price designates the unanimity ensuring federal minimum price.====Surprisingly, the conditions for voluntary participation of states in federal environmental policy have not yet been investigated. Contributions on the voluntary provision of public goods, multinational environmental policy, and fiscal federalism, however, have already analyzed individual aspects of the above research question and serve as the point of departure for the present study. The Cold War and the founding of NATO initially stimulated the research on voluntary, decentralized public good provision. This strand of literature finds that rich entities voluntarily bear a larger share of the burden of global public good provision (Olson, 1965; Olson and Zeckhauser, 1966; Bergstrom et al., 1986). Second, spurred by the necessity for mitigating climate change and the design of the Kyoto Protocol, literature emerged on centralized multinational environmental policy, finding that rich entities should bear the larger share of the burden even for reasons of allocative efficiency alone (e.g. Chichilnisky and Heal, 1994). Third, the literature on fiscal federalism considers the decentralized and centralized institutional perspectives at the same time. Böhringer et al. (2016) study tax base rivalry between states and the federal government in the context of carbon pricing. They find that a state can implement local carbon pricing largely at the expense of other states. If state and federal policies coexist, Williams (2012) finds that a federal emission tax can be superior to emission quantity controls since the additivity of the taxes prevents a mutual overruling of state and federal environmental policies. Since the second-generation theory of fiscal federalism is concerned with the viability and limited power of federal institutions (Oates, 2005), the present study contributes to this research strand in particular. We provide a detailed literature review in Section 2.====We develop a general equilibrium model with coexisting state-level and federal emission pricing. All governments use emission pricing to reduce the damage caused by transboundary emissions. Emissions are an essential input for private good production.==== The analytical part of our study focuses on state differences in terms of different capital endowments, and we often keep population size equal across states. The numerical part more thoroughly investigates population size differences. Each state government non-cooperatively chooses a domestic emission price to maximize domestic welfare and distributes revenue from the policy equally among its consumers. Since both state- and federal-level emission policies coexist, the policy at one level affects the revenues at the other. This is known as a vertical fiscal externality (cf. Dahlby and Wilson, 2003). We explore both state behavior that internalizes the vertical fiscal externality and behavior that is ignorant of it. In the following, we refer to these cases as “anticipation” and “no anticipation”, respectively.==== The federal government cares for the welfare of the entire federation. It has a strategic advantage over state governments such that it can influence state policy choices through its own policy choice (Stackelberg leader) (cf. Wilson, 2006). Given a revenue transfer rule and using a uniform emission price, the federal government maximizes the welfare of one state while ensuring that no other state falls below its decentralized outcome (Pareto-improvement).==== We compare three federal transfer rules: 1) equal per capita transfers (egalitarian), 2) transfers proportional to a states’ historical emission levels (sovereignty), and 3) transfers proportional to actual emission payments (juste retour). All of these rules are well-established in policy practice and theory (cf. Section 2).====We find that, under specific conditions, there exists a range of Pareto-improving, uniform federal emission prices. The conditions involve the transfer rule, the presence of federal transfer anticipation, as well as the differences in endowments across states. In the following, we denote by “feasible federal emission prices” those uniform federal emission prices that ensure Pareto-improvements (i.e., unanimity) in the federation and that cannot be Pareto-dominated. If feasible federal emission prices exist, we find that poor states benefit from federal emission pricing in terms of welfare by definition, but the more stringent the federal price, the more they benefit. Also by definition, rich states always gain in welfare in the range of feasible federal emission prices. The more stringent the federal price, however, the more they net-contribute to poor states. This observation is reflected in the ranking of the feasible federal emission prices: The lowest feasible price (federal minimum price) prioritizes the interests of the richest state, while the poorest state gains the most at the highest feasible price.====There are two possibilities to interpret the existence and ranking of feasible federal prices concerning federal policy negotiations. The first interpretation resembles what we consider the conservative and currently more realistic case for climate policy. Suppose that net-donors’ voluntary participation is a requirement for successful federal policy negotiations. Further, suppose that the negotiations start at a federal emission price of zero and incrementally bid until a state vetoes a further price increase. In that case, our results suggest that the richest state, in its position as the largest donor, would want to settle at the federal minimum price. In that sense, the richest state puts brakes on the negotiation process as it represents a bottleneck for further increases of the uniform emission price above the minimum price.==== At the same time, by virtue of its role as the largest donor, the richest state makes federal policy feasible in the first place. The second interpretation of how the feasible price range can relate to the negotiation process is in terms of the ultimate federal price that is acceptable to all states. Suppose negotiations do not end after the first veto, but at the agreeable ultimate price.==== Our results suggest that all states, including the richest, would accept an ultimate federal price of either zero or the maximum price.====Regarding the federal transfer rules, we find that the sovereignty rule is the only rule that always yields feasible federal prices regardless of the capital heterogeneities present. Juste retour transfers perform identically to sovereignty transfers if they are unanticipated by the states. Similar to d’Autumne et al. (2016) and Shiell (2003), whose models do not cover anticipation, we also find that juste retour transfers are effective when they are not anticipated. If the states, however, anticipate the federal juste retour transfers, this rule becomes ineffective, as it always reproduces the outcomes of the situation without federal policy. Finally, if capital heterogeneity is too pronounced, egalitarian transfers fail to produce any feasible federal emission prices. Our numerical analysis distinguishes rich and poor states (in terms of capital per capita) as well as large and small states (in terms of population size). Both rich (poor) states have the same capital per capita level. Likewise, both small (large) states have the same population level. Thus, the numerical analysis comprises four states with four different aggregate capital levels: rich and small, rich and large, poor and small, poor and large. If egalitarian transfers are used, we find that the minimum feasible federal emission price corresponds to the richest state with a smallest population size. If, on the other hand, sovereignty transfers or unanticipated juste retour transfers are used, this role is taken on by the richest state with the largest population size (being the richest in aggregate capital endowments).====Further research should also examine the heterogeneity of states in terms of production technologies. For example, Poland, as a relatively poor but large country, has many coal-fired power plants. On the other hand, Denmark is a relatively small country that is wealthy and has many wind-farms. Roolfs et al. (2020) have analyzed heterogeneity in production technologies using a numerical model calibrated to the EU. They find that technological heterogeneity can change the results in terms of the ranking of feasible federal prices towards emission intensive states.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the related literature and links the considered transfer rules to commonly used equity criteria. Section 3 presents and discusses the multilevel general equilibrium model. The impact of different transfer criteria is analyzed in Section 4, divided into an analytical and a numerical part.

Using high-frequency data on air pollution, car trips, and mass-transit systems ridership, I evaluate the effectiveness of temporary driving bans triggered by air quality warnings in Santiago, Chile. I employ a fuzzy ==== that uses the thresholds in the air quality index used to announce these warnings as instruments for their announcement. Results show that these temporary bans reduce car trips by 6–9% during peak hours, and by 7–8% during off-peak hours. This is consistent with air pollution reductions during peak hours, and with increases in the use of Santiago's mass-transit systems during hours the systems run with excess capacity. Increments in mass-transit ridership uncover the importance of alternative modes of transportation in securing the effectiveness of temporary driving bans.","This paper evaluates a command-and-control policy aimed at reducing mobile source pollution in Santiago during days of critical air pollution. Heavy air pollution severely affects health (Chay and Greenstone, 2003; Neidell, 2004; Currie and Neidell, 2005; Knittel et al., 2016), educational outcomes (Currie et al., 2009; Stafford, 2015), labor supply (Ostro, 1983; Hausman et al., 1984; Hanna and Oliva, 2015), and productivity (Crocker and Horst, 1981; Zivin and Neidell, 2012; Lichter et al., 2017), particularly in developing countries (Greenstone and Hanna, 2014; Greenstone and Jack, 2015). In Latin America alone, air pollution puts at risk the health of more than 80 million inhabitants, generating annual losses of about 65 million working days (United Nations Environment Programme, 2002). Among countries in this region, Chile ranks second after Mexico in exposure to coarse particulate matter (PM====) in urban areas, and first in exposure to fine particulate matter (PM====), with Santiago ranked as one of the most polluted cities in the country (World Health Organization, 2014).====As in many metropolitan areas, poor air quality in Santiago is primarily due to mobile source pollution. Temporary driving restrictions aimed at curbing this pollution prohibit the driving in Santiago of a share of light-duty private vehicles based upon the last digits of their license plates. As a deviation from similar schemes in other countries, however, these bans affect both dirty and clean cars as part of a set of daily mitigation actions put into place during spikes in air pollution.==== These actions are part of 24-h preventive measures called “environmental episodes” (hereafter called “air quality warnings” or simply “episodes”), implemented in Santiago whenever the authorities foresee worrisome levels of the city's air quality index. Different index thresholds lead to a three-tier system of episodes (i.e., alerts, pre-emergencies, and emergencies), whose temporary driving bans further tighten the permanent driving restriction on dirty vehicles, as well as impose new restrictions on clean vehicles.==== Taking advantage of the discontinuities in the issuance of these events, I empirically evaluate the effectiveness of their short-term driving bans in curbing air pollution and traffic flows.====License plate-based driving restrictions constitute a common governmental strategy to reduce airborne pollution and traffic congestion in many cities of the world (e.g., Athens, Beijing, Berlin, Bogota, Mexico City, New Delhi, São Paulo).,==== Yet, mixed conclusions about their causal impact still cast doubt on their effectiveness as an instrument to improve local air quality. Evidence of drivers bypassing these bans by either shifting their driving towards hours or days unaffected by the policy or purchasing a second car to fully avoid these restrictions, are the main caveats to the effectiveness of this policy (Davis, 2008; Gallego et al., 2013; Bonilla, 2019; Zhang et al., 2017). Notwithstanding, most of the literature relies on evidence of mobile source pollution while little is known about the impact of these bans on vehicle flows and alternative modes of transportation.====Whether driving bans are effective, they would get cars off the roads and push their drivers towards cleaner and uncrowded transportation modes. An effective policy is, therefore, expected to produce a measurable impact not only on mobile source air pollution but on car use and mass-transit ridership as well. This paper sheds light on these effects by approximating the causal impact that temporary driving bans, triggered by air quality warnings, generate on hourly pollution, vehicle flows, and mass-transit systems ridership, as a substitute for driving. While other works already have used a cross-sectional version of similar datasets to evaluate Santiago's driving bans (e.g., de Grange and Troncoso (2011)), the present study adds to the previous literature by adopting a causal framework that informs on the effectiveness of these bans as a policy mechanism, instead of delivering averages for days with and without the policy. In this sense, and as far as the author's knowledge, this is the first paper that evaluates the impact of temporary driving bans on car trips and mass-transit ridership that prioritizes causality. As an additional feature, I study this policy over a longer time in addition to incorporating the whole set of temporary restrictions into the analysis.====Innovations in Santiago's policy also help to understand whether temporary driving restrictions reduce spikes in air pollution and traffic flows —a question sparsely attended to in the literature. Short-term driving bans—as opposed to long-term restrictions—might induce different behavioral responses on affected drivers. Santiago's policy restricts drivers with a less-than-one probability, which might mitigate some of the incentives to purchase a second car. Useful insights on the efficacy of short-term measures to curb surges in airborne pollution are in Mullins and Bharadwaj (2015), who evaluate the impact of Santiago's environmental episodes on particulate matter concentrations. While informative, however, the analysis in Mullins and Bharadwaj (2015) focuses on the entire suite of actions implemented by these episodes, without unraveling the particular role that short-term driving bans have on improving the city's air quality. Moreover, environmental episodes trigger not only driving restrictions, but also a set of other actions that target stationary source pollution. Hence, a deeper understanding of these episodes and their short-term measures is necessary for correct advising to policymakers on devising mechanisms for curbing airborne contamination.====To evaluate the impact of short-term driving bans, I use high-frequency data from 2000 to 2015 on ambient concentrations of four major pollutants from automotive emissions: heavy and fine particulate matter (PM==== and PM====, respectively), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen oxides (NO====). A nice feature of high-frequency data on the concentration of these pollutants is the possibility of controlling for atmospheric persistence, widely known to affect pollution concentrations (Gibson and Carnovale, 2015; Zhang et al., 2017). Additionally, I look at hourly vehicle trips recorded by counting stations, and at the number of trips taken in both Santiago's Metro and Santiago's bus rapid transit system ====.====I explore causality through a fuzzy regression discontinuity (FRD) design that uses the air quality index as the variable forcing the probability of an episode. The FRD approach exploits the arbitrary cutoffs in the air quality index that define the different episodes and accounts for potential confounding factors by defining a narrow window around these cutoffs.==== I evaluate both the overall episodes’ impact in a pooled FRD and their individual effectiveness in a multiple cutoff FRD. The time span between the issuance of an episode and the implementation of its mitigation actions rules out potential unobservables that could simultaneously affect both the forcing and the outcome variables. Additionally, the use of high-frequency data on traffic flows allows me to isolate the effects of driving restrictions from other mitigation actions triggered by these episodes but targeting stationary source emissions. The robustness of the data available represents one of the main contributions of this study.====Results show that temporary driving restrictions effectively keep drivers off the roads during days of critical air pollution. Specifically, environmental episodes reduce average vehicle trips by roughly 6–9 percent during peak hours and by 7–8 percent during off-peak hours, rejecting the existence of a shift in driving towards unrestricted hours. The results indicate an increase in the daily use of mass-transit systems as well, mostly in Santiago's subway and during off-peak hours, suggesting that restricted drivers trend towards substituting alternative modes of transportation that run with excess capacity. Average pollution concentrations also decrease by 1–2 percent, mostly PM====, while the results on hourly maximum concentrations indicate a 2–3 percent reduction in PM====, PM====, and CO. A back-of-the-envelope calculation based on these results indicates that the impact of this policy on heavy particulate matter is valued at US$194–388 million per year.====When allowing for heterogeneous effects, the results indicate reductions in hourly average and hourly maximum vehicle trips, mostly during the most severe episode when temporary driving bans restrict a significant amount of cars. For days with pre-emergencies (and emergencies), average car trips are curtailed by 5–15 percent during peak-hours, and by 8 percent during early off-peak hours. Yet, additional evidence suggests that some drivers might be changing their driving patterns towards routes where enforcement is less likely, which leads to causal impacts that are smaller than expected. Results on average pollution concentrations offer mixed findings, although further estimations controlling for pollution trends suggest reductions in airborne concentrations of all the four pollutants, particularly of CO and NO====. The results also indicate a positive impact on mass-transit ridership during the most severe episode and notably during off-peak hours, which uncover the importance of alternatives modes of transportation in securing the effectiveness of this policy while shedding light on the significance of complementary efforts when it comes to curbing local air pollution.====The plan of this paper is laid out as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature and highlights the contributions of the present study. Section 3 provides background details on Santiago's policy, while Section 4 describes the data.

We analyze the sensitivity of the equilibrium to changes in the trading costs and firms' allocations, and characterize situations where the trading costs depress or raise permit prices relative to frictionless market conditions. We calibrate our model to annual transaction data in Phase II of the ==== (2008–2012) and find that trading costs in the order of 10 k€ per annum plus 1 € per permit traded substantially reduce discrepancies between observations and theoretical predictions for firms’ behavior (e.g. autarkic compliance for small and/or long firms). Our simulations suggest that ignoring trading costs leads to an underestimation of the price impacts of supply-curbing policies, this difference varying with the incidence on firms.","Stemming from the seminal works of Coase (1960), Crocker (1966) and Dales (1968) and later formalized by Montgomery (1972), emissions trading has become pivotal in the environmental and climate change mitigation regulatory toolbox.==== Purportedly, comparative advantages of this instrument include cost effectiveness, modest information requirements for the regulator and a political-economy lever by means of the initial distribution of emissions permits. The collective optimum can in principle be decentralized via the market price: given a total supply of permits, the same price level emerges in equilibrium and abatement efforts are rerouted to firms with lowest marginal abatement costs irrespective of their initial allocation as a result of market participants’ endeavor to ferret out least-expensive abatement sources.====As two of the concept's founding fathers recognize in the opening quotes, however, a variety of barriers to trading – usually grouped under the notion of transaction costs – can drive a wedge between theoretical and practical market outcomes. In practice, indeed, frictions of various types are acknowledged to be pervasive as the empirical literature on permit markets attests (e.g. Carlson et al., 2000; Gangadharan, 2000; Hahn and Stavins, 2011; Jaraitė-Kažukauskė and Kažukauskas, 2015; Venmans, 2016; Karpf et al., 2018; Naegele, 2018; Cludius and Betz, 2020) and, more generally, there are costs associated with trading in financial markets (e.g. Gârleanu and Pedersen, 2013; Dávila and Parlatore, 2021, and references therein). We corroborate these findings with a descriptive analysis of trading and compliance patterns in the second phase of the EU Emissions Trading System (2008–12) that suggests the existence of transaction costs. This echoes one conclusion of Hintermann et al. (2016) who review the literature on market and price behaviors in EU ETS Phase II, i.e. transaction costs impinge on price formation and may explain persisting differentials in marginal abatement costs across firms.====Yet, surprisingly, the prevalence of transaction costs and their implications for market outcomes as well as for policy design, evaluation and implementation are largely ignored in the theoretical literature on permit markets, with only a few exceptions discussed below.==== In this paper, we seek to remedy this gap. Specifically, we incorporate trading costs in an otherwise archetypal permit trading model to formally study how they impact the market equilibrium. We also calibrate the model to observed transactions in EU ETS Phase II to offer an illustration based on a relevant real-world example. As we shall see, not only is such a framework better equipped to conduct finer-grained ex-post analyses of firms’ trading and compliance behaviors, but it also constitutes a more realistic basis for ex-ante assessments of supply-side management policies, a regular feature in the hybrid ETSs of today.====We articulate three contributions to the literature. To motivate our analysis further, we begin by exploring the universe of annual transactions in EU ETS Phase II, our policy environment in this paper. Data is available at the account (installation) level but we consider the firm as the relevant decision-making unit for our analysis and we concentrate on inter-firm trading.==== To aggregate the data at the firm level and remove intra-firm permit reallocations, we develop a consolidation methodology matching each installation to a parent company building on an iterative search procedure for duplicates in the accounts' information fields. We then utilize the consolidated dataset to scrutinize firms' annual trading and compliance behaviors. The consolidation methodology and the description of observed firms’ market behavior constitute our first contribution to the empirical literature on the EU ETS.====We find evidence of autarkic compliance and signs of impaired trading, i.e. some gains from trade go unrealized at both the extensive and intensive margins, see Ellerman et al. (2010), Martin et al. (2015) and Schleich et al. (2020) for similar descriptive results. At the extensive margin, about a third of firms did not trade at all on a yearly basis. Autarkic firms are mostly small (in terms of size of emissions or number of installations) representing 9% of regulated emissions and often hold excess permits (w.r.t. realized emissions). At the intensive margin, active firms engaged in trading rather infrequently (typically a few times per year) and only for large enough volumes, suggesting that marginal abatement costs are not equalized across firms in equilibrium. Stifled trade at both margins points us to the prevalence of both fixed and variable transaction costs (see also Stavins, 1995; Singh and Weninger, 2017).====Our second contribution to the literature is theoretical in nature. We enrich a standard static and deterministic permit trading model by introducing both fixed and proportional trading costs. The fixed cost impacts firms' decisions to take part in the market (extensive margin) while the proportional cost further affects firms' trading choices by driving a wedge between their marginal abatement costs (intensive margin). In our equilibrium framework, the permit price and firms' participation in and extent of trading are determined endogenously, and they depend on the given trading costs and firms’ characteristics (i.e. abatement costs and permit allocations, where we let some firms be initially overallocated).==== Importantly, this framework enables us to study when a market equilibrium exists and if so, how it is achieved.====Tracking trading cost impacts through buyer-seller interactions and resulting market prices, we can analyze the sensitivity of the market equilibrium to changes in the trading costs and firms' initial allocations. While an increase in trading costs always reduces cost effectiveness and the volume of trade, its price effects are ambiguous and non-monotonic in general as they depend on its relative impacts on the supply and demand sides of the market. As a rule, we find that trading costs are conducive to higher price levels when the (theoretical) frictionless market price is ‘low’, and vice versa. Similarly, the price increase following a reduction in the total number of permits can be amplified or dampened in the presence of trading costs. This hinges on a distribution effect (the overall impact on net permit demand, holding the price constant) and a price effect (the relative price elasticity of net permit demand with vs. without trading costs) which are generally countervailing. To gain additional insight into the market impacts of trading costs, we illustrate our results with analytical and numerical examples for different distributions of the firms' characteristics.====The benchmark framework to analyze the impacts of transaction costs in permit markets has been developed by Stavins (1995) and extended by Montero (1998).==== Crucially, however, this is not an equilibrium framework and the market price is taken as exogenously fixed. That is, Stavins and Montero study the impacts of trading costs on an individual firm's emission and trading choices at the margin but do not formally characterize the market price impacts nor how firms self-select into costly trading in the first place as we do in this paper. As a result, our framework sometimes leads to different results, e.g. market outcomes are sensitive to the initial allocation of permits even with constant marginal trading costs. More recently, Singh and Weninger (2017) have developed a similar equilibrium framework in the presence of fixed or proportional trading costs, alternatively.==== But in their model, firms are ex-ante identical and differ only in idiosyncratic productivity shocks – the only motive for permit trade. Our analysis is hence different in nature as we choose to focus on what we believe to be the more practically relevant case of ex-ante heterogeneous firms.====This brings us to our third contribution to the literature, which exploits firms' heterogeneity in abatement costs and allocations allowed by the model. Specifically, we utilize the universe of yearly allocations, emissions, transactions and prices in EU ETS Phase II to discipline the calibration of model parameters and the selection of practically relevant trading costs values. We propose a selection criterion minimizing the total number of sorting errors (i.e. discrepancies between firms' market participation and net market positions in the model vs. the data) and their dispersion across error types (measured by Shannon's entropy).==== Respectively, we find fixed and proportional trading costs in the order of 5–25 k€ per annum and 0.5–1.5 € per permit traded (or 8–11% of the permit price) across years. Relative to zero trading costs, the selected trading costs reduce the total number of sorting errors by 40%, their dispersion by 160%, and can rationalize 70% of autarkic compliance cases. Our model calibration exercise thus shows how accounting for trading costs can be important for ex-post policy evaluation. It also provides first-pass estimates of trading costs in the EU ETS where related empirical studies have gathered anecdotal or indirect evidence (e.g. Karpf et al., 2018; Zaklan, 2021) or utilized econometric estimation techniques, obtaining results of similar orders of magnitude (e.g. Medina et al., 2014; Jaraitė-Kažukauskė and Kažukauskas, 2015; Naegele, 2018).====Finally, we leverage our calibrated model to compare the quantitative results that a modeler or regulator would obtain in assessing the total costs the ETS imposes on firms or the market price impacts of additional supply-curbing policies, depending on whether or not transaction costs are accounted for. In our setting, extra compliance costs resulting from incurred trading costs and foregone efficiency gains are in the order of 7% of the compliance costs in a scenario where transaction costs are ignored. In a similar vein, we find that the price increase following a reduction in the total number of permits would be underestimated if one does not account for transaction costs. This is because in our setting some firms holding excess permits do not offer them for sale due to the transaction costs, implying that the price increase is inefficiently large. Specifically, we find an underestimation factor of two for a one-sixth reduction in the total cap, with variations in size of up to 30–40% depending on its incidence on firms.====The remainder is structured as follows. Section 2 provides background information on transaction costs and trading patterns in EU ETS Phase II. Section 3 develops the permit trading model in the presence of fixed and proportional trading costs and presents our theoretical results. Section 4.1 describes the model calibration and the selection of trading costs. Section 4.2 utilizes the calibrated model to evaluate supply-tightening policy impacts in the presence vs. absence of trading costs. Section 5 contextualizes our results within the existing literature and discusses some limitations of our analysis. Section 6 concludes.

Their effectiveness strongly depends on household and individual traits. The existing evidence in economics and psychology points to the role of environmental values and identity in determining pro-environmental behavior and the impact of social information. In a large field experiment on household energy conservation, we combine electricity metering and survey data to test whether the impact of a social information program can be strengthened by leveraging environmental values and identity. We experimentally augment social information messages with an environmental self-identity prime. The self-identity prime does not strengthen the effectiveness of a social information program on average. Nonetheless, we find suggestive evidence that priming environmental self-identity can be effective if targeted to specific sub-groups.","Social information programs are widely used by policymakers to nudge behavioural change. Their popularity is attributable, at least in part, to existing evidence on their ability to influence behaviour in a variety of settings, from energy and water consumption (Allcott et al., 2011; Allcott and Rogers, 2014; Ayres et al., 2013; Brent et al., 2015; Ferraro et al., 2013; Ferraro et al., 2011; Ferraro and Miranda, 2013; Jaime Torres and Carlsson, 2018), contributions to charitable causes (Frey and Meier, 2004; Shang and Croson, 2009), voting (Gerber and Rogers, 2009) and financial decisions (Beshears et al., 2015). While this literature has been ubiquitous in showing that social comparisons work, there is still uncertainty about why this is the case, and on sources of heterogeneity in their impact. One prominent explanation is that messages conveying information on others' conduct draw individuals’ attention to a target behaviour and increase the moral cost of deviating from it (Schultz et al., 2007; Allcott, 2011).====A large literature in psychology discusses the influence of individual values on the impact of interventions fostering socially desirable conduct (Schwartz, 1992; Ghesla et al., 2020; Steg et al., 2015). According to this perspective, policy measures are contextual factors, which make certain values more salient (Steg, 2016). Salient values, in turn, are given larger weight in decision-making. In particular, evidence shows that values affect behavior by activating specific dimensions of an individual's self-identity, and argue that the desire to be consistent with one's salient identity is a strong motivator of value-compliant behavior (van der Werff et al., 2013b; 2014b).====In this paper we examine how identity affects the impact of social information interventions on a larger scale than the one typical of studies in psychology: on a behavioral outcome requiring prolonged effort; and through an experimental approach. First, we conduct exploratory analysis to test two hypotheses of identity theory. We investigate whether the impact of social information is higher, the stronger the personal values attached to the target behaviour by the individual. We also examine whether such effect occurs by making the corresponding dimension of self-identity salient, and whether it weakens over time, consistent with a salience-inducing mechanism. Second, drawing from the findings of this exploratory analysis and pre-existing evidence, we test whether directly manipulating the salience of individuals’ value-congruent self-identity can strengthen the influence of a social information program on the desired behaviour, and explore sources of heterogeneity in this effect.====Like other studies in the social information literature, we address these questions in the context of household energy conservation.==== The social information program that we study is a large scale randomized intervention, providing customers of a European utility with information on how their energy use compares to that of their neighbors (Allcott, 2011; Allcott and Rogers, 2014). Such information is included in a Home Energy Report, distributed to customers via email (eHER). We experimentally manipulate self-identity by augmenting the standard eHER with an environmental self-identity prime. The prime, which was pre-tested online, draws from the literature on environmental self-identity by making past pro-environmental actions salient. To explore potential sources of heterogeneous impacts of these messages, we combine administrative data on consumption with survey data on a sub-sample of 4835 customers. This is similar to Byrne et al. (2018), which investigates the heterogeneous response to an energy conservation program from survey data on a sub-sample of almost 1200 program recipients and control households.====Our results paint a more nuanced role for values and identity than the one offered by pre-existing evidence. First, our exploratory analysis of sources of heterogeneity in the impact of the eHER reveals that environmental values are not conducive to energy reduction in response to an energy conservation nudge by themselves. We find, however, suggestive evidence that high environmental values increase the energy savings among program recipients with high baseline energy use. Second, we confirm that the eHER affects environmental self-identity by increasing its salience, as this effect is short-lived. Third, leveraging environmental values by making environmental self-identity more salient within the eHER does not increase the effectiveness of social information on average.==== When we explore potential sources of heterogeneity in the impact of the self-identity prime, we find weak evidence that targeting a specific group of utility customers– users with high baseline energy consumption who behaved pro-environmentally in the past – can lead to energy savings.====Our study makes four main contributions to the literature. First, we contribute to the psychological literature on values and identity (Schwartz, 1992; Dunlap et al., 1983; de Groot and Steg, 2008; Steg et al., 2014b), by showing how to leverage values through the content of communication in a novel field setting, and discussing the limitations of this strategy. While extensive, the existing literature mainly relies on correlational evidence or on mediation analysis to establish causality (Nordlund and Garvill, 2016; Steg et al., 2005, Stern et al., 1995; Thøgersen and Ölander, 2002; van der Werff et al., 2013a). The few existing experimental studies adopting the same self-identity prime that we use, mainly examine outcomes measured through self-reports (Cornelissen et al., 2008; van der Werff et al., 2014a,2014b), or that require little or no effort or cost (Cornelissen et al., 2008). Our online pre-test falls within this class of studies, and yields similarly strong results on the ability of self-identity primes to foster pro-environmental behaviour. In contrast, our field experiment reveals that the effect of priming is null overall, and weakly statistically significant only within specific groups of users when the outcome requires sustained behavioural change.====Second, the nature of our identity prime also allows us to speak to the open question on whether past moral deeds prompt behavioural consistency – thus generating positive spillovers (Susewind and Hoelzl, 2014; van der Werff et al., 2014a; Truelove et al., 2014)– or rather provide moral credits that can lead to compensatory actions -i.e. negative spillovers (Sachdeva et al., 2009; Truelove et al., 2014; Jordan et al., 2011; Tiefenbeck et al., 2013; Mazar and Zhong, 2010). To the best of our knowledge, our study provides the first evidence, albeit weak, of positive spillover effects from priming past behaviour on real world costly actions, among those individuals who acted pro-environmentally in the past.====Third, our results on how the eHER's impact on identity varies over time are consistent with evidence from Allcott and Rogers (2014) using daily energy use data, thus identifying a potential mechanism behind the temporal pattern of social information programs' effect.====Fourth, our study is one of the first to investigate the impact of a social information program in a European country, namely Italy. The existing literature is almost exclusively based on US samples.==== We only weakly echo in our setting the seminal results from Costa and Kahn (2013), which analyze heterogeneity with respect to political preference and revealed preference measures of environmental ideology.==== We also confirm the presence of boomerang effects: social information results in higher energy use among customers with low baseline consumption (Byrne et al., 2018; Bhanot, 2017), in spite of the other program features aimed at preventing such boomerang effects (Schultz et al., 2007).====These findings have implications for the design and targeting of social information programs. In particular, we discuss the need for caution when deriving policy implications from controlled laboratory studies, however well designed. As for targeting, we propose ways to exploit identity priming through targeting to specific sub-groups. The increasing customization and digitalization of communication from energy utilities, together with the low marginal cost of these forms of communication, make targeting even small and specific, but responsive, groups of customers potentially cost-effective and policy relevant. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides details of the design and data of the randomized controlled trial.

Results from our ==== suggest that the average state responds to a reduction in its per-facility environmental agency budget by decreasing the fraction of large RCRA facilities receiving inspections and enforcement actions. We also find evidence that a reduction in a state's environmental budget may result in a substitution away from resource-intensive on-site inspections to lower-cost off-site inspections. If the latter type of inspection is relatively less effective in detecting violations, then this substitution is likely to lead to poorer environmental outcomes. Overall our results suggest that decreases in EPA funding for state environmental agencies and further devolution of responsibility for environmental programs to states may result in lower levels of environmental protection in some areas.","In many countries across the world, central governments share responsibilities for implementing policy with sub-national authorities. The COVID-19 pandemic has put a spotlight on the crucial administrative roles of state and local authorities within the U.S. federalist system. In the context of U.S. environmental policy, most states hold primary responsibility for the administration and implementation of key environmental statutes while the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) serves as overseer and regulatory backstop. A key advantage of decentralization is the ability for local authorities to implement regulations in ways that maximize local welfare by taking into account local preferences, knowledge, and constraints (Millimet, 2013). Because these factors differ across locations, the flexibility inherent in an environmental federalist system gives rise to some variation across locations in the administration of federal environmental statutes, the resources devoted to environmental protection, and environmental quality. For example, we may see relatively more resources devoted to education than to environmental protection in a state whose citizens more highly value educational attainment compared to environmental quality. While states have some latitude in their administration of federal environmental regulations, they must meet federal minimum standards for regulatory stringency and enforcement. In theory, EPA ensures a minimum level of environmental protection in all states through its oversight role and its ability to revoke states’ primacy.====One important dimension of state environmental programs is the level of resources devoted to environmental protection. While it is relatively straightforward to document state differences in such resources, it is less obvious how variation in those resources translates into differences in environmental outcomes. The goal of this paper is to increase our understanding of how variation in state environmental agency budgets in particular contributes to differences in state monitoring and enforcement efforts. Ideally, we would examine the impact of budgets on environmental quality, but environmental quality is difficult to measure directly and there are no consistent and continuously-updated datasets that compare environmental quality across states and over time (Konisky and Woods, 2012). Therefore, we focus on variation in state monitoring and enforcement activities as an indirect indicator of environmental quality. While monitoring and enforcement activities capture only one part of a state's environmental performance, as Gray and Shimshack (2011) note, regulatory enforcement has been shown to be a dominant factor in improvements in developed countries' environmental quality.====More specifically, we explore the impact of state environmental agency budgets within the context of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the federal law that governs the management of hazardous and non-hazardous solid waste. We construct a panel dataset on state environmental agency budgets and RCRA monitoring and enforcement outcomes from 2011 to 2018, a period of increased devolution of enforcement responsibility to states and dampening of the federal EPA's oversight role. Results from fixed-effects linear regressions show that in state-years with higher environmental agency budgets per regulated facility, a larger percentage of RCRA facilities are inspected and the average state undertakes more enforcement actions per facility. While these results are informative, the presence of potential endogeneity prevents a causal interpretation. To address endogeneity concerns, we pursue an instrumental variables (IV) strategy, motivated by the crime literature (e.g., Evans and Owens, 2007), that uses EPA grant awards to states as an instrument for state environmental budgets. Once we account for the potential endogeneity of state environmental budgets, the results show a larger estimated impact of state environmental agency budgets on RCRA inspection and enforcement efforts. The sizes of these estimated effects indicate that a substantial portion, but not the majority, of the differences in the level of RCRA monitoring and enforcement across states can be explained by differences in funding. The results also suggest that a decrease in a state's environmental budget may result in an increase in the RCRA violation rate for hazardous waste facilities, as well as substitution away from resource-intensive on-site inspections to lower-cost off-site inspections.====Our estimates of the impact of state environmental agency budgets on RCRA monitoring and enforcement prove robust in sign and significance across a range of specifications. Specifically, we report the results of our analysis using both total state environmental agency budgets and waste-specific state agency budgets. We demonstrate that our results are not sensitive to the use of EPA grants as an instrument by estimating our model with a state tax revenue instrument in the spirit of Lin (2009). To address concerns that our instrumental variables strategy itself may be generating the apparent causal effects, we report results for two falsification tests. We also find results similar to our primary estimates when using an alternative propensity score estimator.====While there are numerous studies of the impact of monitoring and enforcement efforts on environmental compliance across various environmental media and programs (see Gray and Shimshack, 2011 for a survey), to our knowledge there are no papers that explore the role of state resources in explaining variation in monitoring and enforcement. Gray and Shimshack (2011) document trends in EPA's resources devoted to monitoring and enforcement, specifically EPA's budget and workforce, as well as trends in EPA monitoring and enforcement outcomes, but note that data challenges prevent a similar analysis at the state level. While we cannot limit our analysis to resources devoted solely to RCRA monitoring and enforcement, we document trends in overall state environmental agency budgets and RCRA-specific monitoring and enforcement efforts. Additionally, we provide new insights into the impact that changes in state environmental agency budgets have on both inspections and enforcement efforts in the RCRA program. These findings are particularly salient given recent devolution of responsibilities from the federal EPA to the states. As Konisky and Woods (2012, p. 544) note, the “degree of responsibility hoisted upon the states ebbs and flows with changes in presidential administrations” so results from this analysis are important not only to provide insight into the impact of recent changes but also to increase our understanding of the impact of our federalist system on heterogeneity in environmental protection in the long-run.",Regulating hazardous wastes under U.S. environmental federalism: The role of state resources,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069621000474,26 April 2021,2021,Research Article,159.0

We first focus on zoonotic disease ","Scientific consensus suggests that COVID-19 was transmitted to humans from wildlife (====; ====). Any such disease that is transferred from animals to humans through direct contact or though food, water, and the environment is commonly referred to as a zoonosis. Nearly two thirds of emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic, and three-quarters of them originate in wildlife (====; ====). Consequently, COVID-19 could be one of possibly many newly emerging zoonotic diseases that originate from a wild species.====There is growing evidence that land-use change is an important pathway for the transmission of zoonotic diseases from wildlife to humans (====; ====; ==== and ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Human activities that alter the landscape, such as land conversion and habitat fragmentation, increase the probability of animal–human interactions and thus disease transmission (====). As noted by ====, p. 399), “human land alteration continues to shift existing landscapes into island-like habitats with reduced area, increased isolation, and increased ratios of edge habitat to total area.” Studies also show that “deforestation resulting in crop monocultures is particularly problematic for elevating infection risks in susceptible nearby populations” (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Even diseases transmitted by bats – the suspected wildlife source of COVID-19 – are associated with increased habitat loss and human-wildlife interactions (====). As the biologist Thomas Lovejoy has noted, “This pandemic is the consequence of our persistent and excessive intrusion in nature.“====Only recently have models of infectious disease began incorporating land conversion leading to the possible spillover of disease and pathogens from wildlife to humans (====; ====). Economists are beginning to approach these issues by examining the pathways through which human interactions with the environment spread zoonotic diseases (====), exploring the role of animal farming and meat consumption in the emergence and amplification of infectious diseases (====), and modeling the relation between biodiversity loss and zoonotic pandemic risks (====).====The following paper develops an economic model of the costs and benefits of habitat conversion that also includes the risk of a zoonosis disease outbreak due to transmission from wildlife to humans. To do this, the paper focuses on a specific region with an initially given wildlife habitat area and human population. The paper therefore develops a model of optimal habitat conversion that also includes the risk of an initial zoonosis disease outbreak due to transmission from wildlife to humans in the same region that the habitat conversion takes place. Thus, the planner must take into account both the normal cost and benefits associated with converting wildlife habitat (e.g. benefits of conversion to agriculture or the ecosystem benefits associated with preserving wildlife habitat) as well as the risk that smaller habitat will increase the risk of establishing primary cases of infection in the human population and the disutility if this disease outbreak occurs.====The model is developed in two stages. Using basic principles of dynamic models of a zoonosis disease spillover to humans (====; ====; ====), we first establish how wildlife-human transmission can be affected by the size of the habitat area occupied by the wildlife population carrying the pathogen. It follows that declining habitat area increases the rate of contact between humans and infected wildlife, influences the expected occurrence of a primary case of infection among humans, and thus determines whether a disease outbreak among humans occurs. Consequently, efficient and optimal conversion of the habitat must take into account any impacts on the risks of an outbreak occurring.====To illustrate this, we next develop a model of converting wildlife habitat into land that is valued as an input into commercially marketed activities while the remaining habitat yields wider environmental benefits (e.g. biodiversity, recreation and tourism values and a wide range of ecosystem services). Our approach is related to models of optimal habitat conversion among competing uses, such as conservation as opposed to development (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). However, we extend such an approach so that allocating natural habitat across competing uses must also take into account the potential risk of a zoonosis disease outbreak as wildlife habitat declines. If the social disutility from a disease outbreak caused by wildlife habitat loss is extremely high compared to the benefits from conversion, then no conversion should take place and the initial wildlife habitat area should be preserved indefinitely. But even if some habitat conversion is optimal, the decision to convert must include a risk premium for the threat of an outbreak, which is impacted by the size of the remaining habitat area, the adverse impact of loss of habitat on the likelihood of the disease outbreak, and the negative value associated with an increase in the risk that a zoonosis disease outbreak occurs. Compared to this case where no account is taken of the impact of wildlife habitat loss on the risk of disease outbreak, more wildlife habitat will therefore be conserved.====These outcomes are captured in a numerical simulation. The scenarios confirm that accounting for the impact of wildlife habitat loss on the risk of disease outbreak ensures that more wildlife habitat will be conserved in the long run. However, because this risk is inversely impacted by habitat size, proportionately more of the habitat is conserved if the initial habitat area is smaller. If the area is too small, then no conversion should take place. We also show that any policy to control habitat conversion, such as a ==== imposed on the rents from converted land, should vary with habitat area.====Our theoretical and numerical results have important policy implications. As long as there is significant risk of a zoonosis disease outbreak due to wildlife habitat loss, then more habitat needs to be conserved than in the case where that risk is insignificant or does not exist. How much more should be conserved will depend on the size of the habitat area, which confirms the concern that many zoonosis disease experts have over how land conversion is leading to the fragmentation of larger wildlife habitats into island-like habitats with reduced area, increased isolation, and increased ratios of edge habitat to other areas occupied by humans (====; ====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Control and regulation of converting wildlife habitat is essential, if there is a significant risk of zoonosis disease outbreak.====The numerical simulation of how the risk of disease outbreak impacts wildlife habitat conservation in the long run is based on the following functional forms and key relationships.",Habitat loss and the risk of disease outbreak,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069621000346,13 April 2021,2021,Research Article,160.0

We combine data at the county-by-day level on confirmed cases and deaths with information on local air quality and weather conditions. Following Deryugina et al. (2019), we instrument short-term variation in local concentrations of particulate matter (PM10) by region-specific daily variation in wind directions. We find significant positive effects of PM10 concentration on death numbers from four days before to ten days after the onset of symptoms. Specifically, for elderly patients (80+ years) an increase in ambient PM10 concentration by one ==== between two and four days after developing symptoms increases the number of deaths by 19 percent of a standard deviation. In addition, higher levels air pollution raise the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 for all age groups. The timing of effects surrounding the onset of illness suggests that air pollution affects the severity of already-realized infections. We discuss the implications of our results for immediate policy levers to reduce the exposure and level of ambient air pollution, as well as for cost-benefit considerations of policies aiming at sustainable longer-term reductions of pollution levels.","The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has sparked the largest public health and economic crisis in recent history. To date, with millions of confirmed cases the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has claimed more than 1.5 million deaths globally.==== World Bank projections of economic damage range up to a 5.2 percent contraction in global GDP, which would be the deepest recession in decades (====). Pressing social and economic issues that had dominated the public debate – most notably environmental issues of climate change and pollution – had almost vanished for a time and only slowly re-emerged.====In this paper, we show that environmental pollution and the COVID-19 pandemic are significantly connected: higher levels of local air pollution increase the number of deaths of COVID-19, leading to a more severe course of the pandemic. Three plausible mechanisms link air pollution to the spread and course of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and influenza-like illnesses (ILI). First, long-run exposure to air pollution is linked to medical pre-conditions such as illnesses of the respiratory system, which can exacerbate the course of the disease (====; ====; ====; ====; ====). Second, short-term exposure to air pollution leads to inflammatory reactions and lower immune responses to new infections (====; ====; ====). Third, higher levels of air pollution increase the risk of airborne infection of viruses by prolonging the time that the virus remains in open air (====; ====). Our empirical setup focusing on day-to-day changes in pollution before and after the onset of symptoms allows us to discriminate between these mechanisms.====Against this background, we add to the epidemiological literature empirically linking levels of different air pollutants to the onset and severity of SARI and ILI in general, and the new COVID-19 disease specifically. We study the interaction of short-term exposure to ambient air pollution, measured by levels of particulate matter (PM10) in German counties, and the number of newly-confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19. We instrument levels of PM10 by exploiting region-specific relationships between wind direction and air pollution following ====. Fixed effects for county and date keep county-specific time-invariant and national time-variant confounding variables constant. We further control for several potentially confounding variables: weather conditions, the county-specific state of the pandemic, local mobility patterns based on mobile phone movements, county-specific requirements for wearing face masks in public as well as state-specific fixed effects for the different policy regimes implemented in response to the first wave of the pandemic between spring and early summer of 2020 in Germany.====) over the period between two and four days after the onset of illness increases the number of deaths among male patients by about 1.2 deaths per 100K members of the population per day, or about 19 percent of a standard deviation. Effect patterns for women are similar, yet less pronounced. Additionally, we find that air pollution just before as well as after the onset of illness leads to increased numbers of confirmed cases across the entire age distribution, which is likely explained by aggravated symptoms persuading patients to get tested.====By isolating the causal effect of air pollution on the severity of COVID-19, we complement and confirm earlier descriptive evidence based on cross-sectional and time series variation (see ==== for a systematic review). To the best of our knowledge, there are few studies estimating quasi-experimental causal links between air pollution and ILI or respiratory disease severity. ==== exploit differential timing of the Spanish flu pandemic across U.S. cities to show that contemporary short-term air pollution levels increased the number of deaths. ==== show that U.S. county-by-month influenza-related hospitalizations increase with higher air pollution. With respect to the COVID-19 pandemic, ==== show that air pollution – instrumented by a rollback of environmental regulations in the U.S. – increases both the number of cases and case fatality of COVID-19. Also for the U.S., ==== apply the same IV approach using county-level variation in wind directions to study the impact of fine particle concentrations on the number of cases and deaths of COVID-19.====We add to these more closely-related papers in two important ways. First, it is yet to be determined whether results from previous pandemics and/or other regional settings are generalizable to other external settings, in case of both disease and locality. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to provide evidence on the linkage between air pollution and the spread and severity of COVID-19 for Germany. Second, we use fine-grained data on daily pollution levels, which allows us to identify critical time windows relative to the onset of the illness when pollution levels most crucially affect the mortality risk. This allows us to discriminate between different mechanisms at play. As effects materialize just before and mainly after the onset of illness, our results support mechanisms causing inflammatory reactions, reducing the immune response and aggravating symptoms. Our results do not support proposed mechanisms of higher ability of the virus to cause airborne infections due to higher air pollution. By focusing on short-term changes in the exposure to air pollution, our results do not speak to potential effects through longer-run exposure to air pollution on respiratory pre-conditions.====We discuss three groups of policy instruments that may be justified by the results of this paper: first, any policy that reduces the ==== of vulnerable patients towards ambient air pollution might lead to a reduced mortality of COVID-19; second, policies that directly reduce ==== of air pollution should be considered; and third, our results confirm that policies that sustainably reduce pollution levels will have substantial health effects through reduced severity of respiratory diseases.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section ==== discusses plausible mechanisms through which higher air pollution might affect the onset and severity of COVID-19 and summarizes the related literature. Section ==== describes the data and provides a descriptive overview of the course of the pandemic in Germany. Section ==== describes our empirical approach.

Each sample faces a different payment frequency (for instance, 1, 5, 10) together with a randomly assigned bid vector; both the frequency of payments and the bid are fixed for a specific individual. This paper evaluates whether allowing respondents to choose their preferred payment frequency affects the estimated discount rate. We use data from a ==== survey of a network of marine reserves and estimate discount rates using both an exogenous and endogenous approach. The former calculates the mean of the willingness to pay (WTP) for each sample and then finds the discount rate that makes the present value of each payment frequency equivalent. The latter estimates the WTP and the discount rate jointly. Results show that allowing people to choose the payment schedule significantly reduces the implicit discount rate. We observed the highest reductions in discount rates when we used all the information available from the valuation questions to bound the WTP distribution. Our analysis suggests that the exogenous approach would not be recommended for testing the adequacy of people’s responses to the frequency of payments.","Many economists now believe that the implied discount rate—or subjective rate of time preferences—estimated from stated preferences (SP) using different payment frequencies is “====” (Egan et al., 2015; Lew, 2018; Myers et al., 2017). This phenomenon has been known as ==== in the nonmarket valuation literature (Bateman and Langford, 1997a, Bateman and Langford, 1997b; Carson et al., 1997; Faccioli et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2006; Kahneman and Knetsch, 1992; Stevens et al., 1997). However, studies in experimental economics and transportation also find high discount rates, sometimes even higher than those found in SP studies (Andreoni and Sprenger, 2012; Andreoni et al., 2015; Cheung, 2019; Wang and Daziano, 2015).====The literature addressing implicit discount rates is vast, including studies on transportation, adoption of technologies, the value of statistical life, and environmental valuation (Anderson and Newell, 2004; Andersson et al., 2013; Grammatikopoulou et al., 2020; Lew, 2018; Wang and Daziano, 2015; Wang and He, 2018). From this literature, we found 16 articles satisfying two criteria: 1) they use SP to estimate both the implicit discount rate (discount rate, hereafter) and the willingness to pay (WTP); and 2) they use variation in the frequency of payments.====Our review shows that contingent valuation (CV) dominates this literature stream, characterizing 15 out of 16 articles (see Table 1). Lew (2018) is the only application using choice experiments (CEs). Recently, Grammatikopoulou et al. (2020) used CE, but we did not include this paper in our selection because they do not vary the payment frequency. Instead, they have the same frequency (10 years) with three different time delays (0, 3, and 6 years).====Moreover, all the selected articles use a split-sample approach in which each sample faces a different payment schedule together with a randomly assigned bid vector (BID). For instance, one sample faces a one-time payment, while another faces a 5- or a 10-payment schedule (1, 5, 10, and 15 periods are widespread in the literature).====Most of the selected studies use an exogenous approach to estimate the discount rate. In this approach, the discount rate is estimated “outside” the valuation exercise (Howard et al., 2020; Lew, 2018; Wang and Daziano, 2015). The exogenous method calculates the mean WTP for each sample and then finds the discount rate that makes the present value (PV) of each payment frequency equivalent (Kovacs and Larson, 2008). The endogenous approach though takes advantage of the variation in the payment frequency across samples to jointly estimate the WTP and the discount rate (Bond et al., 2009; Howard et al., 2020; Kovacs and Larson, 2008; Meyer, 2013a, 2013b; Vasquez-Lavín et al., 2019).====Some of these articles found a “surprisingly” high discount rate (Crocker and Shogren, 1993; Kim and Haab, 2009; Lew, 2018; Myers et al., 2017; Stevens et al., 1997). For instance, values for the discount rate are above 500% in some cases (Bond et al., 2009; Echeverría et al., 1995; Myers et al., 2017) and 200–350% (Myers et al., 2017; Stevens et al., 1997; Wang and He, 2018), 100–151% (Chen et al., 2014; Egan et al., 2015; Kahneman and Knetsch, 1992; Kim and Haab, 2009; Stevens et al., 1997; Wang and He, 2018), 50–100% (Egan et al., 2015) or below 50% (Stumborg et al., 2001) in other cases.====There are fewer estimations of the discount rate using the endogenous approach. The reported values are in the order of 23–80% (Bond et al., 2009), 30% (Howard et al., 2020; Kovacs and Larson, 2008), 121–285% (Lew, 2018), and 60–340% (Vasquez-Lavín et al., 2019). The only three comparisons between exogenous and endogenous approaches using the same data were reported by Kovacs and Larson (2008), Bond et al. (2009), and Howard et al. (2020). The evidence regarding which approach provides higher discount rates is mixed. In the study of Kovacs and Larson (2008), the endogenous method provides lower discount rates than the exogenous approach. The discount rates from Bond et al. (2009) using the exogenous method (provided by Myers et al. (2017)) are, in one case, extremely high (1,315%), while the other two values are either similar or lower than some estimates using the endogenous approach (61% and 5.85%, respectively). Finally, Howard et al. (2020) found similar discount rates between the exogenous and endogenous approach, with only one outlier (200%) using the endogenous one and a random parameter model. The other two studies using the endogenous approach (Lew, 2018; Vasquez-Lavín et al., 2019) provide discount rates that are, in some cases, higher than several others using the exogenous one. Given that the results seem to be considerably context-dependent, many authors note the need for more research on this issue (Boyle, 2017; Cook et al., 2018; Johnston et al., 2017).====Another characteristic common to all these studies is that an individual faces only one of various possible payment schedules (1, 5, 10 years, or perpetuity) (Echeverría et al., 1995). However, in many real markets, people have some flexibility to choose the frequency of payments for the goods they want to buy. Even in the few CEs found in the literature, researchers keep the frequency of payments fixed among the alternatives presented to individuals (Grammatikopoulou et al., 2020; Lew, 2018). Only one paper (Brouwer et al., 2008) offers respondents the option to choose the number of payment periods, but it does so sequentially such that they cannot take advantage of this information to estimate the discount rate.====This paper evaluates whether estimated discount rates can be reduced by allowing respondents to choose the payment frequency provided in a CV survey. We show that the discount rates are indeed reduced significantly by following this approach.====In our application, we compare two different surveys to estimate the WTP and the discount rate for five marine protected areas (MPAs) in Chile. The first survey follows the traditional split-sample approach, with three different payment schedules: payments for 1, 5, and 10 years and a BID randomly assigned to each individual. In this version of the survey, respondents cannot choose the payment schedule. In the second survey, we provide respondents with the same options—1, 5, or 10 years (and the option of not paying)—and ask them to choose one and discard the others. We compare the discount rate from each approach using both the exogenous and endogenous ones. Our application resembles the payment card and the double-bounded method used in the CV literature (Champ et al., 2012). It would also work with the rank-ordered logit approach used by Lew (2018), but unlike this author, we vary both the BID and the frequency of payments among the alternatives presented to the respondents.====This paper presents two novel contributions to the literature. First, to the best of our knowledge, all previous studies estimating discount rates using SP did not allow respondents to choose their payment frequency. In our opinion, a CV study should create a scenario with situations as similar as possible to those encountered in real markets. When people want to buy durable goods, they hardly ever face a fixed payment schedule. Conversely, people generally decide jointly the amount of money they will pay and the number of payments they will make.==== In our application, we replicate this scenario, presenting respondents with four alternatives: not purchasing the good or paying in 1, 5, or 10 annual payments whose value varies among the options.====Second, we argue, using a simple example, that the estimation of the implicit discount rate using the exogenous approach would not constitute a good practice for testing the adequacy of people’s responses to the frequency of payments. The exogenous approach is based on the premise that a CV scenario asks people about the PV of a flow of benefits provided by an environmental good. Instead, CV asks people whether the PV of the payment alternatives is lower than the PV of the benefits. Although this might seem like a subtle difference, it implies that if we do not consider the (unknown) total value of the good, we cannot say anything about the consistency of people’s responses under the exogenous approach. Comparing two PVs of payments does not reveal a subjective rate of time preferences but a ==== that makes two payment schedules equally desirable (same PV). This ====, although high, could be entirely consistent with a low discount rate.",Estimating discount rates for environmental goods: Are People’s responses inadequate to frequency of payments?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069621000292,20 March 2021,2021,Research Article,163.0

We evaluate the emissions reductions from electric vehicles (EVs) by identifying which vehicles would have been purchased had EVs not been available. We do so by estimating a random coefficients discrete choice model of new vehicle demand and simulating counterfactual sales with EVs no longer subsidized or removed from the new vehicle market. Our results suggest that vehicles that EVs replace are relatively fuel-efficient: EVs replace gasoline vehicles with an average fuel economy of 4.2 mpg above the fleet-wide average and 12 percent of them replace hybrid vehicles. This implies that ignoring the non-random replacement of gasoline vehicles would result in overestimating emissions benefits of EVs by 39 percent. Federal income tax credits resulted in a 29 percent increase in EV sales, but 70 percent of the credits were obtained by households that would have bought an EV without the credits. By simulating alternative subsidy designs, we find that a subsidy designed to provide greater incentives to low-income households would have been more cost effective and less regressive.","The diffusion of plug-in hybrid and fully electric vehicles (EVs), coupled with cleaner electricity generation, offers a promising pathway to reduce air pollution from on-road vehicles and to strengthen energy security. In contrast to conventional gasoline vehicles with internal combustion engines, EVs use electricity stored in rechargeable batteries to power the motor. When operated in all-electric mode, EVs consume no gasoline and produce zero tailpipe emissions. But the stored electricity is generated from other sources such as power plants, which produce air pollution. Therefore, the environmental impacts of EVs depend on several critical factors. First, emissions created from operating EVs depend on the fuel source of electricity generation. Second, emissions diverted from EVs depend on the difference in emissions intensity between EVs and the vehicles that EVs replace. Third, some other factors also affect the emission impacts of EVs, such as their effect on total vehicles in operation and the total vehicle miles traveled. While prior literature has focused on the first factor (Archsmith et al., 2015; Holland et al., 2016, 2019), few analyses explore the others factors. In this study, we fill this gap by focusing on the second factor and illustrate the critical role this channel plays in determining the environmental benefits of EVs.==== More specifically, we examine what EV buyers would have purchased had EVs been unavailable. This counterfactual serves as the proper baseline to evaluate the emissions impacts of EV diffusion.====An EV is a vehicle that is capable of running on electricity along at least part of the miles that the vehicle is driven. These vehicles include both plug-in hybrids (e.g. Chevrolet Volt) and fully electric vehicles (e.g. Tesla Model S) but exclude conventional hybrid vehicles (e.g. Toyota Prius). Since the introduction of the first mass-market models into the United States in late 2010, EV sales have grown rapidly to about two percent of the new vehicle market.==== To encourage adoption, the federal government provides a federal income tax credit to new EV buyers based on each vehicle's battery capacity and the gross vehicle weight rating, with the amount ranging from $2500 to $7500. Several states have established additional state-level incentives to further promote EV adoption, including tax exemptions and rebates for EVs and non-monetary incentives such as high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane access, toll reduction, and free parking.====A potential concern associated with subsidy policies is that they may create “non-additional” emissions reductions: some EV buyers would have purchased EVs even if there was no subsidy.==== Since early adopters may place a higher value for new technology and the environment, it is likely that some buyers have received a windfall gain without changing their behavior.====Moreover, even if the tax credits increased EV sales, the emissions impact may be small if EVs replace vehicles with low emissions ratings. The effect that EVs have on emissions depends on how clean EVs are relative to the vehicles they are replacing. Many EV buyers could have bought a low-emission gasoline vehicle had EVs or EV incentives not been available. This could arise from consumer preference heterogeneity and sorting: consumers that value fuel efficiency or environmentally friendly vehicles buy vehicles that are fuel-efficient or deemed environmentally friendly, such as the Toyota Prius or the Toyota Prius Plug-In. For these buyers, opting to buy the EV yields small or even negative emissions benefits.====To understand these issues, we use a stylized model to derive a simple expression relating vehicle substitution patterns – represented by cross-price elasticities of demand – to emissions changes. Our model shows that the greater the substitution a non-EV has with an EV, the greater the impact the vehicle's emissions have on the emissions effect of the EV. We then estimate a random coefficient discrete choice model of vehicle demand by using a rich household survey of US new vehicle buyers and market-level sales data from 2010 to 2014. The estimation takes advantage of the second-choice information from household survey data, which greatly improves the precision of the random coefficient estimates and the resulting substitution patterns. With the model, we simulate counterfactual market outcomes by removing the EVs from the market to examine how consumers substitute between EVs and non-EVs. We then conduct other counterfactual exercises to examine the cost-effectiveness of the income tax credits policy in terms of reducing on-road emissions and compare these results with alternative policy designs.====Our approach builds on the methodology used by Holland et al. (2016) and Holland et al. (2019) to estimate EV replacement vehicles. Their approach assigns a replacement vehicle based on stated preference second choice survey data.==== Instead of using survey data solely to assign a substitute model for each EV, we estimate a vehicle demand model incorporating both aggregate sales data and second choice survey data. The estimated own- and cross-price elasticities can directly reflect the substitution patterns between EVs and vehicles of other fuel types. The recovered consumer preference parameters allow us to run simulations to quantify the difference in emissions between the observed EV sales and the simulated replaced vehicles, as well as the impact of the subsidy programs on increasing EV sales. Our structural approach also allows us to compute how much EV subsidies lead to additional EV purchases, which allows us to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the subsidies.====With our estimated demand model, we run counterfactual simulations, which reveal three key findings. First, electric vehicles appear to be replacing relatively fuel-efficient vehicles, as households that generally prefer EVs also prefer conventional gasoline vehicles with better fuel economy. This implies that calculations of emissions benefits should account for the non-random replacement of conventional gasoline vehicles. Ignoring this non-random replacement overestimates emissions benefits by 27 percent. Second, the availability of and support for EVs has not led to a significant reduction in market share for hybrid vehicles. Hybrids had been supported by the federal government in the 2000s and have seen a decline in market share since 2014, a time when EVs had started to gain significant market share. But our results suggest that EVs have had a limited impact on hybrid sales. Instead, the elimination of the federal subsidy for hybrids has caused a significant reduction in hybrid sales. Third, the cost-effectiveness of the subsidy program is limited by the fact that about 70 percent of consumers would have purchased EVs without the subsidy. We find that this result is sensitive to the price elasticity of demand, where more elastic demand implies a greater number of additional EV purchases. By comparing the current uniform subsidy with an alternative policy design that removes the subsidy for high-income households and provides additional subsidies to low-income households, our analysis shows that better targeting could potentially increase the cost-effectiveness of the subsidy programs in terms of EV demand and environmental benefits. Our simulation results contribute to the literature on the diffusion of low-emission technologies and the cost-effectiveness of subsidy programs promoting these technologies (Allcott et al., 2015; Boomhower and Davis, 2014; Langer and Lemoine, 2018; Sallee, 2011).====Our study adds to the literature on the demand for electric vehicles and the EV market. Li et al. (2017) employ data on EV sales and charging stations at the city level to quantify the interplay between the availability of charging infrastructure and the installed base of EVs. Our structural approach allows us to address several key issues surrounding EV demand that reduced-form methods are unable to quantify, including the identification of vehicles that are being replaced by EVs and the welfare effects of EV policies. Springel (2020) estimates a structural model of consumer vehicle choice and charging station entry in the Norwegian EV market and compares the effectiveness of direct purchasing price subsidies with charging station subsidies. Li (2016) examines the issues of compatibility in charging technology and finds that mandating compatibility in charging standards would increase the sales of EVs. Muehlegger and Rapson (2020) use the EV subsidy receipts data and vehicle transaction prices to estimate the pass-through rate of the EV incentive program in California and find that 80 to 92 percent of the subsidies were passed through to consumers and that a decrease of 10 percent in EV prices increases EV demand by 31–37 percent. In contrast to these papers, our study focuses on identifying the vehicles that EVs replace.====We organize the rest of the paper as follows. Section 2 briefly describes the data used in the empirical analysis. In Section 3, we develop a simple analytical model to show emissions impacts of vehicle substitution depend on key vehicle demand parameters to help guide our empirical analysis. Section 4 presents the empirical model and estimation strategy. Section 5 presents the estimation results of the substitution. In Section 6, we present the counterfactual simulations to evaluate the environmental benefits of the introduction of EVs and the impact of the EV subsidy. We also conduct simulations to examine the impact of EVs on hybrid vehicle sales and whether an income-dependent subsidy design could improve the cost-effectiveness of the subsidy.

Conversely, conservation sites can be placed strategically to block conversion cascades. Lands that support moderate ecological benefits but have strong intensive use potential are desirable conservation targets when these preempt conversion cascades, which is in contrast with the conservation strategies that aim to maximize ecological benefits per unit cost. When network economies exist in land use returns as well as in ecological benefits, a Pigouvian subsidy is shown to favor extensive land cover while a subsidy payment upon preservation of adjacent lands can tilt incentives in favor of either land use. We illustrate our findings with landscape-level simulations calibrated to the U.S. Prairie Pothole Region (PPR). Finally, we estimate grassland conversion hazard by employing satellite imagery to provide statistical evidence for land use network economies in the PPR.","The supply side of the U.S. environmental conservation markets is characterized by private property owners who are willing, usually at a positive price, to accept land use restrictions that foster the provision of public environmental goods. The demand side is less conventional. Demand is often coordinated by conservation managers who use either taxes or donated money to compensate landowners for signing contracts to restrict behavior in ways that support regional environmental amenities (Parker and Thurman 2019). These managers face budget constraints when seeking to elicit environmental benefits arising from externalities that may be intricate in form. Moreover, the conservation agencies may have to produce their own data when devising strategies and incentives to protect lands that generate high ecological benefits per unit cost.====Large, contiguous and compact landmasses are believed to improve the efficacy of conservation programs by generating higher long-term species-richness than those generated from multiple fragmented parcels of the same total area (Diamond 1975; Margules et al., 1988; Williams et al., 2005; van Nouhuys 2009; Johnson et al., 2010; Wimberly et al., 2018). The environmental amenities generated from conservation can induce land market feedbacks that lead to higher land prices and faster development, and reduce the conservation benefits in an area (Armsworth et al., 2006; Polasky 2006; Coisnon et al., 2014; Zipp et al., 2017). The spatial network interactions among ecological benefits ensure that designing cost-effective mechanisms to conserve contiguous private lands remains challenging, especially when alternative land uses such as urbanization and agriculture generate relatively higher returns.====Two prominent policy control mechanisms that aim to establish contiguous ecological reserves are spatial targeting and agglomeration bonus payment. Under spatial targeting strategies conservation managers first identify the total area and location of land parcels for preservation, and then use their limited budget to purchase those parcels. Spatial targeting strategies are employed globally to protect forestlands, coastal lands, and croplands in rural-urban landscapes (Newburn et al., 2006; Moanga et al., 2018; Nolte et al., 2019). Agglomeration bonus, on the other hand, is a ‘smart subsidy’ provided in addition to the baseline conservation contract price. It is intended to encourage spatial coordination among adjacent landowners for protecting contiguous reserves (Parkhurst et al., 2002; Parkhurst and Shogren 2007, 2008; Grout 2009; Bucholtz et al., 2010; Hanley et al., 2012). Agglomeration bonus can generate efficiency gains relative to a spatially homogenous payment in acquiring adjacent lands (Drechsler et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2019). However, the bonus might differ arbitrarily from conservation externalities it seeks to redress and coordination failures may occur even when the bonus is sufficient (Fooks et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2019).====Empirical evidence on the effectiveness of existing conservation policies in establishing contiguous reserves is not encouraging due to property right fragmentations and land acquisition costs.==== Agency staff efforts to increase awareness among locals and gradually shift social norms improve the effectiveness of spatial targeting strategies (Lawley and Yang 2015; Oldekop et al., 2015). Experimental studies support higher spatial coordination when the agglomeration bonus policy facilitates information transfer among local landowners about each other’s choices and payoffs (Banerjee 2017; Banerjee et al., 2017). Laboratory experiments also suggest that spatial targeting can improve contiguity relative to the agglomeration bonus in limited budget environments, and that combining targeting strategies with the bonus can prove to be efficient in establishing contiguous reserves (Fooks et al., 2016).====While the conservation planning literature has focused mainly on augmenting agglomeration effects in ecological benefits (e.g., Duke et al., 2015), recent studies emphasize a more balanced approach by placing greater weight on land acquisition costs and land market feedbacks (Stephens et al., 2008; Walker et al., 2013; Miao et al., 2016; Augustynczik et al., 2018; Panchalingam et al., 2019). Here we investigate how production network economies can impact land acquisition costs and land use decisions, thereby moving beyond parcel-level factors such as soil quality when evaluating a parcel’s suitability for conservation.====Some network economies in agriculture are well-documented, including technology adoption (Cowan and Gunby 1996), crop and livestock production (Roe et al., 2002) and increasing returns to crop cover density (Holmes and Lee 2012). Such increasing returns take the form of lower fixed costs, higher net benefits for newer adopters due to improved learning (Cowan 1991) and reduced uncertainty (Arthur 1989). Network economies in land use can be manifest through spatial dependence in land use returns where higher cropping density leads to the emergence of new infrastructure, markets and services that provide incentives for cropland expansion in the locality (Dorosh et al., 2012; Berg et al., 2018; Kiprono and Matsumoto 2018). Network efficiencies also arise in transportation infrastructure (Bleakley and Lin 2012), where freight costs are a key component of competitiveness in agriculture. See Section S1 in Supplementary Materials (====) for further discussions.====Our study is the first to systematically investigate the role of production network spillovers, as distinct from agglomeration effects in ecological benefits, when designing cost-effective conservation policy. We model land use conversion decisions between an extensive (or biodiversity-friendly) use and an intensive use, e.g., cropping, when land use returns exhibit strategic complementarities. We specify a theoretical model to study permanent grassland conversion decisions for crop production, which lead to irreversible loss of ecological benefits. Although the analysis applies generally, this specification enables us to conduct real-world landscape simulations and provides statistical evidence on the presence of spatial land use network economies (discussed below). While the conservation planning literature has addressed agglomeration effects in ecological benefits, we seek to derive efficient conservation strategies when network economies are present in land use returns and in ecological benefits. We find that strategic conservation site locations can generate network economies that disrupt cropland expansion networks, and that spatial targeting and agglomeration bonus policies can leverage the land use network economies to promote cost-effective conservation.====We then conduct landscape simulations to portray real-world implications of addressing spatial production spillovers in conservation mechanisms. The theoretical model parameters are calibrated with data for the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR), which contains mixed-prairie grasslands and wetlands, and generates a multitude of ecosystem services (Wimberly et al., 2017; Lark et al., 2019). The region also witnessed extensive land use conversions to cropping in recent years (US GAO 2007; Stephens et al., 2008; Claassen et al., 2011; Ando and Mallory 2012; Walker et al., 2013; Lawley and Yang, 2015; Miao et al., 2016; Lark et al., 2015, 2019), which makes it an ideal case study for conservation design problems.====Both theoretical and simulations-based analyses in this paper assume the existence of spatial dependence in land use returns, which is itself a testable hypothesis. To further investigate the underlying premise we provide statistical evidence on the existence of land use network economies in the U.S. PPR of North Dakota (ND) and South Dakota (SD) where many privately-owned grasslands were cultivated after commodity prices rose significantly around 2006. An original characterization of historical grasslands (Arora and Wolter 2018) is combined with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Cropland Data Layers (CDL) to estimate the impact of neighborhood grass density on regional grassland conversion decisions. We conclude with a brief discussion on future research avenues for conservation mechanism design problems.",The impact of production network economies on spatially-contiguous conservation– Theoretical model with evidence from the U.S. Prairie Pothole Region,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069621000255,16 March 2021,2021,Research Article,166.0

The natural capital value may actually be negative for an interval of time, during which it is optimal for society to continue conserving the species by developing a buffer. The results of the analysis are sensitive to key ecological and economic parameters, especially on the benefits side.","Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) grizzly bears (====), which are currently listed as a “threatened” species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), are a high-profile species that pose unique management challenges.==== Grizzly bears are large charismatic mammals at the top of the food chain. They are powerful predators that symbolize wildness and represent the natural history of the American West. Grizzly bears can simultaneously inspire wonder, awe, and terror, and they are capable of causing considerable damage to economic activity (White et al., 2017). The area in which GYE grizzly bears have recovered includes Yellowstone National Park (YNP) and Grand Teton National Park (GTNP), two of the most visited national parks in the United States.==== The region is also home to roughly half a million locals.====On one hand, people clearly value grizzly bears. It has been well documented that people derive benefits from viewing bears, both in-person (Clayton and Mendelsohn, 1993; Miller et al., 1998; Anderson et al., 2010; Skibins et al., 2012; Richardson et al., 2014, 2015a, 2017; Kubo and Shoji, 2016; Keating and Krannich, 2020) and virtually (Loomis et al., 2018; Skibins and Sharp, 2019). National park visitors like seeing bears in particular. Richardson et al. (2014) asked respondents to select the top five animals they would like to see on a trip to YNP. Bears were chosen by the highest percentage of respondents (81%). Anderson et al. (2010) found that grizzly bears were the species of primary interest for most Denali National Park visitors. More specifically, Skibins et al. (2012) found grizzly bears to be the species from the “Big 5” in Denali National Park (grizzly bears, wolves, caribou, Dall sheep, and moose) that had the most influence in terms of predicting wildlife viewing satisfaction. There is also evidence that people obtain nonuse value from the mere existence of grizzly bears (Brookshire et al., 1983; Duffield et al., 2006).====On the other hand, grizzly bears in the GYE pose risks to local economic activity, local individuals, and GYE visitors (White et al., 2017; van Manen et al., 2019). As the grizzly bear population has recovered, there has been an increase in the number of grizzly bear-human conflicts, which include incidents such as livestock depredations, property damages, and human injuries. These conflicts may be eroding public support for conservation (Gunther et al., 2004). When conflicts are severe enough, federal and state agencies may respond by removing offending grizzly bears and risking mortality on the species.==== Grizzly bears are particularly interesting predators, because they incur high rates of human-caused mortality even while being federally protected.====The counterbalancing positive and negative effects of grizzly bears on GYE visitors and locals make them one of a class of “multi-use” wildlife species (Zivin et al., 2000; Rondeau, 2001). There are many examples of multi-use species, including livestock (Huffaker et al., 1989, 1990), wild horses (Huffaker et al., 1990; Fonner and Bohara, 2017), beavers (Huffaker et al., 1992), feral pigs (Zivin et al., 2000), white-tailed deer (Rondeau, 2001; Rondeau and Conrad, 2003), African elephants (Horan and Bulte, 2004), moose (Skonhoft and Olaussen, 2005; Skonhoft, 2006; Olaussen and Skonhoft, 2011), wolves (Skonhoft, 2006), and alewives (Fenichel et al., 2010). The abundance of a multi-use species at a particular point in time determines whether benefits or damages dominate, which makes management complicated (Rondeau, 2001). Whether a multi-use species is considered a natural asset or a liability depends on the sign of their ==== marginal net benefits at certain population sizes (Horan and Bulte, 2004).==== Optimal management typically calls for attaining and maintaining the optimal natural capital value of a species by controlling its population size. Wildlife managers utilize a diverse array of control actions, including trapping (Huffaker et al., 1992; Zivin et al., 2000), hunting (Zivin et al., 2000; Skonhoft and Olaussen, 2005; Skonhoft, 2006; Olaussen and Skonhoft, 2011), culling (Rondeau and Conrad, 2003), stocking (Huffaker et al., 1989, 1990; Rondeau, 2001; Fenichel et al., 2010), and non-lethal controls (Fonner and Bohara, 2017).====A common assumption is that wildlife managers are able to employ any control action in their arsenal, as long as it helps society achieve better outcomes. This assumption does not reflect reality for many species, such as those protected by the ESA. The rub with ESA protections is that they limit the types of control actions managers can use to manage a species. If a protected species is high-profile enough, possible control actions may come under intense scrutiny from the general public. The contentiousness of management programs for certain species can lead to negotiated settlements that offer very little in terms of flexibility. Federal and state wildlife agencies currently indirectly control the grizzly bear population through conflict prevention and response. ESA protections prevent other, more direct, control actions. Nevertheless, active management strategies, such as harvests, have been close to being implemented for GYE grizzly bears. GYE grizzly bears are considered a conservation success story, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) has twice used evidence of recovery to justify removing GYE grizzly bears from the ESA: once in 2007, once in 2017. Both times, ensuing litigation led to grizzly bears being relisted.==== Prior to grizzly bears being relisted in 2018, Wyoming and Idaho had planned to enact limited grizzly bear hunting seasons; the hunts were canceled days before they were scheduled to begin. The constant back and forth has made grizzly bear management a highly-charged and contentious issue that pits multiple stakeholders against each other.====In this paper, a bioeconomic model is constructed, in which a representative wildlife agency maximizes the social net benefits from grizzly bears by deciding whether (and if so, when) to enact an “active” management strategy. Under active management, managers have the flexibility to employ control actions to directly influence the species' population size. To reflect the rigidities faced by agencies in the management of this high-profile species, a linear optimal control model is employed. The agency's decision of whether or not to enact active management is akin to switching from a policy of no-harvests (i.e., “reactive” management through conflict prevention and response) to a policy of harvests. The analysis yields a threshold population size and natural capital value at which the agency should switch from reactive to active management. The optimal strategy balances the interests of multiple stakeholder groups, which has the potential to reduce the contentiousness of grizzly bear management. A key result in the application considered is that it may be optimal for society to continue conserving a species even after its natural capital value turns negative. In such cases, it is optimal for society to develop a buffer of the species by holding more in the wild than might be expected before enacting a new control action. The outcomes under active management are compared to those under the current reactive management strategy. Available data indicates that the grizzly bear population has exceeded the buffer required for a switch to active management. The results are highly sensitive to magnitudes of key ecological and economic parameters, particularly those on the benefits side.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains background information about grizzly bear management in the GYE. Section 3 presents the theoretical bioeconomic model. In Section 4, all functional forms and parameter values are specified using existing data. Section 5 includes the results under the benchmark paramaterization, as well as sensitivity analysis over key parameters.

In some situations, the amount of the resource that is available to allocate may be unknown when parties are competing for shares and perhaps not realized until contestants actually attempt to claim their shares of the resource. For example, fishing quotas may be awarded based on estimated fish populations, but if there are fewer fish than anticipated, those who are last to harvest may not be able to fill their quota. We model contests of this form and test the predictions of the model using a controlled laboratory experiment. The general result, supported by both theory and experimental data, is that participants compete less intensively for shares of the resource when uncertainty regarding the size of the prize is resolved later in the process.","Recently, there has been considerable theoretical and experimental attention on contests, where parties compete for the right to claim a share of a prize (e.g., Dechenaux et al., 2015; Sheremeta, 2011). Applications vary from election campaigns to patent races and brand advertising to lobbying efforts and political processes for awarding natural resources (Boyce, 1998; Fudenberg et al., 1983; Krueger, 1974; Snyder, 1989; Tullock, 1980). The effort and resources dedicated to competing for a share of a prize rather than to productive activities are commonly referred to as rent-seeking behavior (Bhagwati, 1982; Krueger, 1974; Posner, 1975; Tullock, 1967). Such behavior has been shown to occur in many institutional settings and to have large social losses (e.g., Angelopoulos et al., 2009; Cowling and Mueller, 1978; Torvik, 2002).====In the literature, it is typically assumed that the contestants know the value of the prize, or at least that the sum of the potential entitlements equals the available prize (see Sheremeta, 2019). However, there are settings in which this assumption may not hold because the amount of the prize is unobserved and shares to the prize are rewarded sequentially. For example, farmers secure rights to sequentially extract from an irrigation canal (Janssen et al., 2011a; Ostrom and Gardner, 1993). If water flow is less than expected when entitlements were determined, those farmers who extract last may not be able to claim any water. A similar phenomenon can occur in bankruptcy filings, where creditors are prioritized and some may be left unable to recoup losses if the assets turn out to be worth less than anticipated.====In this paper, we study a generalized version of a contest in which players compete for the right to a share of a prize when the size of the prize is uncertain and claims to the prize are filled sequentially. We develop a theoretical model that extends conventional proportional-prize contest models (Cason et al., 2010; Tullock, 1980) and generates a set of testable hypotheses under varying assumptions regarding the timing of when the size of the prize is realized. We test these hypotheses in a laboratory setting with an experimental design that uses the certainty of the prize (known or unknown) and the timing in which the prize is realized as treatments.==== An important distinction between our paper and the previous literature is that we focus on the effect of an exogenously uncertain prize, whereas other papers have considered uncertainty in a different dimension by comparing winner-take-all and proportional prize contests (e.g. Cason et al., 2020, Chowdhury et al., 2014, Masiliūnas, 2020) with a known fixed prize.====Our theory and motivation align with the circumstances of fishermen, who compete for harvest from a stock of unknown size (Laukkanen, 2003; McKelvey and Golubtsov, 2006). Indeed, intense user group competition and a highly variable prize are common features of many fisheries around the world (Hilborn et al., 2005; Huang and Smith, 2014). This is illustrated, perhaps, nowhere better than the salmon fisheries of the Kenai Peninsula in Alaska. There are varied user groups: commercial, sport, and personal-use fishermen. Each group invests significant time and money to compete for fish before and during the season. Pre-season lobbying is important for each user group, particularly sport and commercial, for establishing their share of the total allowable catch. The catch, or the prize, can be significant, but shares of the catch are regulated and depend on nature and the degree of competition with other users. Salmon abundance, particularly Sockeye salmon (a.k.a. Red salmon), is highly variable and difficult to predict (Schoen et al., 2017).====A particular feature of a salmon fishery is that harvesting is sequential due to the spawning habits of the species. Salmon spend their adult lives in the ocean. But on their way to spawn, salmon swim up-river in pulses over a short time period during the summer and early fall; salmon spawn in smaller tributaries and so all fishing is regulated to occur downstream of spawning areas. Different types of users operate in distinct areas, which the fish pass through in a single direction. Competition begins in the salt-water commercial fishery, as salmon converge at the mouth of river systems, and extends upriver where sport and subsistence/personal-use fishing occurs. Downstream and saltwater harvesters typically have a distinct advantage over upstream users, particularly in low-abundance years. In high-abundance years, regulators adjust up allowable catch during the season to avoid “over-escapement” —i.e., too many fish escaping up-river to spawn—and mid-season adjustments often provide heterogeneous benefits.==== As in other lobbying settings, Kenai River watershed users spend a considerable amount of resources trying to influence the State’s Board of Fish and other agencies for favorable treatment. Ongoing declines in the important Chinook salmon (a.k.a. King salmon) fishery has also led to intense lobbying efforts by sport fishermen, who generally attribute the decline to a “bycatch” (i.e., incidental catch of Chinook salmon) problem with the commercial fishery.====While our theory is motivated by the salmon fishery, the experiments are neutrally framed so the implication of our results are more general and can be directly compared with other contest experiments. Similar to other studies, we find that subjects over-spend relative to predicted amounts in all treatments. In symmetric treatments, when subjects invest prior to the prize amount being determined, we find that player order doesn’t matter as lobbying effort doesn’t depend on bidding position as predicted by theory. In asymmetric treatments, when the sequential nature of the claims is such that prize collection order should impact behavior, we find that those whose claims are filled later invest less than those whose claims are filled earlier, consistent with theoretical predictions. Further, uncertainty is found to reduce overall effort, and when potential resources are capped (e.g., a limit on harvests that is less than the available resource), subjects invest less effort on average. Finally, when resources aren’t capped and allocations are awarded before subjects know the amount of the available resource, the total amount of lobbying decreases. Our theoretical and experimental findings therefore suggest that when allocations are rewarded sequentially, rent-seeking behavior could be partially subdued by constraining lobbying effort to occur before the size of the prize is determined or announced.",Contests for shares of an uncertain resource,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069621000127,9 March 2021,2021,Research Article,168.0

The CRP uses a pay-as-bid, reverse auction with field-specific price caps to enroll most of the land in the program. ==== and empirical studies from other domains suggest that the restrictive price-cap auction format used in the current design of the CRP exhibits issues in terms of efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Using a laboratory experiment, we study the impact of varying the tightness of the price-cap auctions. We also examine two alternative auction formats based on reference prices. We find that excessively tight bid caps reduce efficiency and cost effectiveness by discouraging participation. Conversely, bid caps set too high also reduce cost-effectiveness by allowing higher rents. An exogenous reference price ranking format, which makes medium-cost sellers more competitive against low-cost sellers, reduces both efficiency and cost-effectiveness. An endogenous reference price format increases cost-effectiveness by increasing participation and reducing rents.","Reverse auctions are a popular structure for conservation programs that provide payments for ecosystem services. Since these are voluntary programs, achieving cost-effective and efficient outcomes is formidable challenging and depends upon often complex program rules and ranking formats (Claassen et al., 2008).====Among the best known and largest of these programs is the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), administered by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), which pays landowners to convert environmentally sensitive or vulnerable cropland to a perennial cover of grasses or trees for at least 10 years.====Most CRP acres are enrolled through what is known at the General Signup, in which interested landowners submit an offer consisting of the parcel boundary to be enrolled, specific conservation practice to which the cropland will be converted, and a desired annual payment (the bid). Offers are then scored and ranked on the basis of an Environmental Benefits Index (EBI), which weighs the bid against the anticipated environment gain from the conservation practice. After the auction closes, a minimum acceptable cutoff EBI is selected by USDA, based on program acreage constraints and other considerations, and all proposals with an EBI above the cutoff are enrolled.====In addition to the use of an auction, to reduce rents through competitive pressure, the program also constrains rents through the use of field-specific bid caps.==== These estimates of opportunity cost are inherently imprecise and can adversely affect program performance by both driving away potential bidders when they are lower than actual opportunity cost and enabling remaining participants to extract information rents when they are higher (Kirwan et al., 2005; Hellerstein, 2017).====This study follows the literature on using laboratory experiments of simulated auctions to evaluate alternative conservation auction formats (Schilizzi, 2017). While a number of the earlier studies have looked at design considerations such as the revelation of agency preferences for environmental quality (Cason and Gangadharan, 2004; Messer et al., 2017), transaction costs (Palm-Forster et al., 2016), types of program constraints (Boxall et al., 2017), and coordination incentives (Banerjee et al., 2015), only a few conservation studies have looked at the tightness of the bid caps and the formula underlying the cost ranking format (Hellerstein and Higgins, 2010).====In this paper, we look at three main auction formats: bid caps, exogenous reference prices, and endogenous reference prices. In the case of bid caps we study multiple configurations where we vary how “tight” the bid cap is with respect to the parcel-specific opportunity cost estimate. The exogenous reference price is based on the opportunity cost information available to the program and the endogenous reference price on the offers of sellers with similar cost information.====With respect to bid caps, we find that making the cap tighter (i.e., reducing the potential for markups) reduces participation dramatically, even among low-cost sellers, making the caps counterproductive in terms of cost-effectiveness. Conversely, loosening up the bid cap does not increase competition and mainly enables sellers to obtain high rents, hurting cost-effectiveness. There is a cap level that balances the participation effects discussed with the potential for reducing offer values. However, as discussed in Hellerstein and Higgins (2010) (and in our experimental evidence below), striking the right balance is to a large extent unattainable outside controlled experimental settings.====Comparing bid caps to reference prices, we find that participation rates in the exogenous reference price are statistically equal to those of modest and loose bid caps, but higher than in tight bid caps. In contrast, the endogenous reference price auction exhibited a noticeably higher participation rate, enhancing competition.====In terms of cost-effectiveness, the exogenous reference price performance is comparable to a loose bid cap. Interestingly, the endogenous reference price outperforms the exogenous reference price and the tight bid caps. There is also mild evidence that it also outperforms the very relaxed bid caps. While the endogenous reference price auction was not as cost effective as the auction in which bid caps were relaxed just enough so no seller would be dissuaded from entry, we argue such caps are only implementable in an experimental setting.====Our results highlight both how the current design of the CRP auction discourages participation among low cost bidders, hurting efficiency and cost effectiveness, and the advantages of relaxing bid caps or replacing them with reference prices in a program redesign.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides relevant background information on the CRP. Section 3 reviews the related literature on auction design.

In this paper, we examine the effect of local environment regulation outcomes, i.e., local pollution, on leaders’ chances of ","The emerging environmental crisis in China has attracted much attention from practitioners and academics (Economy 2004; Shapiro 2012). Environmental challenges pose considerable threats to China’s long-term development (Tilt 2013). In addition to the detrimental effects on its own environment, Chinese environmental crisis has profound global implications. For instance, with its increasing economic size and energy consumption, China is now the largest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world. In 2018, Chinese emissions of roughly 13.5 Gt CO2 were approximately 25% of the global total (Olivier and Peters, 2018).====The environmental crisis in China is not only a natural outcome of economic growth in a typical developing country going through industrialization. Rather, there are deep political reasons, one of which has to do with the incentive structure for local officials who have long been prioritizing economic development at the expense of the environment. Chinese cadre evaluation system promotes those who deliver high priority targets. Local leaders are motivated to develop local economy because upper-level governments make promotion decisions by evaluating the relative economic growth of jurisdictions (Maskin et al., 2000). To generate better economic growth, local governments often sacrifice the environment by, for instance, lessening or non-compliance with existing regulations to lower local firms’ production costs.====The public and the central government have become acutely aware of such a built-in “environmentally unfriendly” incentive in the cadre evaluation system. The central government has implemented various policies to address severe environmental issues. For instance, in 2013, the State Council approved the ====, which outlines specific PM2.5 air pollution targets for local governments. In recent years, new targets including environmental protection have been added as high priority targets for local officials. The central government expects that such changes would incentivize local officials to reduce pollution.==== However, for many scholars, when it comes to performance evaluation, promoting economic growth is still considered by most local officials as the safest bet for career advancement (Li and Zhou 2005; Heberer and Senz 2011).====This paper tests whether local officials’ green efforts, reflected by better local environmental outcomes, are rewarded by the cadre evaluation system since the early 2000s. This is an important question, because only when the system rewards green behaviors, local officials might move away from their past priority in promoting economic growth, so that the environmental crisis in China might be addressed. We first collect county party secretary data for over 2000 Chinese counties between 2001 and 2014 to measure their promotion patterns. We construct county-year level SO2 and PM2.5 air pollution measures, using fine-grained NASA satellite data. We adopt an instrumental variable approach to deal with potential endogeneity issues of the pollution variables: for both PM 2.5 and SO2, we use ventilation coefficient, i.e., the product of wind speed and mixing layer height, as the instrument. Our empirical analysis shows that for county party secretaries, those who were able to reduce air pollution were much more likely to be promoted. We extend our analysis to county magistrates and find similar results. However, when we further extend our study to prefecture and provincial party secretaries, we do not find any evidence for the pollution-promotion link.====We are not the first to empirically test the connection between pollution and cadre promotion in the Chinese context. A few recent studies have started to tackle this pollution-promotion question. Using data on energy intensity, air pollution treatment spending, and air pollution from 86 major Chinese cities, Zheng et al. (2014) find that better environmental performances are associated with a higher chance of city mayor promotion.==== Chen et al. (2016) show a positive connection between energy productivity and provincial governors’ promotion in 31 provinces. Using data from 100 Chinese cities, Pu and Fu (2018) show that pollution decreases the chances of promotion for city mayors, with the effect varying cross regions and by pollutants. Feng et al. (2018), however, find that environmental performance does not significantly impact political turnovers of municipal party secretaries during 2002–2013. Most recently, Wang and Lei (2020) show that local officials’ efforts towards environmental protection contribute to their political promotion for a panel of prefecture-level party secretaries and governors during 1996–2013.====How is our paper different? Firstly, unlike past studies that either use data from the provincial level or from Chinese prefectural cities, we extend this empirical literature to a lower administrative level. This county-level focus has several advantages. For instance, county-level pollution data is much more fine-grained. In China, prefectures are often very large: e.g., the Daxing’anling Prefecture (46,755 km====) in Heilongjiang, not even a top 20 prefecture by size, is roughly the size of Estonia and is larger than Denmark. There is often significant within-prefecture variation in air pollution. Using prefecture or province pollution averages often washes out pollution hotspots in the data. Moreover, counties are historically the most basic units of administration reached by the central government in China.==== Most day-to-day functions of the government, including environmental protection, ultimately are being implemented by county governments. The county-level bureau of environmental protection is the last layer of the environmental protection branch of the government: there is no office or bureau below the county level. Indeed, the importance of the county economy has become even more pronounced after the tax reform in 1994. After this reform, local governments’ economic growth strategy changed from industrialization based on corporate profits to urbanization based on land finance (Kung et al., 2013). County governments have been granted land transfer rights so that they can promote economic growth through low-cost land transfers for investment, real estate development, and establishing financing platforms for infrastructure construction. More recently, county governments have been continuously given greater importance, a trend that is embodied in a series of reforms such as an “expansion of power to create strong counties” (Kuo Quan Qiang Xian) and “provincial directly managed counties” (Sheng Zhi Guan Xian).====Secondly, we use the same instrumental variable strategy to explain promotion of county magistrates and prefecture and provincial party secretaries. We find a similar causal effect of pollution on promotion for county magistrates. But there is no evidence for the pollution-promotion link at the prefecture and provincial levels. This is a significant contribution as it reveals that for party secretaries – those who are in real charge at every level of the government, the causal effect of pollution on promotion only works at the county level. Analyzing promotion of provincial, prefectural, and county party secretaries and government executives between 1999 and 2007, Landry et al. (2018) also only find evidence for performance-based promotion at the county level. Their performance measure is economic growth; our performance measure is based on pollution; both reflect local leaders’ competence, which is often contrasted with loyalty as two competing forces for promotion.==== Why the performance-based promotion only works at the county level? We share a similar explanation as in Landry et al. (2018): local officials who are distant in hierarchy from central rulers have no direct influence on central leader selection, therefore posing little threat even if they are not loyal; they are therefore evaluated based on competence as central leaders need to incentivize them for economic growth and pollution reduction. Higher ranked officials, on the other hand, are within the selectorate that is key to the survival of the central rulers: their loyalty matters much more than competence.====Thirdly, unlike past studies that test statistical associations between pollution and promotion, we adopt an instrumental variable estimation that enables us to make a causal claim. We use ventilation coefficient as the instrument for PM2.5 and SO2. Ventilation coefficient is the product of wind speed and mixing layer height, with the former determining horizontal dispersion of pollution while the latter the height within which pollutants disperse. The higher the wind speed and the mixing height, the faster the dispersion of pollutants, therefore the lower the level of air pollution (Arya 1998). Our instrumental variable approach also helps to address a reverse causality concern that high promotability leaders were assigned to jurisdictions with a better potential in pollution reduction. For instance, local ventilation coefficients often exhibit significant year-by-year changes. Such temporal changes are a function of meteorological conditions that are often difficult to predict for the medium and long terms. It is unlikely that leaders self-select or are appointed in and out of counties depending on (often poorly predicted) expected year-to-year changes in local ventilation coefficients.====Finally, our paper makes general contributions to the literature on environmental outcomes in developing countries and to the literature on the political foundations of pollution. One of the most fundamental questions for environmental and developmental economics is to explain environmental outcomes in developing countries, i.e., “why environmental quality is so poor in developing countries?”==== Greenstone and Jack (2015) synthesize four potential explanations: low marginal willingness to pay for environmental goods, high marginal costs of investments in environmental quality improvements, political economy of rent-seeking behaviors, and market failures (e.g., under-provisions of public goods and negative externalities) and imperfections (e.g., missing land, capital, and labor markets). Our paper speaks directly to the third explanation which often focuses on the role of incentive structure. Firms respond to the incentive structure set up by regulators (McRae 2015). So do government officials. Recent studies present new evidence that improving incentives can improve monitoring and enforcement outcomes. For instance, experimental evidence from Duflo et al. (2013) shows that altering market structure incentivized accurate reporting by third-party auditors in India. In Kahn et al. (2015), interjurisdictional water pollution was reduced significantly in China after a new local cadre promotion rule was established to reward pollution reductions along administrative boundaries. Our paper contributes to this emergent literature at the intersection of developmental and environmental economics by focusing on one of the most important incentive structure changes – a shift away from a growth-at-all-cost incentive structure to one that (also) emphasizes environmental protection – in the largest developing country in the world, China.====In addition, there is a literature in economics and political science that study the political foundations of pollution. The focus here is whether and how political regime types affect environmental performances. The literature often contrasts democracies with autocracies. Overwhelming theoretical propositions favor the former as the better system. For instance, democracy is said to be associated with more citizen influence on policies through the ballot box, pressure groups, and a free media (Payne 1995). However, no clear pattern has emerged from the empirical studies (Grafton and Knowles 2004; Binder and Neumayer 2005; Fredriksson et al., 2005; Bernauer and Koubi, 2009). Such mixed empirical findings have motivated the field to move beyond a simple democracy-autocracy dichotomy and to focus on detailed causal mechanisms connecting political dynamics to environmental outcomes. For instance, recent studies examined variations within democracies regarding institutional differences such as proportional vs. majoritarian electoral rules and presidentialism vs. parliamentarianism (Fredriksson and Millimet 2004). Our paper contributes to this much more nuanced view of political regimes’ environmental impacts. We show that even in the absence of electoral competition, an incentive structure that rewards better environmental performances can be established so that local officials who are able to reduce pollution are more likely to be promoted. This top-down approach serves as a substitutive institution to reward green local leaders, therefore increasing environmental quality in countries without an established democratic rule.",Greening the career incentive structure for local officials in China: Does less pollution increase the chances of promotion for Chinese local leaders?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069621000231,8 March 2021,2021,Research Article,170.0

A growing literature suggests that exposure to pollution can cause respiratory illness and increase deaths among the elderly. However, little is known about whether increases in pollution could cause additional or more severe infections from COVID-19, which typically manifests as a respiratory infection. During the pandemic, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rolled back enforcement of environmental regulation, causing an increase in pollution in counties with more TRI sites. We use the variation in pollution and a ==== design to estimate the effects of increased pollution on county-level COVID-19 deaths and cases. We find that counties with more Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) sites saw a 11.8 percent increase in pollution on average following the EPA’s rollback of enforcement, compared to counties with fewer TRI sites. We also find that these policy-induced increases in pollution are associated with a 53 percent increase in cases and a 10.6 percent increase in deaths from COVID-19.","The SARS-COV-2 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has spread throughout the United States at an alarming rate, represents a serious threat to public health and well-being. It is critically important to discover the factors that cause more cases and deaths from COVID-19, as well as why outcomes vary from place to place. COVID-19 commonly manifests as a respiratory infection, and in severe cases, there is progressive respiratory failure leading to death (====). While a growing body of literature suggests that exposure to pollution can increase mortality and cause people to get sick with a respiratory illness (====; ====; ====; ====; ====), little is known about the factors influencing how the COVID-19 virus spreads or whether pollution might be a factor in increasing the spread of the virus or deaths from COVID-19.====There are two main reasons that pollution could affect COVID-19 outcomes. First, pollution could increase the transmission rate for COVID-19 because pollution harms the immune system, leaving people more vulnerable to airborne diseases (====; ====). Second, pollution could cause existing cases of COVID-19 to become worse because pollution might harm the immune system of infected people. For example, there is evidence that pollution can increase inflammatory cytokines, which have been implicated in deaths from COVID-19 infections due to “cytokine storms” (====).====Nevertheless, on March 26, 2020, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a freeze in civil enforcement of environmental regulations due to the coronavirus pandemic. In particular, the EPA stated that it does “not expect to seek penalties for violations of routine compliance monitoring, integrity testing, sampling, laboratory analysis, training, and reporting or certification obligations in situations where the EPA agrees that COVID-19 was the cause of the noncompliance” (====). However, it is unclear how the EPA will enforce environmental laws without the required reporting.====Most of the facilities impacted by this rollback are likely to be required to report their emissions on the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI), a database maintained by the EPA on industrial or federal facilities that release toxic chemicals such as those commonly found in pollution from factories, power plants, mining, recycling and waste treatment, and other facilities. Most TRI sites (72% in 2018) primarily emit air pollution and usually release a variety of pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, lead, and ozone. This allows us to track which US counties were most likely to see an increase in air pollution after the new policy was announced. TRI sites are common: there are currently about 21,800 TRI sites operating across the United States and more than 221.5 million people (i.e., 2/3 of the U.S. population) had a TRI site operating in their zip code in 2016.==== TRI sites also release billions of pounds of toxic chemicals into the air, land, and water annually (====).====We use EPA data on pollution sites to sort counties into two groups: those who are in the top third in terms of the total number of TRI sites operating in the county and those who are in the bottom two thirds. The top third of counties have 6 or more TRI sites with at least one that releases air pollution. To address the possible selection of TRI sites into counties, we limit our main sample to counties that have at least one TRI site emitting air pollution, so the comparison group includes counties with 1–5 TRI sites. First, we use daily air quality measures from the EPA and a ==== design to show that counties with more TRI sites experienced higher pollution after the rollback. Using the timing of these changes in short-term pollution exposure by county and data on COVID-19 cases and deaths from Johns Hopkins University, we then employ a difference in differences design to estimate whether counties with more TRI sites experienced increases in COVID-19 deaths and cases as a result of the pollution increase, compared to counties that had fewer TRI sites. We control for a variety of social distancing measures, stay at home orders, re-openings, days since the first COVID-19 death, total tests administered, weather, day of the week, cumulative confirmed cases (in the specification on deaths), and county, day of the week, and month fixed effects. To ensure that our results do not simply reflect factors such as population density our main specification limits the sample to counties without a COVID-19 death in the period before the rollback and limits the control group to counties population density of 250 persons per mile or more. We also estimate the effects of the number of TRI sites on cases and deaths nonparametrically, showing that counties with more TRI sites have higher mortality rates from COVID-19.====This paper makes three important contributions. First, this is the first paper to document that in the response to the rollback of environmental enforcement, counties with more TRI sites saw increases in pollution. We find that there is a large, sustained, and statistically significant increase in air pollution after the rollback of environmental regulations in counties with more TRI sites. On average, counties with 6 or more TRI sites experience about 11.8% (i.e., 0.778 μg/m====) higher Particulate Matter2.5 (PM2.5) pollution after the rollback and a 5% increase in ozone, relative to counties in the bottom two thirds of the TRI distribution. This suggests that firms respond in the absence of regulatory incentives to increase pollution.====Second, we find that increases in pollution resulting from the rollback of EPA enforcement led to large and statistically significant increases in COVID-19 cases and deaths. Counties with 6 or more TRI sites experienced a 10.6 percent increase in daily COVID-19 deaths and a 53.0 percent increase in daily confirmed COVID-19 cases after the rollback, compared to counties with 1–5 TRI sites. In addition, we find that increased pollution exposure is worse for counties with a higher fraction of Black individuals. This suggests that the rollback is associated with large, heretofore unmeasured social costs. These results are robust to using weekly (rather than daily) cases and deaths, and a variety of alternative comparison groups and specifications. Finally, this is the first paper to find that exposure to pollution worsens cases and deaths during a pandemic.====Evidence of the extent to which air pollution affects cases and mortality from COVID-19 is important for three reasons. First, any changes in ==== should be informed by the costs associated with those changes, and the costs of deregulation right now could easily outweigh the benefits. Second, it informs our understanding of how pollution affects the transmission of viruses and the death toll during the COVID-19 pandemic, which could inform the creation of live-saving interventions. For example, air purifiers could be employed in in-patient facilities that treat COVID patients on particularly high air pollution days. Third, tangentially related interventions like stay-at-home orders could be modified to maximize the potential reduction in pollution.====The following is the Supplementary data to this article:",The effects of increased pollution on COVID-19 cases and deaths,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069621000140,22 February 2021,2021,Research Article,171.0

Standard U.S. government practice for cost–benefit analysis is to bound such analysis using two alternative rates. These rates are meant to represent the rate of return paid by capital investment and the rate received by consumers. Previous work has shown this approach legitimately bounds the analysis—but only when future benefits accrue directly to consumers either in a two-period model or as a perpetuity. We generalize to consider arbitrary patterns of future benefits, accruing either directly to consumers or indirectly through future investment. We derive an expression for the appropriate discount rate and show that it converges to the consumption rate for benefits increasingly far into the future. More generally, the bounding rates depend on the temporal pattern of the undiscounted dollars. As an application, we estimate the appropriate discount rate for climate change damages from carbon dioxide, finding it lies in a narrow range ( ±0.5 percent) around the consumer rate of interest.","Conducting cost–benefit analysis (CBA) for government policy requires a discount rate to compare costs and benefits over time in order to establish, on net, whether total benefits exceed total costs. For more than 15 years, federal guidelines for government CBA in the United States have indicated that two discount rates should be used, 7 and 3 percent (OMB 2003). When applied to government policies with costs today and benefits extending far into the future—our stylized arrangement throughout this paper====—the different outcomes associated with these rates can be striking. Recent government estimates of climate change benefits, for example, are six to nine times higher using 3 percent rather than 7 percent.====The explicit rationale for this range of rates is based on whether the costs of regulation today fall primarily on the allocation of private capital or instead directly affect household consumption. These rates reflect the pretax return paid by private capital and the return received by consumers, respectively, with the difference owing largely to taxes.==== For shorthand and consistency, we refer to these two rates as the “investment rate” and “consumer rate.” Ignoring risk and uncertainty, CBA using these rates provides upper and lower bounds on the estimate of net benefits when benefits accrue directly to consumers under two alternative, specific assumptions: either the economy exists in only two periods (Harberger 1972; Sandmo and Drèze 1971) or the pattern of benefits over time is a perpetuity (Marglin 1963a, 1963b; Drèze 1974; Sjaastad and Wisecarver 1977).====The main point of this paper is to derive more general bounds on the discount rate in a multi-period model when benefits are no longer assumed to accrue directly to consumers or to be a perpetuity. In particular, we show that these bounds converge to the consumer interest rate when valuing benefits far into the future. Intuitively, the appropriate discount rate is exactly the consumption rate when all costs and benefits accrue to consumption. Impacts on investment ==== (1) have to be converted to consumption equivalents using a shadow price ====, equivalently, (2) must be accommodated by a different discount rate. However, the effect of shadow pricing is at most a bounded multiplicative factor. Mechanically, the appropriate discount rate under approach (2) can be defined as an upward or downward adjustment to the consumption rate based on this bounded multiplicative factor. Looking far into the future, smaller and smaller adjustments to the consumer rate will be needed to compensate for that factor. More generally, this range depends on the pattern of future benefits over time and the shadow price of capital.====We can use the U.S. government’s values of 7 and 3 percent for the investment and consumption rates to provide numeric examples.==== Applied to the pattern of climate mitigation benefits arising in a recent National Academy of Science report (NAS 2017), the appropriate range is quite narrow. The estimated discount rate would be between 2.3 and 4.0 percent if we use the government rates to derive a bound on the shadow price. Adding additional assumptions based on a Ramsey growth model but still calibrated to the government’s 3 percent consumption rate, we can derive a particular shadow price of capital and an even narrower range of 2.7–3.4 percent for the discount rate. On the other hand, the discount rate for a policy with benefits entirely in the very near term could vary from −50 to +50 percent depending on the distribution of impacts on capital versus consumption goods.====At a practical level, our results provide an argument for focusing the discussion of the social discount rate==== on an interval centered on the consumer discount rate and based on each application’s particular pattern of benefits, particularly over long horizons. This need not require any more information than the current government CBA, with selected investment and consumer rates implying a bound on the shadow price.====Our motivation and application are based on discounting guidelines in the United States. However, our results are applicable to jurisdictions with similar approaches, including Canada, where discounting guidelines also focus on alternate investment and consumption rates. Jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom and France have tended to focus on an ethical approach already grounded in a consumption perspective. Our analysis suggests they might want to consider a range of discount rates to the extent there are tax distortions on savings decisions.====Our focus on a policy’s potential impact on investment or consumption is distinct from the question of which consumption or investment rate is appropriate. A recent government white paper, for example, attempted to distill recent evidence regarding both rates, arguing that the current consumer rate might be lower than three percent (CEA 2017). Another paper recently surveyed experts and arrived at a similar conclusion (Drupp et al., 2018). The Interagency Working Group suggested considering 2.5, 3, and 5 percent as a consumption rate, and also pointed out the need to adjust the discount rate for different levels of economic growth (IWG 2010). Meanwhile, Harberger and Jenkins (2015) revisited the empirical estimates for opportunity costs of capital and suggests an upward adjustment to the investment rate.====Another important question is how uncertainty about future benefits might be correlated with market returns or consumption growth. There is a long history in the finance literature that relates this correlation to an appropriate rate of return (e.g., Fama 1977). This thinking has also been applied to public policy, particularly climate change (Gollier 2013).====Regardless of these concerns, however, an analysis must still contend with taxes that create a distortion between the return paid on investment and the returns received by households, regardless of the true consumption and correlation with benefits. This distortion creates a divergence between the shadow price of a dollar of investment and a dollar of consumption. A full welfare analysis under uncertainty must contend with the potential for policy impacts on both consumption and investment ==== everything else about discount rates. In order to focus our discussion, this paper only considers different impacts on consumption and investment, assuming the returns themselves are known.====We are not the first to suggest that the consumer rate is a more appropriate discount rate over long horizons, but we believe we are the first to provide particularly compelling arguments against the investment rate. OMB guidelines note that policies with intergenerational effects raise certain ethical concerns. They suggest that policies with such effects might consider a lower, but positive, rate as a sensitivity analysis ==== calculations based on 3 and 7 percent. They do not suggest that the investment interest rate is incorrect. Government estimates of the social cost of carbon dioxide (SC–CO2) under the Obama administration were based only on consumption interest rates. The underlying analysis (IWG 2010) concluded the consumer rate was appropriate based on the “economics literature”, but it is hard to find such a clear declaration in the noted references. The NAS report argues against an investment interest rate because such a rate is correct only under very restrictive assumptions (NAS 2017). While this is true, the same could be said about the consumption interest rate so long as taxes create a wedge between consumer and investment rates and the impacts on capital and consumption are unclear.====For those concerned about CBA’s application to regulating persistent environmental pollution, including carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, it is hard to overstate the importance of these questions about the appropriate discount rate. On October 16, 2017, the Trump administration issued a CBA of the Clean Power Plan to support the plan’s repeal (U.S. EPA 2017). In contrast to the Obama administration’s CBA, which used a central benefit estimate based on a three-percent discount rate (U.S. EPA 2015), the new CBA of the same regulation gave equal weight to estimates based on three and seven percent. As noted earlier and described in more detail in Appendix A, climate benefits are six to nine times higher using three rather than seven percent. By focusing on the midpoint of benefit estimates based on 3 and 7 percent, the new central benefit estimate is brought down by more than 40 percent. Whether to use the investment rate has thus emerged as a particularly salient discounting policy question.====Our paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we review the literature supporting the use of consumer and investment rates as bounding values for the social discount rate, including Marglin (1963a, 1963b), Harberger (1972), and Sjaastad and Wisecarver (1977). We also review the sharply different results obtained by Bradford (1975) when the assumptions underlying that result are relaxed. As we review these early papers, we develop a simple model to formalize ideas and define the range of social discount rates appropriate for an arbitrary pattern of benefits. We use this model to examine long-run behavior, where we show that the range of discount rates for benefits in the distant future converges to the consumption rate of interest. More generally, the range of appropriate rates depends on the temporal pattern of benefits being valued. The other key parameter that defines this range is the shadow price of capital, which we explore in more detail in section 4. We show that the ratio of investment and consumer rates is an upper bound on the shadow price under relatively weak assumptions. Based on the U.S. government rates, this would be 7/3 (====). Using a Ramsey model calibrated to the 3 percent U.S. consumption rate, along with additional assumptions about depreciation, the output-capital elasticity, and growth, we derive a shadow price of capital of roughly 1.44. This implies that the range of the social discount rate for benefits several decades in the future will have already converged to roughly the consumer rate. Finally, we turn to the climate change application. Using the temporal pattern of climate change damages used in the noted NAS report (2017), we show that the appropriate rate for discounting climate damages lies between 2.7 and 3.4 percent based on a consumer rate of 3 percent and a shadow price of 1.44. Using this range, we find that estimates for the social cost of CO==== differ by a factor of two. This is considerably less than estimates using 3 and 7 percent rates, where the SC-CO2 varies by at least a factor of eight. This section also discusses the sensitivity of these results to a number of assumptions as well as application to other countries.",Use of the consumption discount rate for public policy over the distant future,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069621000115,17 February 2021,2021,Research Article,173.0

Import restrictions on eco-certified goods limit the trade of goods to the home country, but also serve to segment global demand into separate regions for conventional goods and certified goods, altering market structure and equilibrium prices in a manner that can work against sustainability goals. In this paper, we examine the effect of recent import restrictions in the US, EU, Canada, and Japan that require tropical timber products produced in Central Africa to be eco-certified. Using panel data of timber production in Cameroon from 2003 to 2009, we show that conventional timber producers substantially increase harvest rates in response to eco-certification standards. Our findings suggest that import restrictions on tropical timber products shifted production to forests with higher extraction costs, exacerbating economic inefficiency and potentially raising marginal damages from timber extraction.","Import restrictions that require eco-certification as a condition for trade are increasingly used by industrialized countries to address environmental concerns from the unsustainable use of natural resources in developing countries. Import restrictions currently prevent consumers from purchasing foreign goods derived from endangered species, harvested though unsustainable practices (Asner et al., 2009; Crane and Lidgard 1989), and produced using genetically-modified organisms.==== One reason import restrictions have proliferated as a method to influence environmental allocations is that few alternatives exist for industrialized countries to compel producers in developing countries to sustainably harvest globally important natural resources such as tropical forests.====Yet, import restrictions are a blunt instrument for changing production techniques in exporting countries. Producers in developing counties are free to choose whether or not to meet the eco-certification standards of industrialized countries, and can continue to sell goods derived through unsustainable practices in the remaining, non-restricted global markets. The ability to sell unsustainable products elsewhere in the marketplace has the effect of segmenting global demand, providing producers with a tool to differentiate their products that can lead to increased exports from resource-extractive industries by raising prices for certified products and softening price competition in both certified and uncertified markets.====In this paper, we examine the effect of import restrictions in the US, EU, Canada, and Japan that require tropical timber products produced in Central Africa to be eco-certified. Our analysis bridges between the environmental economics literature on eco-certification and the literature on international trade of resource-extractive goods. Within the trade literature, Rodrigue and Soumonni (2014) consider a structural model of interactions between investment in forest certification and current and future export demand and find that, while trade liberalization can increase environmental investment, complementarities that arise between export demand and investment can exacerbate deforestation rates.====Within the environmental economics literature, Mattoo and Singh (1994) were among the first to note that eco-certification can increase global market demand for natural resource-extractive goods when consumers of green products have higher willingness-to-pay for certified products. Sedjo and Swallow (2002) examine eco-certification outcomes in a competitive, partial equilibrium model and demonstrate that producers of uncertified products can increase their output levels as certified firms exit the conventional market, reducing supply and raising equilibrium prices for uncertified products. Our analysis builds on this work by theoretically characterizing and empirically identifying the demand and competition effects described in these studies for the case of import restrictions on tropical timber products.====Much of the eco-certification literature to date relies on quality-based, vertical differentiation models, in which heterogeneous consumers derive utility from an environmental attribute (e.g., sustainability) attached to an underlying functional product (e.g., wood). The environmental attribute, itself, is a credence quality that is indistinguishable in consumption, and eco-certification emerges in equilibrium to validate the presence of the attribute in products, resulting in a price premium for certified goods over conventional goods in the market (Chen, 2001; Amacher et al., 2004). The vertical differentiation model has contributed to our understanding of how premium prices are generated by eco-certification standards and how standards emerge in equilibrium as a result of competition among independent and industry labels (Fischer and Lyon, 2014; Li and van't Veld, 2015; Heyes and Martin, 2016; Fischer and Lyon, 2019; Heyes et al., 2020).====An implicit assumption in vertical differentiation models is that equilibrium prices in each market are determined by consumer substitution on the margin between certified and uncertified products. This logic does not apply to import restrictions, as import restrictions legally prevent consumers residing in countries that implement them from substituting to products that do not meet the import requirement.====Our analysis departs from the eco-certification literature using vertical differentiation models to focus on how import restrictions segment global demand by horizontally differentiating the global marketplace into separate markets for certified and uncertified goods. The key feature of our model is that the products produced in the resource-extractive sector are horizontally differentiated, for instance there are over 70 different tree species harvested in Cameroon, and imposing an import restriction furthers differentiates the marketplace by bifurcating global demand. Formally modeling this element of an import restriction allows us to consider the effect of eco-certification on equilibrium prices and production incentives for firms in exporting regions that can choose whether or not to certify their goods.====We frame our analysis around a model of monopolistic competition in which firms differ according to their marginal costs of production. The import restriction serves to segment global market demand into two, independent populations of consumers according to whether they reside in a country that imposes the eco-certification standard as a condition for trade. In this setting, we formalize three channels of market effects that determine output changes in response to eco-certification. First, eco-labeling provides producers with the means to differentiate their products, thereby relaxing price competition and increasing industry profits in the sense of Shaked and Sutton (1982). The resulting ==== raises global prices and provides individual producers with an incentive to increase output. Second, introducing an eco-label segments global market demand into separate markets for certified and uncertified products, creating a ==== that alters output incentives. Finally, the certification decision by producers truncates the cost distribution of firms serving each market, allowing high-cost producers to profitably sell output in the certified market that would otherwise not be profitable to sell at all. This ==== increases output incentives for firms switching into the certified market, while decreasing output incentives for firms that remain in the uncertified market. An essential contribution of our analysis is that it builds on the work of Sedjo and Swallow (2002) by identifying a novel selection effect that emerges when suppliers have heterogeneous production costs.====We empirically test the predictions of our model using firm-level data that exploits quasi-random variation in the timing of import restrictions on timber producers in Cameroon over the period 2003–2009. Our empirical methodology exploits ecological variation in the geographic ranges of different timber species as well as intertemporal variation in the timing of import restrictions across species. Our findings indicate that high cost producers significantly increase production in response to import restrictions on eco-certified wood. This finding points to the inefficiency of using import restrictions to meet global sustainability goals, both because shifting production towards high cost producers is economically inefficient and because forested regions with high extraction costs often represent areas with high biodiversity benefits (Doremus 2020). Increased production among conventional producers as a result of eco-certification standards can accelerate the loss of primary forests in tropical countries, an area that remains a significant obstacle to global biodiversity conservation (Gibson et al., 2011).,====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In the next section, we provide background detail on the use of import restrictions to prohibit consumers from buying tropical forest products harvested through unsustainable practices. In Section 3, we present a theoretical model to explain how production incentives change in resource-extractive industries in response to import restrictions that segment global market demand into a certified and a non-certified market. In Section 4, we present our empirical analysis on the effect of global eco-certification programs on forest outcomes in Cameroon, and in Section 5, we discuss the policy implications of our findings.",Import restrictions by eco-certification: Quantity effects on tropical timber production,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069621000061,11 February 2021,2021,Research Article,174.0

An intertemporal model of Dutch disease indicates that if the tradable sector is politically dominant then an oil discovery can induce protectionism. If the economy is also credit constrained, this effect is intensified upon discovery, but partially reversed when oil revenues start to flow. We test these predictions using 16.2 million, HS-6 level, bilateral tariff rates that cover 5718 products in 155 countries over the period 1988–2012, and data on worldwide discoveries of giant oil and gas fields. Our identification strategy rests on the exogeneity of the timing of discoveries. Our empirical results indicate that an oil discovery increases tariffs during pre-production years and decreases tariffs in the years to follow yet to a lesser extent, most notably in capital scarce economies with a relatively dominant tradable sector. Our baseline estimates indicate that a giant oil field discovery induces a rise of approximately 13% in the average tariff over the course of 10 years; this increase is approximately 2.5 times larger during the pre-production period when the oil discovery represents a pure news shock.","Understanding the determinants of protectionism has been a long-standing interest of economists and policy makers.==== Recently, populist politicians in various countries have called for a reduction in the level of globalisation. The desire to raise protectionism in periods of negative or slow growth is not new. Since the last global financial crises, it has even manifested itself in economies that historically have strongly endorsed free trade.==== While a range of determinants for protectionism, varying from workers affected by globalisation to protection lobbies, has been put forward, the potential role of oil discoveries has received relatively little attention. This is surprising because the anticipation and wealth effects induced by major oil discoveries have significant impacts on the tradable sectors of small open economies.==== Our aim is to explore the role of oil discoveries in inducing protectionism. We provide theoretical foundations and empirical evidence for the impact of oil discoveries on the level of tariffs, illustrating that such discoveries can lead to economically significant higher levels of protectionism. Furthermore, we show that these effects depend on the extent of financial constraints, dominance of the tradable sector, and whether the policy decision is made before or after the discovery entered its production phase.====The latter point provides further motivation for our work. Following the seminal ideas in Pigou (1927) and Keynes (1936), the literature has explored how expectations and news shocks about possible future events are important in the decisions made by forward-looking agents and how they affect macroeconomic outcomes.==== Although attention has focused on quantification of the effects of news shocks on the consumption and investment decisions made by private agents and their effect on macroeconomic outcomes, less attention has been devoted to the impact of news shocks on the design of policy.==== Notably, private and public agents’ behaviours are not driven by the same goals (e.g. Pritchett, 2000; Besley and Burgess, 2002). Hence, the response of the latter to news shocks should be studied separately. We address this shortcoming by focusing on the role of oil discoveries in determining tariff policies. This allows us to distinguish between the impact before and after production has started. The anticipation effects induced in the former period, as noted by Arezki et al. (2017), can be considered as pure news shocks. Exploiting this feature, we find that news shocks associated with oil discoveries have an important role in inducing the temporal pattern of protectionist policies.====Our analysis focuses on tariffs. As Ludema et al. (2010) and Furceri et al. (2018), among others, argue, tariffs are a good variable for studying trade policy. First, tariffs are the preferred protectionist instrument for many governments and are easy to measure. Second, they are often changed and modified, even in countries that are members of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). This, in turn, gives the necessary variability for identification purposes. In the United States, for example, Congress regularly passes Miscellaneous Tariff Bills, each containing hundreds of changes to the harmonised tariff schedule. Third, tariff changes represent discretionary policies that are much less internationally constrained than other trade policies. The only rule for WTO members is that they do not raise their tariffs above their bound rates.====We start by providing foundations for the effect of oil discoveries on tariff formation. We present a two-period model of Dutch disease in which the government can borrow from the rest of the world and tariffs are endogenously determined. If access to global capital markets is imperfect, a premium on foreign debt must be paid. The government welfare function is a weighted sum of the utilities obtained by the three different groups in society (cf. Long and Vousden, 1991). Each of these three groups owns a different input: tradable-sector-specific capital, non-tradable-sector-specific capital, and labour. We show the impact of an unanticipated oil discovery on tariffs, before and after oil extraction starts, and under different credit conditions. Before the oil-extraction stage, the oil discovery constitutes a pure news shock. We show that if the government objective function attaches equal utility weights to capital owners in each sector and to wage earners (in which case the government maximises aggregate Hicksian consumption) zero tariffs are the optimal outcome. But, if the government wants to protect the interests of capital owners in the traded industry against the adverse effects of Dutch disease, it chooses to impose a positive tariff even ahead of the windfall, upon news of the oil discovery, and to smooth consumption and the tariff via judicious debt management over time. If, in addition, the economy is credit constrained and debt management is hampered, the government puts up a higher tariff in the announcement period than during the windfall period and partially lowers the tariff once oil production starts.====We econometrically test these predictions using detailed bilateral tariff data. The sample includes 16.2 million HS-6 level tariff rates that cover 5718 products in 155 countries over the period 1988–2012. As a measure of the wealth windfall, we employ worldwide discoveries of giant oil and gas fields. Our identification strategy plausibly assumes that the timing of discoveries is exogenous. The unique feature of these data enables us to distinguish between pre- and post-production periods. Using the methodology proposed by Arezki et al. (2017), we find empirically that an oil discovery increases tariffs during pre-production years and decreases tariffs in the years to follow but to a lesser extent, most notably in capital scarce economies with a relatively dominant tradable sector. This suggests that news about oil discoveries increase protectionism. We perform several robustness exercises and find that these results are remarkably robust. They are also quantitatively large: our baseline estimates indicate that a giant oil field discovery induces an increase of approximately 13% (1.4 percentage points) in the average tariff over the course of 10 years, and almost 2.5 times this amount during the pre-production period. Specifically, during the pre-production period the average tariff increases by about 34% (3.75 percentage points), while during the post-production period it decreases by about 21% (2.35 percentage points).====The paper contributes to several additional strands of literature. First, we develop novel political economy implications of the Dutch disease. Corden and Neary (1982) highlighted the potential negative impact of a natural resource discovery on the tradable industries due to appreciation of the real exchange rate. Recent empirical studies indicate that the various aspects of this mechanism gain support in cross-country data (e.g. Arezki et al., 2017; Harding et al., 2020). While the use of tariffs to ameliorate Dutch disease effects has been noted before, to our best knowledge there has not been any attempt to study empirically its mechanisms, direction and magnitude.==== Our aim is to fill this gap and show that it is optimal to react to an oil discovery by raising tariffs, especially during the period after the discovery but before oil production has started. Furthermore, our results show that in capital-constrained economies tariffs help to compensate the lack of effective debt management to smooth consumption.====Second, we contribute to the literature on the political economy determinants of tariff policy.==== Since Adam Smith (1776), most orthodox economists support free trade as the preferred scenario. According to this view, many of the observed barriers to international trade are the result of policymakers that do not maximise social welfare. One explanation is that protectionism is due to vested interests in the political marketplace (e.g. Grossman and Helpman, 1994). Notably, this literature has largely focused on explaining why protectionism rises during bad periods, in contrast to recent occurrences (e.g. Trump, 2017).==== Our contribution is twofold. First, we study the role of an additional determinant (while accounting for the key tariff determinants noted in previous related studies (e.g., Lake and Linask, 2017)), i.e. the news effects of oil discoveries. Second, we provide new insights concerning the desire to raise the extent of protectionism during good periods.====The latter point relates to an additional strand of literature on the association between tariffs and the business cycle. Lake and Linask (2017) give evidence that tariffs are procyclical if they are motivated by terms of trade effects. They argue that economic expansions may lead to a stronger power of importers on product markets, and then, under the terms of trade hypothesis (e.g. Nicita et al., 2018; Ludema and Mayda, 2013), to higher optimal tariffs that reduce world demand and prices for the imported goods, thus improving the country’s terms of trade. Our analysis is complementary to this terms-of-trade perspective.==== We propose a novel mechanism that also helps explain why tariffs can increase when the economy enjoys a windfall of income.====Finally, our paper is also related to the literature on booms, rent seeking and economic growth, although our goal and approach are very different. For example, income booms can generate politically-driven rent-seeking behaviour that can hurt economic growth (e.g. Tornell and Lane, 1999; Mehlum et al., 2006). In our model, the government’s efforts to favour exporters can also be attributed to rent seeking. However, the rents extracted by these exporters are a consequence of higher prices in domestic markets instead of a direct expropriation of income from the booming sector. Our goal is also different, because we focus on the impact of the shocks on tariff choice rather than on economic growth.====Section 2 motivates our analysis with examples of four countries. Section 3 presents and develops predictions from our analytical model. Section 4 presents our data and baseline empirical results including tests for the potential mechanism of our results. Section 5 presents econometric analysis of heterogeneous and sectoral effects of oil discoveries on tariff changes. It also offers robustness tests with respect to the timing of discoveries and production, and a range of further robustness tests.

But greening the economy also requires changing ","Any significant progress in reconciling economic activities with environmental goals requires technological change (Aghion et al., 2009a, 2009b; Barrett 2009). Most of the literature on induced green technological change has modeled environmental innovations as changes in the ==== through which goods are produced (as opposed to changes in the ==== themselves). For example, the innovation is often represented as a decrease in the cost of abatement technologies (e.g. Goulder and Mathai, 2000; Jaffe et al., 2003) or as an improvement in clean intermediate inputs making dirty technologies less attractive (e.g. Acemoglu et al., 2012; Fischer and Newell, 2008; Nordhaus 2010).====Greening the economy indeed requires cleaner sources of energies or technologies to decrease pollution. But the ==== produced have to change as well. For example, the automotive industry needs to deploy large fleets of electric or hydrogen-based vehicles (Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project, 2015). In the construction sector, new types of designs such as zero-energy buildings have to be broadly adopted (Olsthoorn et al., 2019). The scholarship has so far placed less attention on the drivers and barriers of green technological change when the change required is a new type of product. Doing so, however, requires modeling inter-firms relationships because, nowadays, the design or manufacturing of most products typically occur within supply-chain networks (Timmer et al., 2014).====Indeed, vertically integrated firms are much rarer than a few decades ago. In the 1990s, firms outsourced manufacturing of many components to refocus on core competencies (Feenstra 1998). Among other objectives, they sought to lower labor costs and gain economies of scale. As a result, “mega-suppliers” emerged: that is, upstream firms that supply many, if not most, of final competing producers (Jacobides et al., 2016). For example, in the car manufacturing sector, companies such as Denso or Bosch now supply most final producers. Similarly, in the construction industry, a few firms dominate the upstream market for materials. In this paper, we focus on how the structure of supplier-buyer networks may impact incentives to innovate, and how policies may affect those incentives. Ambitious product innovations typically require changing several components of a product. This in turn means that several firms in the supply-chain must engage in risky investments concurrently. Understanding the incentives in supply-chain networks is therefore essential to learn about how to foster green product innovations. This is particularly pertinent for green product innovation because we need qualitative leaps in the material efficiency of products. This in turn calls for the redesign of whole systems rather than marginal changes to individual components of a product (Geels et al., 2018).====We model green product innovations as upgrades in product quality.==== To do so, we use and extend a Bertrand duopoly game with vertical product differentiation (Anderson et al., 1992; Shaked and Sutton, 1982; Tirole, 1988). We start with a baseline of vertically integrated duopolists and then focus on the case when one upstream firm supplies several competing final producers. An important implication of sharing a supplier is that innovation activities of all the players are now interdependent. Indeed, shared suppliers control the level of innovation for inputs that are complements to final producers.====We find that these shared suppliers face weaker incentives to innovate, thwarting competition for quality between the final producers and acting as innovation bottlenecks. The reason is that shared suppliers have a monopoly choice over the level of innovative effort in the network. Yet, they do not control prices since the producers still compete on prices. Consequently, suppliers are not sufficiently rewarded if they choose to be technologically ambitious, in contrast to vertically integrated producers who control both quality and price. We also study policies that can modify these incentives. We find that price-based policies (e.g., taxes) are less effective than subsidies or procurement to foster a switch to greener products.====The key features of our model are as follows. Firms invest in innovative quality upgrades which increase the environmental quality of their products. Their ambition, however, is bounded by an exogenously defined innovation research frontier. Importantly, we model suppliers as essential actors to the innovation project: their investments are complementary to that of the final producer. This assumption reflects that most ambitious projects require changes to more than one component. Mistakes or underinvestments in any of the critical components can jeopardize the project as a whole (Fixson and Park, 2008; Kremer 1993). Policies enter our model in the following way: 1) a carbon tax increases the marginal value for consumers of a product's environmental quality, and therefore increases the appeal of green products to consumers; 2) subsidies lower the fixed cost of the innovation; and 3) procurement policies increase the market size for a given innovation.====Finally, in an extension, we introduce uncertainty in the direction of technological change and show that institutions that can coordinate expectations about technological direction will increase players’ effort towards green products. Think for example of electric cars vs. hydrogen cars. Both are low-emission vehicles, but they require different components. In our model, we introduce a probability that final producers choose different directions. If they do, shared suppliers lose economies of scope. We find that shared suppliers are then even more reluctant to innovate. In this context, a policy (or institution) that can help coordinate the direction of innovation is found to be complementary to the economic instruments considered (tax, procurement or subsidy).====To summarize, we show that the structure of supply-chain networks can impede innovation. Specifically, we find that, when suppliers are shared, they thwart competition for quality between the final producers and act as innovation bottlenecks. Suppliers further impede innovation when uncertainty in the direction of technological change threatens their economies of scope. These findings are essential to better understand the challenges of transitioning to greener products because, nowadays, production typically relies on a network of suppliers, many of which are shared among several downstream producers. In this context, we also show that taxes would be less effective than subsidies or procurement to foster a switch to greener products.====These results help understand the conditions that enable green product innovation in a mature industry with established players and relationships. First, for all producers to switch to more environmental products, there needs to be a target level of effort (the exogenous research frontier or a technological standard) and a complementary set of economic incentives (tax and market size relative to fixed costs) of the right magnitude given this target. Otherwise, producers differentiate and environmental products remain niche rather than mainstream. Second, industrial structure matters. Innovation is facilitated by vertical integration or exclusive relationships with suppliers. In more complex networks, shared suppliers are key players. In the absence of sufficient incentives, they become roadblocks to innovation. Institutions that can coordinate players then become important. In the discussion section of this paper, we consider each of these implications in more detail. We illustrate them with findings from case studies of the automotive industry and case studies of institutions that have buttressed innovation in previous waves of industrial policy during the 20th century.====Our paper draws on the fields of industrial organization and management to contribute to scholarship on the economics of induced environmental innovation. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we contribute to a small but important literature that draws on the theory of product differentiation to study the incentives for green ==== innovation (André et al., 2009; Conrad 2005; (Cremer and Thisse, 1999); Eriksson 2004). The closest to our paper is that of André et al., (2009), who revisit the Porter Hypothesis in light of a duopoly model of vertical product differentiation. Their main result is similar to our baseline model. They show that a regulatory standard changes the Nash equilibrium of the innovation game in a way that can be beneficial to firms. Indeed, consumers will pay higher prices for higher quality products. Without the standard, firms have an incentive to differentiate to relax price competition.====Viewing environmental innovations as complementary investments across firms is our second contribution. Here, we bridge the literature on the economics of innovation and (green) industrial policy (Aghion et al., 2009a, 2009b; Alic et al., 2003; Ansell 2000; Mazzucato, 2015; Rodrik 2014). The latter often emphasizes public institutions to coordinate actors and catalyze technological change. But, typically, precise mechanisms about the market failures are omitted. Here we provide theoretical support for one mechanism. It recognizes that shared suppliers are critical players in coordinating around a shift to superior technology. But they can also be biased in favor of the status-quo product. Modeling innovations as projects requiring complementary investments also relate to the organization literature that has focused on supply-chain management (e.g., Argyres and Bigelow, 2010; Cachon 2003; Jacobides and Winter 2005; Sturgeon et al., 2008). Finally, our paper also links to the scholarship bridging IO and the economics of innovation. Much of this literature examines the relationship between the boundaries of the firm, market structure and innovation with an important focus on contracting issues (e.g., Aghion and Tirole, 1994; Teece 1986 or more recently Gilson et al., 2009 and Chen and Sappington, 2011).====Section 2 presents our baseline model of green product innovation. It includes the case of integrated producers and the case of parallel supply chains (cases a and b on Fig. 1). Section 3 covers the model with shared suppliers (case c on Fig. 1), and Section 4 the extension on technological uncertainty and coordination failures.

But its effectiveness depends on regulatory differences, which are not reflected in prevailing ==== evidence. We evaluate the actual effect and its spatial distribution of fuel content regulation at four Chinese ports, based on regulatory implementation, wind pattern, and pollutants’ residence time. The regulation caused immediate mitigation effects from the Shanghai Port, but not other ports that faced no penalty or were subject to earlier, more stringent regulations. Pollution mitigation from the Shanghai Port extended to more than 200 km away, far beyond the empirical focus of local externalities from transportation. We estimate a regulatory cost of 0.77–1.6 billion US dollars, considering causal effects of the regulation on shipping price and throughput. The cost is larger than the price difference from fuel switch, but much smaller than estimated health benefits.","Maritime transportation plays an essential role in international trade, but is also a major source of pollution, due to low fuel quality and poor emission control. Oceangoing ships contributed to 12% of global sulfur oxides (SO====) emissions, 13% of nitrogen oxides (NO====), and 2.6% of CO==== during 2007–2012 (Smith et al., 2015). Ship emissions of fine particulate matter (PM====) alone have been predicted to cause 403,300 premature deaths and 14 million instances of childhood asthma annually (Sofiev et al., 2018).====A common regulation to protect human health against maritime transportation pollution is to set up emission control areas (ECAs) at ports and surrounding sea areas. Vessels operating in those areas are primarily required to lower fuel sulfur content for SO==== reduction, and often required to use high-standard diesel engines for NO==== reduction and take alternative measures such as scrubbers and port electrification. ECAs have been set up for the Baltic Sea, the North Sea, other ports in the European Union, the North American coast, the United States Caribbean Sea area, and Chinese ports and surrounding areas. But many other ports and associated emissions in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have not been regulated; the unregulated ports handle roughly half of the world cargo and container throughput; areas surrounding the largest unregulated ports account for a population of 255 million and GDP of 4,984 billion US dollars (Table A.1 in Appendix A). An unprecedented progression has been taken into force by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to limit fuel sulfur content from 3.5% to 0.5% by mass for all ships globally – except in ECAs of stricter limits – since 1 January 2020.====Given the popularity of ECAs and the IMO’s global endeavor, it is of important policy implications whether these fuel-content regulations effectively reduced pollution that mattered to human health, and how efficient they were. The existing literature addresses the questions from an ==== perspective and consistently predicts that fuel-content regulation from the global scale (Winebrake et al., 2009; Sofiev et al., 2018) to regional ECAs (Corbett et al., 2007a; Kalli et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2018b; Viana et al., 2015) would reduce pollution, based on emission inventories, scenarios, and simulations. But ==== evaluation often suggests that regulatory effectiveness depends on the differences in policy formulation and implementation. Particularly relevant to the case of ECAs, previous research shows that regulatory flexibility makes fuel and transportation regulations ineffective (e.g. Bonilla 2019; Auffhammer and Kellogg 2011; Davis 2008; Eskeland and Feyzioglu 1997; Gallego et al., 2013).====By focusing on fuel-content regulation in China’s first domestic ECAs in its Yangtze River Delta region on 1 April 2016, this article assesses the effectiveness, benefits, and costs of multiple ECAs with differences in implementation and earlier regulations. The regulation required all ships to use fuels of sulfur content below 0.5% instead of the IMO limit of 3.5% at four major ports of the region, including Ningbo-Zhoushan and Shanghai, two busiest ports of the world. We show that the fuel-content regulation at ports immediately reduced major types of pollutants by more than 15%; the effects were only from the Shanghai Port, but not similarly busy ports which had earlier, more stringent regulations or no penalty for non-compliance. The differential effects of ECAs are not captured by previous ==== research, which usually assumes full compliance and shows optimistic mitigation. In particular, we show that penalty for non-compliance is important to the enforcement of ECAs.====The average effect of the ECAs on regional pollution mitigation is estimated by a time-series regression discontinuity design and a difference-in-discontinuity strategy using the same period in the next year as control. To differentiate pollution mitigation from different ports and their spatial distribution, we develop a causal inference strategy based on hourly wind patterns between location pairs and pollutants’ different residence time. To our knowledge, this is the first effort to integrate pollutant residence time from atmospheric science into an empirical identification strategy. In addition, the identification strategy benefits from finer resolution of wind patterns on hourly basis and at both pollution source and receptor ends. All of these make it possible and more accurate to estimate spatial dispersion of pollution.====With this identification strategy, we not only separate ineffective ECAs from effective ones of geographical proximity, but also reveal the spatial extent of an ECA’s effects being extended to areas beyond 200 km away from the ports. This finding of long-distance externalities complements the focus of local externalities within 20 miles or a city scale from transportation sector (Knittel et al., 2016; Moretti and Neidell 2011; Schlenker and Walker 2016) and related policies (Luechinger and Roth 2016; Fu and Gu 2017; Currie and Walker 2011; Marcus 2017; Ngo 2017; Gibson and Carnovale 2015; Wolff 2014; Davis 2008; Bonilla 2019; Auffhammer and Kellogg 2011; Viard and Fu 2015) in the literature.====In addition to the pollution mitigation effects, we also evaluate the costs of regulation-induced changes in both shipping price and port throughput, based on an event study and a synthetic control method (SCM), respectively. The results are compared with the regulatory benefits using back-of-the-envelope calculations based on causally identified pollution mitigation effects. Estimated health benefits are 23,800 avoided premature death or 50.7 billion US dollars annually, accounting for 3.33% of the regional GDP. Regulatory costs are transient, about 1.51–3.23% of the benefits. The high benefit-to-cost ratio is driven by extremely high concentration of population and shipping transportation in Yangtze River Delta.",The effects of fuel content regulation at ports on regional pollution and shipping industry,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069621000073,30 January 2021,2021,Research Article,178.0

We address this gap by estimating local economic effects from commercial fishing activity in Alaska. Using exogenous variation in fish stocks and prices, we find that a 10% increase in a community's annual resident fishery earnings leads to a corresponding 0.7% increase in resident income. This translates to an increase of 1.54 dollars in total income for each dollar increase in fisheries earnings. Our results demonstrate the potential for local benefits from commercial fishing through direct, indirect, and induced effects into other sectors. Moreover, our findings demonstrate the importance of local resource ownership for generating benefits for local economies.","Do commercial fisheries contribute to local economies? The answer to this question is often presumed to be yes and plays an influential role in the decisions of policy makers, despite little empirical evidence to support this claim. This is surprising since natural resources are generally not guaranteed to contribute significantly to local economies (van der Ploeg, 2011; James and Aadland, 2011). Indeed, it is not uncommon to find resource-rich regions lacking the pre-conditions required for resources to contribute to local economies in a meaningful way (Tiebout, 1956; Swales, 2005; Kilkenny and Partridge, 2009). In this paper, we estimate direct and spillover effects from Alaskan commercial fisheries on local wages, employment, and income using a community-level panel dataset of commercial fishing and formal-sector employment records. We exploit exogenous variation in fish stocks and prices, and adapt the empirical methodology of Moretti (2010) by employing a shift-share instrument (Bartik, 1991) to address potential endogeneity concerns. Given the size and importance of the commercial fishing industry for coastal economies, empirical verification of the local economic benefits from commercial fisheries is long overdue.====We provide empirical evidence demonstrating commercial fisheries contribute to local economies. We find that commercially exploited fish stocks have positive direct effects: additional fishing and processing crew are hired, and processed harvests produce more value added. We also find statistical evidence of employment spillovers from commercial fishing into non-fishing sectors: a 10% increase in annual fishery earnings leads to a 0.3% increase in employment, which translates to 7.12 jobs per million dollars of fishery earnings. Overall, we find an increase of one dollar in fisheries earnings results in an increase of total income by 1.54 dollars. Our empirical results also suggest that the primary channel through which spillover effects take place is the earnings of local commercial-fishing permit owners, as opposed to the delivery (or landing) of fish to local businesses for value-added processing.====Our findings have important implications for resource development policies. First, local economies can benefit from resource development, even if they lack ideal conditions for resources to contribute in a meaningful way. Indeed, while the size of the commercial fishing sector in Alaska is significant, spillover benefits may still come as a surprise, given that a large portion of intermediate inputs used in the production of seafood is imported, Alaskan residents make up only half the crew and one-third of the processing labor force, and Alaskan-owned fishing and processing permits account for only a small fraction of the value of processed and harvested fish. Nevertheless, the fraction of resource rents accruing to local owners does provide spillover benefits to local economies. Local permit ownership creates an opportunity for fishery earnings to be spent locally on goods and services, in addition to hiring local crew members—who in turn, are also more likely to spend their earnings locally. This creates an induced effect in the local economy. In contrast, the wage and ownership earnings from seafood processing tend to accrue to non-residents, who are less likely to spend their money locally, resulting in leakage from the local economy.====More broadly, policies aimed towards increasing local resource-extraction activities may not reinforce local economies if either (====) the local labor force is comprised primarily of non-resident/migrant workers, or (====) residents do not have an ownership stake in their local resources. The former implication has considerable theoretical (e.g., Moretti, 2011; Kline and Moretti, 2014) and empirical (Partridge et al., 2009; Wrenn et al., 2015; Guettabi and James, 2020) support. The latter implication, while intuitive, has only recently gained attention. Indeed, while the local economic effects of non-renewable resource sectors have received considerable attention in the literature, the vast majority of this work investigates the economic effects of resource-extraction activities, as opposed to the economic effects from resource ownership (Marchand and Weber, 2018). One exception is a recent study by Brown et al. (2019), which demonstrates that royalty payments from oil and gas leases account for a large share of the total income effect of extraction. Indeed, Brown et al. (2019) find that a one dollar increase in oil and gas royalties is associated with an increase of 1.49 cents in total income for the royalty owner's county. This is similar to the increase of 1.54 cents of total income we find are associated with a one dollar increase in local permit-owner earnings.====Finally, our findings add support to the idea that place-based policies—regardless of whether their focus is on resource development—must be tailored to local conditions (Bartik, 2020). That is, broad-based policies that treat local economies uniformly are not likely to perform well if local economies are heterogeneous. For example, our results demonstrate that conventional policies whose goal is to redirect the value of commercial fisheries landings to local economies—such as allocating individual processing quotas (Matulich et al., 1996; Matulich and Sever, 1999), imposing restrictions to deliver fish to particular ports (Cojocaru et al., 2019), and restricting the trade of individual fishing quotas (Kroetz et al., 2015)—may not produce their intended benefits. Indeed, heterogeneous effects suggest that communities with higher rates of local processor ownership and more dependence on the commercial fisheries sector are more likely to experience benefits from local commercial fishing landings. Thus, depending on local conditions, some communities may benefit from policies that favor local processing businesses and/or enhance forward-and-backward linkages across sectors, while others may benefit from policies aimed to attract or retain resident fishery permit owners. In other words, context matters when designing policy.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss the relevant literature, the nature of cross-sector spillovers, and details of the commercial fishing industry in Alaska. Section 3 describes our data and our empirical strategy. We present our results in Section 4, including extensions to test for heterogeneity and robustness. We conclude with a discussion of the implications and limitations of our work, in addition to opportunities for future research.",Commercial fisheries & local economies,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069621000024,27 January 2021,2021,Research Article,179.0

We investigate the parameters that affect the magnitude of this gap and assess the effect of the gap on the adoption of clean technologies overtime.,"A large body of political science literature on Western democracies suggests that the diversity in values among political parties result in eventual changes of policy because over time parties' transition to and from power, and different parties emphasize different values (Gunther and Diamond, 2003). However, how does this likelihood of regime change in future periods affect forward-looking politicians’ choice of policy instruments? We ask this question while focusing on policies that address externalities and lead to replacement of polluting technologies with clean alternatives. In particular, we develop a framework to determine the optimal tax set by a ruling party that recognizes the likelihood of losing power, and then investigate the optimal tax given alternative assumptions about the political economy.====We incorporate political uncertainty into our analysis of environmental policy design while focusing on policy durability. We assume that some politicians place more weight on the environment than others and that politicians recognize the transition of power among ruling parties over time. We strive to understand the choice of financial incentives to address externality problems in a world where the ramifications of political transitions are understood. For the sake of clarity and brevity, we use the following simplifying assumption: We assume a putty–clay technology, where each unit employs its own fixed proportion technology in the short run that can be modified through investment in the long run (Johansen, 1972).====Our basic description of the technology starts at the firm level. The ex-ante (long-run) production function indicates the possibilities from which the firm chooses from when new production process is being established – “the production function which includes all possibility design” (Salter, 1960, p. 15). We focus on capacity, and on input use at full capacity, when describing the new production process. Once the firm's production function is established, however, the optimal scale – i.e., the optimal level of capacity at which inputs per unit of output are lower than all other capacity levels, is set. That is, the ex post (short run) production function is of fixed proportion. Ex ante (long-run) the putty-clay technology assumes substitutability among factors of production, yet ex post (short-run) after machines are installed and investments made the putty-clay model assumes factors of production are complements. To this end, Fuss (1978) supports the notion that capital and energy are complements in the short run but substitutes in the long run. In addition, Atkeson and Kehow (1999) show that the putty-clay model is a better predictor for the response of capital to changes in energy prices than the putty-putty (neoclassical) production model. These characteristics of the putty-clay production function were used to explain why the energy crisis of 1973-74 happened at the same time a dramatic decline in U.S. stock market capitalization was observed (Wei, 2003), and to show the substantial role of putty-clay capital in explaining business cycles (Gilchrist & Williams, 2000). We believe the putty-clay assumptions characterize capital intensive industries like the power sector: initially, the utility company chooses the plants energy feedstock and capacity. However, once capacity and technology are chosen, plants production in the short-run is usually described through fixed-proportion (e.g., cost per kWh).====Assuming putty–clay technology enables us to arrive at simple expressions whose outcomes can be depicted in two-dimensional figures. Putty–clay technologies are a reasonable approximation of several capital-intensive industries (e.g., the electricity sector) and have been used in the past for analysis of environmental policies.==== In addition, pollution-intensive industries are usually capital-intensive industries (Cole and Elliott, 2005), which are the focus of this paper. We also assume heterogeneity among firms of a given industry. To this end, Lyubich et al. (2018) demonstrated the importance of heterogeneity, showing substantial differences among firms within narrowly defined industries. Lyubich et al. showed that the differences between the 90th percentile and the 10th percentile of a typical industry's energy productivity is 580 percent. The heterogeneity among firms has important implications for policy design and its impact on policy durability, as will be illustrated in this work.====The analysis shows that given political uncertainty, when policymakers consider levying a tax, the party that places more weight on the environment may set an optimal tax that is larger than the Pigouvian tax. We term the difference between the optimal tax and the dynamic Pigouvian tax the ====. Because investment is irreversible, these changes in production are immune to future policy regressions ushered by an environmentally-unfriendly challenger. Thus, an environmentally-friendly incumbent ushers in current-period policy and ties the hands of future governments. The difference in adoption rates because of the political uncertainty tax premium increases when: (i) the pollution decay is slower; (ii) the weight placed on future outcomes increases; (iii) the uncertainty regarding future elections increases; and (iv) voter tendency to vote in support of lower pollution increases. The economic ramifications of political uncertainty become more pronounced, as demand becomes more elastic, with the tax incidence falling on the producers and more firms exiting the industry and becoming idle than would otherwise. We show this using the theoretical model and also through our numerical example. We also illustrate numerically several key outcomes: higher taxes result in more adoption of clean technologies, and the most-polluting units of production stop operating; and that the cleaner the alternative technology, the larger the effect of policy on the intensive margins, with a smaller impact on production.====Throughout recent decades we witness many times how governments in democratic regimes usher in policy that results in the adoption of capital embodied technologies. Although overtime the administration and public opinions changed, the technical changes continued and were unsusceptible to the political winds of change. The changes in perspectives on climate change and other policies between presidents Obama and Trump illustrate this point. The Obama administration used the Antiquities Act of 1906 more times than any other administration in history, trying to solidify policy outcomes that would be difficult for the incoming Trump administration to reverse. Its regulation led to adoption of technologies that impacted states from California to Texas. Although the Trump administration rolled-back many EPA regulations, the U.S. Energy Information Agency projects that U.S. coal consumption declined 4% in 2019 to 691 million short tons, suggesting coal has declined by 44% since its peak usage in 2007, even though solar and wind consumption continued to increase.==== Furthermore, the US is expected to more than double its photovoltaic capacity from 2018 to 2023. In 2018 California produced almost 23 GW of electricity from photovoltaic sources and is home to the Topaz Solar Farm, a photovoltaic facility with a capacity to produce 550 MW of electricity. In 2016, the solar industry in the US employed 373,807 workers (DOE 2017). In comparison, coal electric generation employs in 2016 only 86,035 workers.====Germany's low carbon plan, ====, is yet another example: the political environment in Germany during the 1990s yielded an unlikely outcome of a coalition of hydropower, wind, Green Party, Social Democrats and the German Environment Ministry. This coalition was formed because of environmental concerns, promotion of renewable and anti-nuclear sentiment (Laird & Stefes 2009). It resulted in the Germany government ushering in financial incentives in the form of feed-in-tariffs that resulted in high adoption rates of wind turbines and solar cell technologies (Jacobsson & Lauber, 2006), as well as wide deployment of anaerobic digester technologies (Bangalore et al., 2016). These laws led to an almost 100-fold rise in wind installations in Germany and resulted in large parts of the German population becoming invested in renewable technologies through ownership and manufacturing. Germany is now recognized as a global leader in these technologies. These changes took place even though the German transition to a low carbon economy plan, namely, ====, was amended several times. Those opposed to the feed-in tariffs kept arguing that the tariffs were too high and in 2004 “certain Christian Democratic Union (CDU) politicians [even] began to question whether a feed-in tariff with such high rates was … necessary” (Leiren and Reimer, 2018, p. 36). Key to the federal elections of 2013 was the cost of the ====, leading in 2016 to an auction system that replaced the feed-in tariffs. Despite the feed-in tariff legislation being contested many times, especially during election periods, and repealed in 2016, in 2020 Germany is clearly a global leader in both wind and solar.====Several scholars have recognized politicians’ incentive to manipulate current policy and influence both elections and the policy choices of future governments (e.g., Persson and Svensson, 1989; Aghion and Bolton, 1990; Tabellini and Alesina, 1990; Persson and Tabellini, 2000; Azzimonti, 2011; Millner, 2013). While the environmental economics literature has recognized the importance of technological and biophysical uncertainty and irreversibility in investment decisions, the importance of political or electoral uncertainty and its effect on policy durability has not been incorporated in determining policy instruments. To this end, we elected to focus on tax policy since it enables us to identify factors affecting policy ushered in by an incumbent government, thus clearly identifying current, dynamic, and political drivers affecting the design of the optimal political-economy tax.====We emphasize that politicians recognize that power rotates among parties and thus the importance of enacting policies that will not be overruled in the long run – namely, policy durability. A large body of literature emphasizes the differences between politicians' objectives and voters’ objectives, and investigates the implications for policy (e.g., Persson and Tabellini, 1999; Acemoglu and Robinson, 2001; Grossman and Helpman, 2001; Bohn, 2007; Rausser et al., 2011). Different from this literature, this work investigates the implication of electoral uncertainty on policy durability.====This paper also aims to contribute to the extensive literature on the selection of environmental policies, which is aimed at correcting market failures and introduces the missing markets for pollution. The literature originated with the foundational work of Pigou (1932) and was later expanded by Baumol and Oates (1971), Weitzman (1974), Buchanan and Tullock (1975), Laffont and Tirole (1996a, 1996b), Holland (2012), and Tombe and Winter (2015), among many others. As the literature evolved, it incorporated considerations of political economic motives (e.g., Buchanan and Tullock, 1975; Hochman and Zilberman, 1978), uncertainty regarding economic outcomes (e.g., Weitzman, 1974), dynamics (e.g., Caparros et al., 2015), and the development of policy instruments (e.g., Laffont and Tirole, 1996a; 1996b). In much of the literature, the selected policies affected pollution by inducing the adoption of cleaner technologies. When political uncertainty is introduced, firms’ incentives change, and this impacts policy design. Given the irreversibility of investment, Fisher and Narain (2003) assumed the stock of greenhouse gases (GHGs) constitute a risk of future damages of unknown magnitude while Gollier and Treich (2003) investigated the effect of scientific uncertainty. Political uncertainty via the likelihood of nationalization also tends to distort the allocation of the resource (Van Long 1975; Bohn and Deacon 2000; Davis 2001, among other). This paper, however, focuses on a different type of uncertainty, namely, political uncertainty, which impacts policy durability. The political transition among parties with different perspectives about the environment may result in an environmentally friendly party ushering an optimal policy that is stricter than the optimal policy that maximizes social welfare. With a putty-clay technology, this will lead to more irreversible outcomes.====The paper proceeds as follows. The capital-intensive industry is introduced in section II. Section III describes the political actors and the game. The analysis begins in section IV, while focusing on the two-period game, and continues with the numerical solution in section V. New insights regarding elections and adoptions are developed in section VI. The model is generalized to multiple periods in section VII.

While recycling increased by 15 percent, total MSW decreased by 27 percent overall between August 2015 and July 2017. Our results also demonstrate heterogeneity in response to a Clear Bag Policy across neighborhoods with varying socioeconomic indicators. Our findings suggest that green nudges can serve as effective policy instruments in devising future ====.","The astounding growth in Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) generation over the last three decades continues to inflict substantial management costs and a heavy environmental burden on citizens and local governments alike. Higher income and wealth, with their resulting increase in the consumption of goods and services, higher urbanization rates, and changes in production methods leading to a greater use of packaging materials, are deemed to be the chief factors (D'Amato et al., 2016). Excessive amounts of waste or garbage are notoriously found in oceans and in the food chain and are increasingly being traced back into our food. The over consumption of resources and the creation of plastics has become one of today's most pressing environmental challenges (Hoomweg and Bhada-Tata, 2012; Barr et al., 2001; Zacho and Mosgaard, 2016). Until recently, China was the dominant market for recycled plastic, and its announcement in 2018 that it would no longer accept recyclables (i.e., plastic, paper, and textile) has intensified many countries' already pressing MSW problem. Alternatives to shipping plastics overseas are limited: incineration is typically frowned upon because of the air pollution it produces, and many places are already facing space constraints in landfills.====The bulk of waste management policies in many countries have relied on “end of pipe” approaches. The objective was to achieve greater levels of recycling or to improve waste disposal management (Cecere et al., 2014; Kinnaman et al., 2014; Zacho and Mosgaard, 2016). Mandatory and voluntary recycling programs as well as price incentive and non-price incentive programs were among the different types of policies implemented (Dahlen and Lagerkvist, 2010). In addition to environmental policies merely motivated by changing economic incentives, policy makers are increasingly incorporating psycho-social content of preferences including extrinsic motivations such as social norms and intrinsic motivations such as altruistic preferences in the design of the environment policies, particularly to encourage waste prevention.==== As importantly, these new policies aim at utilizing the power of social influence and moral tax in their design.==== Because people typically care about their self-image and often follow the crowd, perceptions of what other people do - obtained either directly or indirectly, through information given by a third party - have a powerful influence on agents’ behaviors (Nolan et al., 2008; in Schubert, 2017, p.332).====Informed by insights in behavioral economics, “green nudges”, a concept developed by Thaler and Sunstein (2008), are also being used increasingly in environmental policy to “gently push individuals in the right direction” (Alpizar and Gsottbauer, 2015; Schubert, 2017; Carlsson et al., 2019). One type of effective green nudge is making the green option the default option.==== For example, in 2010, the local government of Fort Collins, Ohio, implemented a policy which switched the size of the garbage bins: the recycling went into a large 90-gallon container, while the refuse went into a smaller 35-gallon container.==== As a result, households increased their recycling efforts, showing that people tend to recycle as much as they are given space to do so.====To date, however, green nudges applied to MSW remain rare (Carlsson et al., 2019). In this paper, we attempt to fill the void in the literature by examining the causal effects of a green nudge, the mandatory use of clear plastic bags, on recycling, waste generation and prevention behaviors of households. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first papers that quantifies the effectiveness of a moral green nudge policy in MSW. The “Clear Bag Policy” has been instituted by the Regional Municipality Solid Waste Resources Department in the summer of 2015 in a medium size city in Canada with hopes of nudging households towards more responsible sorting and potentially reducing waste generation (Pemberton, 2018). The policy was universally implemented in all garbage collection areas and the municipality is the sole garbage collector in our setting; both of which further speak to it being a top down policy. Under the new garbage collection policy, households were mandated to replace the black garbage bags used for the disposal of the refuse with the clear, transparent bags while one dark bag was permitted for privacy. This new garbage collection policy can be classified as a moral green nudge since its design incorporated the various aspects of nudges we described earlier. Policies such as the Clear Bag policy we study in our paper cost relatively little to administer and implement by local governments, and have the potential to alleviate some of the MSW challenges. Therefore, it is of policy interest to credibly quantify the effectiveness of green nudge policies increasingly being implemented in environmental policy on promoting recycling, better sorting, and ultimately reducing total waste.====Further, in our paper we provide suggestive evidence on the potential heterogeneous effects of the Clear Bag Policy across garbage collection areas with various socio-economic indicators. Previous studies have shown that economic instruments such as income, education, and social influence are key factors explaining the patterns in selective sorting behavior (Meyer, 2015; Kirakozian, 2016), while the prevention of waste does not seem to be motivated by social pressure or norms, or by economic incentives (Barr et al., 2001). Our analysis indeed demonstrates a significant heterogeneity in response to the policy change by education and income.====Essential to the purpose of this paper, the sharp and unexpected policy change in the garbage collection rules instituted in the summer of 2015 provides us with a unique quasi-experimental setting to causally estimate the effects of green nudge waste management policies on households’ recycling and waste generation behaviors. More specifically, we exploit the discrete and abrupt change in the waste management rules engendered by the Clear Bag Policy to implement a highly credible RD design. This design exploits the differences in total waste, recycling, and refuse amounts and rates in the weeks preceding and following August 1st, 2015, the date the policy was launched.====We conduct our analysis using administrative municipal data on daily solid waste, where every weekday corresponds to a garbage collection area. Our data covers the entire population we study and provides detailed daily information on the amount of refuse, recycling, organics and total solid waste spanning several years before and after the implementation of the Clear Bag Policy. In this study, we focus on the downtown core and its five collection areas, each corresponding to a given day in the week. These areas were determined to allow for about the same number of trucks, staff and completion times on any given day (Pemberton, 2018).====Our novel administrative data offers several advantages over the previous research on the waste management, which utilize survey data. First, in contrast to previous studies,==== these data cover all the available information on household solid waste, thereby, we have information on the entire population. Since the municipality is the sole collector of garbage and because the policy was applied to all dwellings in the community (except large apartment complexes), our analysis effectively addresses any potential selection bias in participation to the policy or sorting around the announcement of the policy. Second, as our data represent daily records on solid waste, it allows us to estimate the effects of the green nudge policy more precisely, compared to previous research, which mainly utilize monthly or annual survey waste data. Third, having access to daily data allows us to identify the effects of the policy change within narrow bandwidths spanning several months at the maximum; thereby significantly mitigating the possibility of the potential confounders and other policy changes which could have risen in the analysis using the monthly or annual data. Further, we are able to observe both the immediate and medium-run effects of the Clear Bag Policy since our data spans several years before and after the policy change. This could potentially inform and aid policy makers in their design of the new environmental policies.====Using RD design on this universe administrative data, our analysis shows that the Clear Bag Policy has been effective in increasing recycling and reducing both refuse and overall MSW. More specifically, we find in our RD robust specification controlling for bias and variance and garbage collection area dummies that the Clear Bag Policy led to a 27 percent reduction in overall MSW, while increasing recycling by 15 percent compared to the pre-policy period. Our results also point to a substitution between refuse and recycling, suggesting households improved effort in more responsible recycling after the policy. We further find suggestive evidence that areas with lower average income and educational attainment exhibit more significant improvements in their waste management and generation, thereby demonstrating that green nudges could also be effective in alleviating differences in waste management across socioeconomic status. An increasing diversion of the redeemable items, clothing and small appliances from landfill and the growing use of the commercial garbage for fee are potential mediators explaining our findings. Our results are robust to a variety of alternative RD specifications with different data-driven bandwidth selection procedures, equal and different bandwidths in each side of the cut-off, a different degree of polynomials in running variable, non-parametric kernel estimations and a battery of different placebo cut-offs.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a brief overview of Halifax Regional Municipality, some background on waste management policies and a description of the Clear Bag Policy instituted in August 2015; Section 3 describes our data; Section 4 discusses the identification strategy; Section 5 presents the main results, extensions and robustness checks; Section 6 includes the discussion of the results and Section 7 concludes.",The effects of a green nudge on municipal solid waste: Evidence from a clear bag policy,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069620301273,21 January 2021,2021,Research Article,181.0

In this paper, we theoretically and numerically explore the effect of imperfect taxation on the public provision of mortality risk reductions (or public safety). We show that this effect critically depends on the source of imperfection as well as on the individual utility and survival probability functions. Our simulations based on the calibration of distributional weights and applied to the COVID-19 example suggest that the value per statistical life, and in turn the optimal level of public safety, should be adjusted downwards because of imperfect taxation. However, we also identify circumstances under which this result is reversed, so that imperfect taxation cannot generically justify less public safety.","Mortality reduction represents a significant part of the benefit of many environmental projects. For instance, it has been estimated to account for more than 90% of the monetized benefit of the Clean Air Act (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2011). A standard practice to evaluate this benefit is to use benefit cost analysis (BCA) based on the willingness to pay approach. In the context of the evaluation of a mortality risk reduction project, this amounts to using the value of statistical life (VSL) approach.==== Importantly, BCA and thus the VSL approach traditionally assumes that the financing of a project is “perfect” in the sense that taxation optimally accounts for the heterogeneity of taxpayers, and does not create distortions such as labor supply distortions. In this paper, we relax this assumption and examine how the imperfections of the taxation system affect the optimal level of public safety, and in turn whether adjustments in the standard VSL approach are warranted.====Accounting for imperfect taxation in the evaluation of mortality reduction benefits in public safety projects is important for several reasons. First, it is well documented that the taxation system is imperfect in both developed and developing countries and that the degree of imperfection varies widely across the world (Tanzi and Zee 2001).==== Second, from a policy perspective, various guidelines encourage policy evaluations to also include in BCA “distributive impacts”, “equity”, or “environmental justice” (European Commission 2009; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2016a). But it is also well known that concrete methodologies for evaluating such additional impacts remain undeveloped (Adler 2008). Moreover, safety issues usually raise strong equity concerns that call for a careful and systematic analysis of distributive impacts, as illustrated by the economic policy discussions about the COVID-19 pandemic (Adler 2020). Third, the literature in public economics has long debated in general settings the issue of the optimal provision of public goods under distortionary taxes and individual heterogeneities (Atkinson and Stiglitz 1980). It thus seems useful to examine a specific but important domain of application such as public safety provision. A starting point to do so is to develop a comparative statics analysis of the effect of taxation system imperfections on the optimal level of public safety.====In our analysis, we proceed as follows. We compare the optimal level of public safety selected by a utilitarian social planner under three exogenous benchmark types of the taxation system: individual lump-sum tax (first-best), uniform lump-sum tax (uniform tax) and uniform flat tax (income tax).==== We consider in turn two types of individual heterogeneity, namely wealth and mortality risk heterogeneity, and we also consider distortionary taxation. Our primary results are the following. Under wealth heterogeneity, compared with the first-best level of public safety, we show that the optimal level of public safety provision is usually lower under uniform taxation, but that it can be greater under income taxation. Under mortality risk heterogeneity, the comparison is generally ambiguous, as it typically depends on whether the heterogeneity concerns the baseline risk or the reduction in risk. Finally, we show that under reasonable assumptions on labor supply and the shape of the utility function, public safety under first-best is generally higher compared to distortionary taxation.====From this theoretical analysis, we conclude that the imperfection of the taxation system cannot generically justify more or less public safety provision. The basic intuition is simple. Take the wealth heterogeneity case for example. Under perfect taxation, the rich are taxed more than the poor. Imperfect taxation shifts some of the tax burden from the rich to the poor. Thus, the rich are relatively richer and would prefer more public safety, whereas the poor are relatively poorer and would prefer less public safety. Depending on the shape of the utility function, the demand for safety of the rich may, or may not, over shadow that of the poor, so that more or less safety should be provided. Hence, the answer about which effect dominates is essentially empirical.====At the end of the paper, we discuss some policy implications. In particular, we develop some simulation exercises based on the calibration of distributional weights using data from the U.S. population. These simulations indicate that the VSL, and in turn the optimal level of public safety, should be significantly adjusted downwards because of imperfect taxation. For instance, in our illustrative analysis of the COVID-19 early prevention policy, the induced weighted VSL should be reduced by about one-third under uniform taxation compared to the first-best case.====Our paper builds on two strands of literature: the VSL and the optimal provision of public good literature. First, the VSL represents the individual's marginal willingness to pay for a small reduction in mortality risk (Drèze 1962; Jones-Lee 1974). The VSL literature has examined both theoretically and empirically how VSL varies with the characteristics of individuals or of the decision-making environment (Andersson and Treich 2011; Viscusi and Aldy 2003). However, the vast majority of this literature has ignored the issue of imperfect taxation, with two notable exceptions. Pratt and Zeckhauser (1996) study the optimal allocation of safety among heterogeneous individuals under uniform taxation.==== Armantier and Treich (2004) examine the bias induced by the standard VSL approach under uniform taxation when individuals are heterogeneous in wealth and mortality risk. However, these two papers do not compare the impact of various taxation systems. Moreover, they do not consider labor supply distortions.====Second, in the public good provision literature, a standard reference is the Pigou conjecture. Pigou (1947) states that, under distortionary taxation, the marginal benefit of the public good should be greater than the marginal production cost, implying a lower provision of the public good.==== This conjecture led to the development of the marginal cost of public funds (====) concept, which was first incorporated into Samuelson's rule for the optimal public good provision by Stiglitz and Dasgupta (1971), Diamond and Mirrlees (1971) and Atkinson and Stern (1974). If Pigou's conjecture holds, the value of MCPF should be greater than 1. However, the literature has shown that this conjecture holds only under specific settings and that the value of the MCPF depends on the relationship between the public good, labor supply, and the taxed activities (Atkinson and Stern 1974; Ballard and Fullerton 1992; Stiglitz and Dasgupta 1971). Gaube (2000) shows for instance that with heterogeneous households, equity considerations may increase public expenditure in the second-best. In practice, BCA typically recommends using an MCPF larger than one to account for imperfect taxation, which seems questionable given the lack of consensus in the literature. Although the MCPF has been extensively studied, we are not aware of any specific application to public safety. Moreover, most of the literature in public economics examines the level and properties of optimal public good provision under a specific taxation system, but does not compare various systems. Thus, we contribute to this literature by considering a public safety setting, and by developing a comparative statics analysis of different taxation systems.====Before proceeding further with the model, we want to stress two strong limitations. The first is that the model is most directly applicable to government-funded public safety programs that are financed by taxes. We have in mind for instance public clean-up programs (such as those concerning sites contaminated with hazardous substances), infrastructure investments (such as those improving transport safety or reducing flood risks), water sanitation, R&D research in health, or nuclear wastes management. However, in reality, many public safety programs are based on regulations that impose costs on private firms and households. Our model is not directly relevant to this latter form of regulation that would typically require a precise modeling of the polluting industry market structure and of the households’ demand for the goods produced by that industry.==== The second important limitation is that the model is static. However, many mortality risks are long term risks which affect the dynamics of private decisions such as self-protection, insurance demand, borrowing and savings (Shepard and Zeckhauser 1984). Moreover, the optimal fiscal policy is better conceived in a dynamic setting (Motta and Rossi 2019; Werning 2007). Here, we abstract from the various complexities induced by a dynamic model with a sequence of public intervention and individual decisions, including that of time-inconsistency.",Public safety under imperfect taxation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069621000048,20 January 2021,2021,Research Article,182.0

Small urban green areas offer amenities that affect residential choices, land consumption and land rent. This paper discusses the land use and locations of those areas and the resulting residential space allocation. It is shown that the land share dedicated to small urban green areas results from the trade-off between land value and population density and is a single peaked function of the distance to the city center. This result is confirmed by the empirical study of urban structures in the 305 largest EU cities using GIS data. This spatial pattern is shown to be robust to many measures of ====.","Urban green areas play a crucial role in the debate on sustainable cities. They are an important part of any urban area whose quality and quantity are prime concerns for environmental sustainability. Recent research has confirmed the relationship between urban parks and the well-being of city's residents. Brack (2002) and Strohbach et al. (2012) find a strong influence of urban natural ecosystems in reducing air and noise pollution and ==== absorption in Australia and Germany. Heidt and Neef (2008) find economic benefits by showing a significant increase in the nearby property values. Access to nearby urban parks helps reduce stress and improve psychological well-being==== and physical activities.====In European cities, urban green areas are generally small, scattered and close to each other. As shown in Table 1, on average, residents find a urban green area at less than about 350m from their residences (about 6 min walk) while more than 90% of urban green areas are smaller than squares of about 300m length (i.e. surface smaller than 100,000 ====). Finally the numbers of urban green areas with each city are roughly proportionate to the city populations.====In this paper, we study the optimal level of small and scattered urban green areas in urban spaces. Small urban green areas are land-intensive and offer very localized amenities. Using those properties, we find that the relationship between the share of surface devoted to urban green areas can be a single peaked function of the distance to the city center. On the one hand, the opportunity cost of land is too expensive in the city center for the planner to implement many green areas there. On the other hand, residents are too sparse at the city edges to give planners the incentives to invest in such very localized amenities. The main contribution of the paper is to confirm our results using the very detailed GIS geographical database of the European Environment Agency's Urban Atlas data, which describes the land use of 305 EU cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants. These data report land use and cover across Europe using harmonized Earth Observations (EOs), which are combined with Eurostat Urban Audit statistical data. The data represent a unique source of reliable and comparable European urban planning data. As far as we know, this is the first paper that uses both a theoretical model and empirical estimation of European urban land use. Our finding of a peaked relationship is robust to many variations of the land use specifications, city structure specifications, and city and country characteristics.====Our contribution relates to several strands of the economics literature. First, urban green areas share the nature of a local public good. Since Tiebout (1956), economists have discussed the issue of resident mobility and democratic decision making over local public goods (voting with feet). Fujita (1986), Cremer et al. (1985) and Sakashita (1987) discuss the problem of the optimal location of local public goods and find that local public goods should spread to equidistant locations. Fujita (1986) studies the optimal allocation of “neighborhood goods” (localized and congestible public good) and their decentralization through Pigouvian taxes. As such goods do not use land as input, the balance between amenity and land use cannot be discussed. Berliant et al. (2006) endogenize the public good provision and location in cities where households have inelastic land use. Optimal public good providers are found again to be equidistant and to serve basins of residents of the same size. Yet, in contrast to this paper, those studies are conducted under the assumption of no land use in the production of local public goods and/or no choice for residential land plots. Because urban green areas are rather land-intensive, it is important to study how land use affects public goods. Furthermore, the distribution of residents is not uniform across urban landscapes and not exogenous to the local amenities given by urban green areas. This paper focuses on the relationships between the optimal distribution of residents and green areas.====Finally, this paper links to the urban economics literature regarding the effect of open spaces on urban form. Wu and Plantinga (2003) investigate the effect of an open space on the surrounding urban structure. They, however, treat the location and size of this open space as exogenous. Warziniack (2010) considers voting on the location of a single open space when the geographical distribution of households is exogenous. Lee and Fujita (1997) and Yang and Fujita (1983) examine the effect of a greenbelt, which has an exogenous location. Yang and Fujita (1983) consider the effect of open spaces at the neighborhood level and conclude that the equilibrium open space provision is uniform across the distance to the city center. Such results contrast with our empirical analysis that shows that the share of urban green areas is not constant across the city space. Our model with optimal locations and choices of residential space enables an explanation of this pattern.====Parallel to our question is the issue of unoccupied urban spaces, which are often seen as green areas. In contrast to urban green areas, open spaces are not maintained for human activities. Unoccupied land has been primarily justified by the leapfrogging effect. Capozza and Helsley (1990) and followers explain this effect by the commitment of building decisions and the resulting option value of urban land. Turner (2005) explains unoccupied land by the negative externalities of dwellings in their direct neighborhoods. Walsh (2007) discusses and estimates the protection and regulation of open spaces in Wake County (North Carolina, USA), which expands the discussion beyond monocentric city frameworks. Caruso et al. (2007) simulate market equilibria with discrete house plots and a fixed housing consumption, which lead to open spaces. In contrast, our paper discusses a continuous model where households decide their locations and plot sizes and where open green areas are costly and planned as in many EU cities. Urban green areas, such as parks or trees planted in rows, have maintenance and land opportunity costs that are incurred by society. Finally, Wu and Irwin (2008) study the dynamic land development around a lake that provides a global and congestible amenity. By contrast, this paper discusses a land intensive amenity that scatters across the space, provides local public goods and is chosen by a planner.====The organization of this paper is as follows: Section 2 presents the theoretical model and discusses the socially optimal allocation of urban green areas and the decentralization through the land market. Section 3 is devoted to our empirical approach and results. We first provide evidence on the single-peaked shape of the share of urban green areas. The last section concludes the paper.",Small urban green areas,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069621000012,18 January 2021,2021,Research Article,183.0

In its multispecies fishery, even a mild positive correlation between stocks can result in a substantial reduction in effort limits if overfishing is to be avoided.","The precautionary principle, or precautionary approach, has become increasingly accepted in recent decades as a general framework of environmental policy, law, and management. It is conceived as a way to ensure that decision-makers take into account uncertain but potentially serious and/or irreversible threats. The principle originated in Germany in the early 1980s. It gained international recognition in 1992 when it was integrated into the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development as part of a broad framework for sustainable development (Peel 2005),==== and when it was also incorporated into the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the UN Convention on Biological Diversity. More recently, the Conference of the Parties of the Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD) confirmed the key role of the precautionary principle in the Cartagena Protocol of Biosafety concerning transfer, handling and use of living modified organisms from modern biotechnology (European Commission 2000).==== Since then, the precautionary approach has consolidated its role in multilateral agreements, international law, and domestic policies (Peterson 2006). It is presently applied throughout the world to guide environmental policy in areas as diverse as climate change, marine fisheries, invasive species, food standards, transport of hazardous waste, and chemicals regulation.====In this paper we explore the implementation of environmental policy when precautionary buffers are mandated by law, treaty or agreement. In practice, such precautionary buffers are usually specified by performance standards to be attained with a given probability. In the management of multispecies fisheries the objective of the manager is to maximize industry profits while keeping the probability of overharvesting below a regulatory threshold – fifty-percent for U.S. fisheries governed by the Magnuson-Stevens Act. In regulating air pollution U.S. Primary National Ambient Air Quality Standards specify attainment for three criteria pollutants, SO====, NO==== and PM====, in terms of the ====th percentile of 1-hour maximum concentrations, averaged over three years.==== Similarly, section 303(d) of the U.S. Clean Water Act requires individual states to list all impaired water bodies and develop Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) to determine the maximum amount of a specific pollutant that a waterbody can receive and still meet water quality standards (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.). These “TMDLs must account for seasonal variations in water quality, and include a margin of safety to account for uncertainty in predicting how well pollutant reductions will result in meeting water quality standards.”==== Thus, “instead of selecting the maximum load value as the daily load, it is advisable to select a value that represents a high percentile (e.g., 95th or 99th), but not the maximum, of the distribution to protect against the presence of anomalous outliers.”(EPA 2007, p.19). The implementation of phytosanitary policy to prevent the introduction of pests and diseases through trade relies on International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPM's). ISPM 31 provides guideance for phytosanitary inspection. It recognizes that inspection is subject to error and that implementation of phytosanitary measures require the establishment of standards for tolerance and confidence levels. “The confidence level indicates the probability that a consignment with a degree of infestation exceeding the level of detection will be detected. A confidence level of 95% is commonly used. The NPPO [National Plant Protection Organization] may choose to require different confidence levels depending on the intended use of the commodity. For example, a higher confidence level for detection may be required for commodities for planting than for commodities for consumption, and the confidence level may also vary with the strength of the phytosanitary measures applied and historical evidence of non-compliance.”(IPPC 2008, p.86) (Federal Register, 7AD).====In section 2, we model environmental policy when the governing regulatory systems involve the use of precautionary buffers and the decision-maker faces multivariate uncertainty. Our approach builds on Sklar's theorem (Sklar 1959) and the copula representation of multivariate distributions, which allows us to separately model and estimate the dependence structure and marginal distributions of random vectors. This provides a convenient way to compare policy design across correlated, independent, and separable risks. We frame the decision problem of a policy-maker as a chance-constrained optimization and use stochastic dependence orders to characterize how an optimal policy changes under alternative dependence structures. Stavins (1996) and more recently Kennedy and Barbier (2015), have argued that standard instrument recommendations (price vs. quantity instruments; see Weitzman 1974) may be inappropriate in the presence of simultaneous correlated uncertainty. As far as we know, however, ours is the first work to address general stochastic dependence across multiple environmental variables and its impact on precautionary policy buffers. The model provides useful insights in contexts involving interactions across natural resources or joint production of environmental pollutants and it may help inform environmental regulation more broadly.====The idea of precautionary resource utilization and management has been widely adopted in the context of marine conservation (Harwood and Stokes 2003; Cooney 2004). Uncertainty is pervasive in fisheries, and mismanagement can have serious long-term and potentially irreversible consequences because it may take decades for a stock to recover from over-fishing, and it will never recover if driven to zero. The 1995 UN Fish Stocks Agreement (FSA) is the first global fisheries agreement to mandate a precautionary approach to fisheries management (United Nations 1995). The 1995 Food and Agricultural Organization Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries likewise calls for integration of the precautionary approach in the conservation, management, and utilization of aquatic resources (FAO 1995). These measures have been highly influential in shaping fisheries management worldwide. In response, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) has provided precautionary guidance for fisheries managers since 1999 (Cooney 2004).==== ICES formalizes the precautionary principle through precautionary catch buffers designed to allow for uncertainty and ensure that each stock's biomass remains above the precautionary reference point with 95% probability (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2018).==== Similar approaches have been adopted in the United States (Federal Register October 18, 2016, Methot et al., 2014), Australia (Department of Agriculture and Water Resources 2018) and beyond (Sissenwine et al. 2014; Mace et al. 2014). Currently, precautionary buffers are set primarily at the single-species level (e.g. cod or haddock). Indeed, “reference points that are used throughout fisheries management, are based on single-species production functions that generally do not account for environmental and ecological interactions”(National Research Council 2014, p.5). There is an emerging effort by policymakers to broaden their scope and consider multispecies ecosystems (Fluharty 2005; Da Rocha, Gutiérrez and Cerviño 2012; Link 2018). This inherently requires dealing with stochastic dependence among fish stocks. In addition, there is a consensus among scientists that uncertainty surrounding marine ecosystems will grow in scope as climatic conditions change, (National Aquarium, 2014). This increasing uncertainty has led various authors to call for a renewed focus on precaution and adaptive fisheries management (Grafton 2010; Miller et al., 2010; Sumaila et al., 2011; Punt et al., 2014).====In subsequent sections of the paper we apply the theory developed in section 2 to examine the implications of precautionary buffers on fisheries management in the Gulf of Maine, one of the fastest-warming ocean ecosystems on the planet. We focus on the iconic multispecies cod and haddock fishery. When risks are correlated, the optimal policy to achieve the performance standard specified in the Magnuson-Stevens Act may be dramatically different from the sub-optimal choices that are usually made by assuming those risks are separable.

For instance, the question relates to the possibility of export promotion policies being environmentally beneficial. Thus, the issue is especially relevant for developing countries typically characterized by weak enforcement of environmental regulation. However, despite the extensive literature assessing the environmental consequences of aggregate trade, the evidence from firm-level trade is relatively scarce and skewed toward developed countries. Accordingly, we employ cross-sectional data across Indonesian firms to assess the causal effect of exporting on abatement behavior. Due to concerns over non-random selection into exporting, we also resort to a number of novel identification strategies. Two of the approaches are proposed by Millimet and Tchernis (2013) and entail either minimizing or correcting for selection bias. The remaining methods, attributable to Lewbel (2012) and Klein and Vella (2009), rely on higher moments of the data to obtain exclusion restrictions. While we largely find exporting to encourage pollution abatement, the estimated impacts are more pronounced after accounting for the endogeneity of exporting status.","Cherniwchan et al. (2017, p. 60) state: “A firm-level focus in answering trade and environment questions is very promising, but researchers have not yet fully exploited its potential.” Using data from Indonesia, our objective is to examine the environmental implications of plant-level trade.==== More specifically, we assess whether exporting facilities engage in more pollution abatement than non-exporters.====The question is crucial due to a number of reasons. First, if serving foreign markets encourages firms to abate, then export promotion policies may have environmental benefits.==== This is especially relevant for countries like Indonesia that have weak enforcement of environmental legislation. For example, García et al. (2007, p. 742–743) state: “Countries such as Indonesia face a tough challenge in choosing and designing policy instruments to deal with industrial pollution. Conventional regulation (such as requirements to use best available technology) is known to be grossly inefficient, since it provides no incentive for firms to innovate. Furthermore, the whole process of setting standards is easily manipulated by powerful industrial lobbies.” Second, although the environmental consequences of trade have been extensively analyzed using aggregate data, the evidence from firm-level studies is relatively scarce (e.g., Antweiler et al., 2001; Cole 2006; Cole and Elliott 2003; Chintrakarn and Millimet 2006; Frankel and Rose 2005; Kellenberg 2008; Managi et al., 2009; McAusland and Millimet 2013; Roy 2017; Tsurumi and Managi 2014). Moreover, as discussed below, the few studies based on disaggregate data are skewed toward developed countries. Finally, in keeping with contributions such as Kitzmueller and Shimshack (2012) and Chuang and Huang (2018), our topic relates to the increasingly important role of environmental protection as part of corporate social responsibility (CSR). According to Kitzmueller and Shimshack (2012, p. 79), “the international and especially developing country context is an interesting natural laboratory to explore CSR and its mechanisms.”====However, the effect of exporting on environmental expenses is not clear a priori. For instance, if environmental expenditures compromise establishments' international competitiveness, exporting may discourage abatement (e.g., Kaiser and Schulze 2003; Distelhorst and Locke 2018). As Distelhorst and Locke (2018, p. 697) note, “firms that observe higher standards - like offering higher wages or paying to mitigate their environmental impacts - are at a competitive disadvantage in export markets. This view rests on two assumptions. The first assumption is that, other things equal, observing higher labor and environmental standards results in increased unit prices …The second assumption is that customers (importers) are indifferent to the labor and environmental standards of their suppliers. They are unwilling to pay higher prices to do business with compliant exporters.” Alternatively, it is plausible that exporting raises plant-level productivity and thereby facilitates investment in abatement (e.g., Bernard et al., 2018; Forslid et al., 2018). Moreover, to the extent that exporting entails significant international monitoring perhaps due to the presence of environmentally conscious consumers, firms serving foreign markets may abate more (e.g., Cole et al., 2006; Distelhorst and Locke 2018). Again, Distelhorst and Locke (2018, p. 697) discuss how “[r]eputation-conscious importers may …prefer to do business with exporters that comply with minimum standards in labor and environmental practices.” Further, Christmann and Taylor (2001, p. 444–445) state: “An additional concern that might induce export-oriented firms in developing countries to pursue environmental self-regulation is the potential use of environmental regulations in developed countries as protective trade barriers. Firms can address this problem by meeting the highest environmental regulations prevailing in the largest export market.” In fact, they contend that “[f]or export-oriented firms in developing countries, the regulatory and market requirements of major export markets overshadow the regulatory influence of the home market.” Accordingly, whether exporters engage in greater pollution abatement is ultimately an empirical question.====That said, identifying the causal effect of exporting on firms' pollution abatement is challenging due to the potential endogeneity of exporting status attributable to two factors. First, a number of unobserved characteristics may influence plant-level environmental performance as well as exporting behavior. For example, credit constraints are likely correlated with establishments' exporting and environmental behavior (e.g., Andersen 2016; Aristei and Franco 2014; Evans and Gilpatric 2017; Fauceglia 2015). As discussed by Leonidou et al. (1998), Cole et al. (2008), and Bloom et al. (2010), among others, unobserved managerial quality may also have trade and environmental implications at the firm level. Similarly, political connections may influence firms' pollution discharges as well as exporting performance (Deng et al., 2020; Yasar 2013). Moreover, unobservables such as consumer preferences in overseas markets and plants' outsourcing and innovation behavior also qualify as potential confounders (Aghion et al., 2020; Brunel 2017; Cole et al. 2006, 2014). Second, reverse causation may be an issue since environmental reputation may influence firms' international operations (Martin-Tapia et al., 2008). Similarly, pollution abatement can raise a firm's profitability and thereby its propensity to export (e.g., Pang 2018; Wagner 2012). Although one can resort to an instrumental variable (IV) strategy to address the endogeneity of exports, the issue is exacerbated by the paucity of instruments. In other words, it is difficult to conceive of an exclusion restriction that is associated with plants' exporting behavior but not directly correlated with their abatement activities.====In this light, we employ cross-sectional data across Indonesian firms to examine the impact of exporting on pollution abatement. Due to concerns over endogeneity of exporting status, we rely on a number of novel approaches that help identify our causal effect of interest under certain assumptions. The first approach begins by adjusting for differences in observed characteristics across exporters and non-exporters, and subsequently estimating the causal effect of interest for a subset of observations where the endogeneity bias is minimized. The second method extends this strategy by correcting for the bias arising from non-random selection into exporting. While both of these approaches are attributable to Millimet and Tchernis (2013), the remaining (IV-based) methods follow from Lewbel (2012) and Klein and Vella (2009) and exploit higher moments of the data to obtain exclusion restrictions. Across two measures of pollution abatement costs, all our estimators find exporting to encourage pollution abatement behavior.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

We obtain daily data on air pollution at the more disaggregated, sub-national level from satellite data and station-based data. We combine these data with the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker, a unique database on government policy responsiveness to COVID-19. We supplement our analysis with data from other sources including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Google Community Mobility Reports, World Bank World Development Indicators, WHO Global Ambient Air Quality Database, and Economist Intelligence Unit.====The rich database that we assemble allows us to address a key challenge in cross-country analysis, which is to construct comparable lockdown dates for different countries. Indeed, the term ‘lockdown’ can refer to anything from mandatory quarantines to bans on events and gatherings, businesses closures, or non-mandatory stay-at-home recommendations. Some governments immediately respond to the outbreak by implementing a complete (regional or national) lockdown (e.g., China, Italy), while some implement a gradual lockdown in a staggering manner for different locations (e.g., the United States).====We find strong evidence for reduced air pollution after the lockdowns, with more reduction for a larger window of time around the lockdown dates. In particular, the global decreases in NO==== and PM==== hover around 5 percent and 4 percent using the optimal bandwidths of 62 and 88 days after the lockdowns, respectively. We perform various placebo tests and robustness tests using falsified lockdown dates, different indicators of air quality and government policy indexes, alternative bandwidth specifications, functional forms, and inclusion of different covariates.==== Our findings suggest that mobility restrictions following the lockdowns can be a channel that explains the improvement in air quality.",Does the COVID-19 lockdown improve global air quality?

A review of the literature reveals large variation both in the discount rate estimates coming from different stated preference surveys and in the specific empirical methodologies used to estimate discount rates. While most use similar theory and logic in deriving discount rate estimates, it remains an open question how much of the variation seen in the literature is due to differences in empirical methodology. Using a single data set, we estimate annual discount rates using six different methodologies, including endogenous and ex-post estimation techniques as well as a variety of parametric and nonparametric choice models. We find that most of our estimates are tightly clustered between 14.5 and 31% while one methodology yields an outlier value of 200%. We also use multiple metrics to determine which methodology yields the “right” discount rate and find that the methodology with the best “goodness-of-fit” using information statistics does not always yield the highest predictive accuracy. Our findings suggest that, while methods grounded in similar theory often produce comparable methods, caution and robustness checks are critical.","Stated preference discrete choice experiments (DCEs) are an analytical tool that can inform preference modelling, especially in areas where revealed preference data are unreliable, incomplete, or scarce. DCEs have been adopted broadly and are common practice in fields from marketing to environmental, health, and transportation economics. These methods are often used to inform public policy decisions, from infrastructure spending to environmental conservation and energy policy. A common feature of DCEs that is often left unexamined is the intertemporal nature of the stream of costs and benefits being posed to respondents. Several approaches have been developed that use respondent decisions to estimate individuals’ discount rates. Yet, the ability of these different techniques to deliver consistent and appropriate discount rate estimates across competing approaches remains an untested source of uncertainty that is likely to impact policy recommendations.====Typically, respondents are asked to consider paying a one-time or finitely repeated==== annual tax or fee in exchange for the establishment of some project that delivers a stream of future benefits to the respondent, such as planted forests that improve biodiversity (Yao et al., 2014), dune restoration that combats coastal erosion (Matthews et al., 2017) or riparian land restoration that increase recreational amenities (Holland and Johnston 2017). Understanding consumers’ intertemporal preferences is crucial to designing optimal policy, as the “best” policy can vary based on the discount rates of the affected population. More patient populations, with lower discount rates, will be more amenable to bearing immediate costs in exchange for more distant future benefits, while impatient, high discount rate populations are likely to prefer having these costs spread over time.====Despite a general tendency in the literature to gloss over intertemporal considerations in DCEs, there is a small but diverse literature that uses stated preference surveys to estimate discount rates. Diverse is an operative word, as these studies vary significantly in their context, in the methodologies they bring to bear when estimating a discount rate, and in the discount rates that they produce. This literature==== is notable in that there is no dominant technique that has emerged as the standard for estimating discount rates. Rather, multiple techniques have been used, and while these techniques are similar in their theoretical foundations, they are not identical.====While the use of competing discount rate estimation methodologies is pervasive, authors tend to adopt a single, consistent empirical methodology within a given study. As such, it is not possible to identify whether different methodologies are a source of significant variation in discount rate estimates and the aggressiveness of accompanying policy recommendations. The primary aim of this paper is to compare and examine critically a variety of methodologies used to estimate discount rates in the DCE literature. We use six different procedures to estimate discount rates for a single data set and find that estimates are, for the most part, relatively consistent, with annual discount rates in the 14.5–31% range. We find that ex post and endogenous estimation techniques (defined in the next section) yield nearly identical discount rate estimates if they are estimated from choice models with similar parametric assumptions. We likewise derive similar discount rate estimates from both parametric and nonparametric models, though our nonparametric models produce discount rates that are slightly lower. Our most sophisticated modelling procedure, which uses a mixed logit estimator with a lognormal distribution for the price coefficient, generates a substantially different discount rate of 200%. We also compare the “fit” of elicited discount rates using the Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) in addition to an in-sample prediction assessment. Surprisingly, the model with the outlier discount rate possesses the best fit for the data but performs the worst of all methodologies in predictive accuracy. While applied to a different context, this finding mirrors that of Klaiber and von Haefen (2019), who also document that models using random parameters can improve model fit but decrease predictive accuracy. It is likely that this outlier estimate is not due to increased model complexity per se, but rather the inclusion of complexity that leads to model misspecification. The variation in our estimated discount rates underscores the need for “Discount Rate Estimation Best Practices” to ensure that the policy recommendations drawn from DCEs are not influenced unnecessarily by major discrepancies among commonly accepted methodologies.",Estimating discount rates using referendum-style choice experiments: An analysis of multiple methodologies,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069620301224,27 November 2020,2020,Research Article,187.0

Under normal demand conditions, introducing additional renewable generation capacity reduces net demand. Consequently, the lockdown can provide insights about electricity market performance with a large share of renewables. We find that although the lockdown reduced average day-ahead prices in Italy by 45%, re-dispatch costs increased by 73%, both relative to the average of the same magnitude for the same period in previous years. We estimate a deep-learning model using data from 2017 to 2019 and find that predicted re-dispatch costs during the lockdown period are only 26% higher than the same period in previous years. We argue that the difference between actual and predicted lockdown period re-dispatch costs is the result of increased opportunities for suppliers with controllable units to exercise market power in the re-dispatch market in these persistently low net demand conditions. Our results imply that without grid investments and other technologies to manage low net demand conditions, an increased share of intermittent renewables is likely to increase the costs of maintaining a reliable grid.","The response of governments around the world to the COVID-19 pandemic has led to negative demand shocks to almost all industries, particularly those in the energy sector. Oilprices plummeted and the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures contract for delivery in May 2020 went negative on April 20 reflecting the exhaustion of local oil storage capacity (Borenstein, 2020). Industrial production has halted, shops and offices were closed, and electrified public transport operated at reduced service, all of which reduced the demand for electricity and affected its pattern across time and space.====In this paper, we explore the consequences of the particularly strict lockdown in Italy in the spring of 2020 on the performance of the country's wholesale electricity market. The lockdown significantly reduced the demand for controllable sources of electricity such as thermal generation units. These units serve ====—the difference between system demand and supply of non-controllable sources that include renewables such as wind, solar, non-storable hydro, and net imports.====Consequently, the negative COVID-19 electricity demand shock translates into a negative net demand shock because the supply of non-controllable sources were largely unchanged during the lockdown. Therefore, lockdowns and their associated low net demand realizations can provide insight into the challenges system operators may face as regions increase the share of intermittent renewables in their electricity supply industries. In this sense, the COVID-19 lockdown provides a unique opportunity to analyze potential weaknesses in current electricity market designs with a higher share of intermittent renewables envisioned by the climate policy goals of many countries around the world.====A back of envelope calculation reveals that the 20% decrease in business-as-usual (BAU) demand caused by the lockdown in Italy is the equivalent to a 2.3 times higher output from wind and solar energy at pre-COVID-19 demand levels.==== More than doubling the output from wind and solar may sound overly ambitious, but it is well within the targets for renewable energy production in many countries around the world.====Intermittent renewables such as wind and solar, are likely to concentrate their production within certain hours of the day, month, or year, which can significantly exacerbate the re-dispatch cost increase we identify.==== From an environmental perspective, the first-order effect of additional renewable capacity is that emissions will decrease because generation from thermal units will be displaced. However, the intermittent nature of many renewable technologies is likely to increase the importance of a second-order effect that causes a more inefficient operation of remaining thermal generation units because of more start-ups and faster ramps of these units (see e.g., Graf and Marcantonini, 2017; Kaffine et al., 2020). The cost of additional start-ups and faster ramps associated with responding to the rapid appearance and disappearance of wind and solar energy can scale rapidly with the amount of renewable energy.====A negative demand shock paired with lower input prices to produce electricity should lead to lower electricity prices. In Fig. 1, Panel (a), we show that average hourly day-ahead market electricity prices were down by 45% during the period of the lockdown compared to BAU levels. However, in simplified electricity market designs that do not account for intra-zonal transmission constraints and other relevant system security constraints in the day-ahead market that exist in virtually all European countries and most wholesale markets outside of the United States, a re-dispatch process is necessary to adjust day-ahead market schedules to ensure that they do not violate real-time transmission network and other system security constraints (see, e.g., Graf et al., 2020a, 2020b, for more details). Particularly in simplified electricity market designs without an effective local market power mitigation mechanism in place, this re-dispatch process is likely to become more costly as the share of intermittent renewable resources increases because more controllable generation units are likely to have their schedules adjusted in the re-dispatch process to achieve schedules that are compatible with a secure operation of the grid.====In Fig. 1, Panel (b), we show average hourly re-dispatch costs per MWh of demand up by 108% relative to the average for the same time period in previous years, what we call the BAU period.==== While the average BAU period re-dispatch costs per MWh of demand was about 18% of the average daily day-ahead market price, it increased to 71% of the average daily day-ahead market price during the lockdown. Furthermore, in the 20% highest re-dispatch cost days during the lockdown, the average re-dispatch cost per MWh of demand exceeded the average daily day-ahead market price.====The increase in re-dispatch costs during the lockdown has significantly reduced the cost savings to final consumers due to the day-ahead market price decrease from lower net demand during the lockdown. There are two major explanations for this result: First, this demand shock created additional opportunities, not available to suppliers outside of the lockdown period, to profit from the divergence between the network model used to clear the day-ahead market and network constraints necessary to operate the grid in real-time as discussed in Graf et al. (2020b).==== Second, this persistently low level of net demand is likely to require additional security constraints to be respected in operating the grid during a larger fraction of hours of the day.====To compute a BAU re-dispatch cost counter-factual that allows us to distinguish between these two determinants of increased re-dispatch costs, we estimate the relationship between hourly re-dispatch costs using historical data on system conditions (including net demand) from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2019. We use a deep-learning neural network model to predict BAU re-dispatch costs given system conditions during the lockdown period.====We find that predicted BAU hourly re-dispatch costs given system conditions for the lockdown period are only 26% higher than our BAU period re-dispatch costs. This counter-factual estimate of the increase in re-dispatch costs is approximately one-third of the 73% percent increase in the average hourly re-dispatch costs during the lockdown period relative to our BAU period re-dispatch costs. These two results suggest that there are likely to be new offer strategies that suppliers with controllable resources in their portfolio can employ to exercise unilateral market power during the persistently low (net) demand hours that occurred during the lockdown.==== However, we also recognize that some of this re-dispatch cost increase could have been driven by an increased number of operating constraints that must be respected during these persistent low-net demand conditions.====The result that a model estimated using data from 2017 to 2019 predicts re-dispatch costs during the lockdown period that are a fraction of re-dispatch costs during the lockdown is robust to a variety of different model specifications, including one that attempts to account for dynamic ramping constraints throughout the day faced by controllable thermal resources. We also use our BAU model to estimate how an increase in the amount of renewable energy would affect re-dispatch costs without the lockdown demand reduction. We find that doubling the output from renewable resources would increase re-dispatch costs by 37% during the pre-lockdown period of January 1, 2017 to March 7, 2020. This result reinforces our conclusion that re-dispatch costs are likely to increase significantly as a result of an increasing share of intermittent renewables at current demand levels.====Although the market response to an unexpected persistent net demand reduction caused by the COVID-19 lockdown is likely to be different from a more gradual net demand reduction caused by increased investments in wind and solar resources, our results demonstrate that without investments in transmission expansions and other technologies for managing low net demands as well as an effective local market power mitigation mechanism, the levels of re-dispatch costs could rise rapidly. At these low net demand levels many system stability constraints bind which can create new opportunities for suppliers providing these services to increase the prices they are paid.====These results also underscore the need for regions with ambitious wind and solar energy goals to adopt wholesale market designs that more closely match the economic model used to set prices and generation output levels to the way the transmission network is actually operated.==== Our results demonstrate that the opportunities for suppliers to profit from the difference between the model used to operate the electricity market and how the grid is actually operated scales rapidly as the average level of net demand falls.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the key features of structure and operation of Italian electricity supply industry necessary to understand our analysis. In Section 3, we show how the lockdown demand shock has affected market outcomes in the Italian electricity market. In Section 4, we detail our approach to estimating the pre-COVID-19 relationship between system conditions and re-dispatch costs that we subsequently use to predict counterfactual lockdown re-dispatch costs. In Section 5, we present our results and investigate their robustness under alternative modeling assumptions.

This is especially true for surface water given its fluid, fungible, and stochastic nature. Two quantifications have emerged: The prior appropriation doctrine provides absolute quantities to water allocated based on first use while proportional water rights distribute a set percentage of total water to owners. While theoretical differences have been identified, empirical tests are scarce due to the endogenous choice of water rights. I identify and utilize a natural experiment where ==== (Hispanic-rooted irrigation ditches) developed in Territorial New Mexico are later divided by the formation of Colorado, exogenously compelling that subset to be subject to the priority system while those in New Mexico continue to practice proportional division. Drawing on a broad compilation of archival, administrative, satellite, hydrological, and survey data, I find priority rights curtail investment for later irrigators, but that the marginal product of water is generally lower under that right system. This research advances our understanding of how distinct property right systems affect resource development and use. The results can guide stakeholders devising or reforming rights to a resource, particularly ones with stochastic flows.","Economists have long recognized that the development and allocation of natural resources are closely related to the underlying property right structure (Gordon, 1954; Coase, 1960; Demsetz, 1967; Alchian and Demsetz, 1973; Bromley, 1991). Better defined and enforced rights are expected to contribute to the economy by reducing externalities, spurring investment, and/or expanding markets (Alston et al., 1996; Besley and Ghatak, 2010; Hornbeck, 2010). Evidence of rent dissipation amidst incomplete rights exists for land (Anderson and Hill, 1975), timber (Mendelsohn, 1994), oil (Libecap and Wiggins, 1984), fisheries (Costello et al., 2008), wind (Kaffine and Worley, 2010), and water – both surface and ground (Rosegrant and Binswanger, 1994; Pfeiffer and Lin, 2012). Further attention has been given to the type of owner, finding that individual ownership is not always superior to communal or government ownership (Ostrom, 1990; Schlager and Ostrom, 1992; Sjaastad and Bromley, 1997). Less attention, however, has been given to implications of the particulars of how natural resources are measured and bounded within the property right system. The effects can be large, impacting the development and productivity of the resource, the transaction costs of trading the resource, and the proclivity for disputes over the resource (Libecap and Lueck, 2011).====Of the research examining how property right boundaries are defined for natural resources, surface water rights are perhaps the most studied. Because irrigation ditches are highly asset-specific (Bretsen and Hill, 2007), secure and predictable land rights (Alston and Smith, 2020) and water rights (Leonard and Libecap, 2019) are important to incentivize investment.==== Accordingly, many arid regions departed from the common-law riparian doctrine, which grants vague correlative, but not quantified, water rights to riparian land owners, and adopted one of two broad types of quantified water rights in its place: (1) Priority rights, where fixed amounts of water are allocated in turn based on an ordering (often based on time of first use); (2) Proportional rights, where the supply is allocated to users as a quantified share of the available total. Prior appropriation prevails in the arid portions of the United States, adopted in some form by the 17 western states. Other regions, such as Australia, Chile, China, and Mexico, employ proportional shares (Grafton and Horne, 2014; Rosegrant and Gazmuri, 1995; Chen et al., 2005).====The bounding of a stochastic flow as priority rights or as proportional shares has implications for investment and production choices. Most of the literature has set aside how the alternative systems impact development and investment to focus on the division of water and its impacts on production directly. Bennett’s et al. (2000) argue that efficient division of water depends on hydrological and economic conditions, but that percentage-based shares provide greater net-benefits compared to fixed priority amounts across many circumstances. The intuition is that priority rights often allocate the marginal unit of water to a single user experiencing diminishing productivity while more junior users, currently getting less or no water, could deploy that unit for a higher marginal gain. For a set number of similar irrigators, equal sharing – a specific proportional share –is the most efficient allocation (Burness and Quirk, 1979).====Comparisons across distinct water right systems have aided our understanding of how these property right systems correlate with development, production, and trade (e.g. Burness and Quirk, 1979; Howe et al., 1986; Howe and Goemans, 2003; Grafton et al., 2011). However, formal empirical testing of priority rights vis-à-vis proportional rights is challenging and scarce because their adoption, like other property rights, are endogenous to local factors that also impact outcomes (Demsetz, 1967; Carey and Sunding, 2001; Leonard and Libecap, 2019). I address the empirical challenge by drawing on the United States’ acquisition of the Southwest from Mexico in 1848 and the subsequent impacts on water rights as a natural experiment. Hispanic irrigators settled northern New Mexico with irrigation systems known as ==== A small subset was then administratively separated in 1861 when Colorado Territory was formed, leading to an exogenous change of water right systems.====My analysis draws on this border change to compare the development and performance of ==== in Taos County, New Mexico, where proportional sharing of water still persists, to that of ==== in Costilla County, Colorado, the adjacent county where priority water rights are enforced.==== These irrigation systems are but 50 miles apart and are similar besides the water right systems; they are gravity fed by snowmelt from the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, grow similar crops, share a cultural heritage, and, according to a recent analysis, have similar internal rules and practices (Cody, 2019). My analysis of these irrigation ditches provides novel empirical evidence on (1) how the distinct water right systems contribute to development and investment patterns, and (2) the marginal productivity of water in both systems for individual ditches and on average.====The empirical research closest to that pursued here is by Ji and Cobourn (2018), who also look at the implications of proportional sharing vis-à-vis priority rights. They utilize the fact that many irrigation districts are large and internally divide water on a proportional system to compare agriculture choices within irrigation districts to those outside who are subject only to the priority right system. They find irrigators within irrigation districts garner welfare gains through their ability to grow more water intensive and profitable crops. The empirical design provides credibility that the internal proportional shares cause these welfare improvements. Some questions remain, however, because irrigation districts are distinct as organizations in other ways (Bretsen and Hill, 2007; Smith, 2018; Ji and Cobourn, 2018) while their formation and borders are not random. By using the exogenous change in territorial borders, my study of the ditches in Taos and Costilla Counties isolates causal impacts of the water right structure on irrigation investment and performance for otherwise similar systems and irrigators. While the context allows for well identified causal estimates, it also necessitates consideration of external validity. In this regard, my analysis and Ji & Coburn’s (2018) complement one another by asking a similar question but drawing on different geographies, irrigators, sources of variation, and outcomes to answer it.====Given the water right systems in the empirical setting and available data, I specify six testable predictions that draw upon the intuition and small extensions of Burness & Quirks’s (1979) theoretical assessment of water rights. To test the predictions, I conduct two analyses based on two distinct and unique data sets. First, I draw upon irrigation enterprise census records from 1930, hand collected from the National Archives, to test for differential irrigation development and investment. Second, I utilize satellite imagery measuring the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to create a proxy for annual production from 1984 to 2011 and explore the marginal productivity of another unit of water across each water right system. Broadly, the priority system curtails investment, skewing the distribution towards senior water right holders. Meanwhile, the marginal productivity of water is typically higher, and uniformly so, within the proportional sharing system. These empirical results identify potential efficiency tradeoffs from reforming water right structures amid changing climates and demands. The insights can also extend to the development of property rights for other natural resources, especially stochastically supplied ones such as wind.====In the next section, I provide the intuition behind the testable predictions of the water right systems. Then I describe the empirical setting and natural experiment in greater detail in section 3. Next, I describe the data, methods, and results for the investment and production analyses in sections 4 Investment and capacity, 5 Water and production respectively. Finally, I conclude with a short discussion in section 6.",The relative economic merits of alternative water right systems,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069620301121,17 November 2020,2020,Research Article,189.0

Research in behavioral economics affirms that choices cannot be fully explained by stable preferences and behavioral biases but that the social environment affects agents’ decisions (Bowles, 1998; Postlewaite, 1998; Mailath and Postlewaite, 2010; Fehr and Hoff, 2011; Hoff and Stiglitz, 2016; Astier, 2018; Fatas et al., 2018). In addition, neuroeconomic studies support the role of social context in the formation of preferences (Fehr and Camerer, 2007; Mason et al., 2009; Engelmann and Hein, 2013).====In view of this, we develop a framework for the study of environmental and climate policies which explicitly recognizes that consumers’ preferences are shaped by interactions with social peers. This can contribute to better design of policies aimed at promoting or discouraging the consumption of goods or services whose utility depends on social interactions. For example, price instruments can achieve a desired long-term outcome by shifting a social norm towards the consumption of goods that are less damaging to the environment (Nyborg et al., 2006, 2016; Dasgupta et al., 2016). In this study, we focus on carbon taxation as a key policy aimed at reducing global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.====Carbon taxation, and more generally carbon pricing, increases the relative prices of goods and services with a carbon-intensive production cycle, thus encouraging a reduction in their consumption and a shift to low-carbon alternatives (Baranzini et al., 2017b; Cramton et al., 2017; Stiglitz et al., 2017). Existing economic studies analyze carbon pricing under the assumption that agents have fixed preferences and do not interact with others (e.g. Belfiori, 2017; Goulder et al., 2018; Hart, 2019). The purpose of our study is to examine carbon taxation when preferences are subject to social influence.====That visible behavior affects peers has been confirmed for various types of consumption decisions with considerable mitigation potential (Wynes and Nicholas, 2017), such as energy consumption (Allcott, 2011; Ferraro et al., 2011; Allcott and Rogers, 2014), adoption of renewable energy technologies (Ozaki, 2011; Bollinger and Gillingham, 2012; Inhoffen et al., 2019), and choice of transportation mode (Bamberg et al., 2007; Grinblatt et al., 2008; Abou-Zeid et al., 2013; Pike and Lubell, 2018). For instance, Allcott (2011) show that agents decrease their consumption of energy when they receive information about the consumption of similar neighbors. Studies by Bollinger and Gillingham (2012), Baranzini et al. (2017a) and Baranzini et al. (2018) find that agents are more likely to adopt solar panels if neighbors have already done so. Such local diffusion is driven by imitation of conspicuous consumption and communication of positive information about solar panels among neighbors.====Few studies have addressed carbon taxation with changing or even endogeneous preferences. Mattauch et al. (2018) analyze non-social endogenous preferences and climate policies. They consider the case of a carbon tax directly affecting the preferences of agents, through crowding-in or -out of intrinsic preferences by the monetary incentives (Bowles and Hwang, 2008). A study by van den Bijgaart (2018) finds that endogenous habit formation causes persistence in consumption choices. She shows that, as a result, the optimal externality tax should initially be higher than the standard Pigouvian one and gradually decrease over time. Finally, Ulph and Ulph (2018) study the role of conformity in consumption decisions under Pigouvian taxation. They find that the existence of a consumption norm weakens the effectiveness of the tax unless it succeeds to change the norm. As an addition to this literature, we model the influence of carbon taxation on preferences explicitly through social network effects, which comes down to combining public economics with social network theory.====Our results show that a carbon tax induces two types of effects. A first-order or immediate effect is a reduction in carbon-intensive consumption by an agent through the usual price effect. A second-order or subsequent effect is a change in preferences due to changes in consumption in the social network, leading to further changes in the consumption choices of agents through socially-embedded preferences. We explore different hypotheses concerning the mechanism of imitation between agents, i.e. perfect and imperfect imitation. We show that the endogenous formation of preferences in a social network can lead to the emergence of a ‘social multiplier’ of carbon taxation (Glaeser et al., 2003). As a result, due to imitation between agents, the tax elasticity of carbon-intensive consumption is higher than the instantaneous price elasticity. It is worth noting that in our model agents evolve towards a stronger taste for low-carbon goods because of an imitation mechanism and not as a result of increased altruism or concern for climate change.====We derive the Pigouvian and target-achieving taxes under socially-embedded preferences. The target-achieving approach determines the lowest carbon tax sufficient to meet a given GHG emissions reduction target, which does not necessarily emerge from a welfare maximization exercise. This approach resembles the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions within the 2015 Paris Agreement. We demonstrate that through network effects a policy objective can be reached with a lower tax. In other words, considering the social context in which preferences are formed allows reducing the effective carbon tax rate, which in turn can raise public and political support for it. We further quantify the social multiplier of carbon taxation by simulating the outcomes of a tax in a large network. Under realistic assumptions, social interactions multiply the effect of the tax by 1.3 which allows to reduce the effective tax by 38%. In addition, the social-network simulations makes possible an analysis of how core social characteristics, such as the strength of social influence in the formation of preferences, the distribution of tastes, the topology of the social network, and the distribution of income influence the effectiveness of a carbon tax. A precise description of the context in which social interactions happen, through network modelling, can deal with relevant contextual factors that affect the social multiplier and are bound to differ between regions and countries (Andor et al., 2020).====Our findings indicate that a population with high polarization of tastes experiences a lower social multiplier of taxation. The reason is that agents with a strong taste for either high- or low-carbon goods are less sensitive to social influence, leading to a lower tax effect on consumption. Such polarization is more likely to happen when social influence plays a strong role in the formation of preferences. We further show that increasing the strength of social influence does not always raise the social multiplier. Finally, income distribution and network topology have a small impact on tax effectiveness when social influence is weak. However, when social interactions play a strong role in consumption decisions, asymmetry in degree distribution of the social network and income inequality can produce polarization by creating clusters of agents with similar tastes that weaken the effectiveness of carbon taxation.====Our results mean that if consumption decisions depend on social interactions, the design of environmental and climate policies should account for these. Moreover, the contextual social factors allow for defining additional instruments, such as information and network policies, which can reinforce the social multiplier and hence the effectiveness of the basic regulatory policy.====The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the model of carbon taxation and socially-embedded preferences in the context of high- and low-carbon consumption. Section 3 derives the social multiplier of the carbon tax and the optimality conditions for Pigouvian and target-achieving taxation approaches. Section 4 presents numerical simulations to analyze the sensitivity of the social multiplier to the strength of social influence, initial taste distribution, network topology, and income distribution. Section 5 concludes, discusses policy implications and suggests questions for further research.",The social multiplier of environmental policy: Application to carbon taxation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069620301194,15 November 2020,2020,Research Article,190.0

Motivated by the widespread availability of micro-data on fishing vessel locations, this paper examines the complexity associated with the choice of the spatial scale in a DCM of fishing locations. Our empirical approach estimates the standard DCM at varying spatial resolutions using both simulated data and vessel monitoring system data from the Gulf of Mexico longline fishery. We assess model performance using goodness-of-fit, predictive capacity, parameter estimates, and the assessment of the fishery response to a hypothetical marine protected area. Results show that, even when the specification of the decision-making process is correct, models can be structurally biased because of the aggregation of spatial scale that neglects the value of many fishing locations. The extent of such biases can only be detected by considering various spatial aggregation levels.","Understanding and anticipating fishers’ spatial behavior is a critical component in the design and assessment of fishery management (Lewison et al., 2015; Smith, 2010; Valcic, 2009). Research on predicting how management measures impact the choice of fishing locations is dominated by discrete choice models (DCM), which are well-suited to the fishery setting where the resource distribution is often patchy (Sanchirico and Wilen, 1999). Although DCM provide a powerful framework for modeling spatial and temporal fishing behavior (Smith, 2010), the reliability of DCM results hinges in part on the definition of the choice set, as analyses are often limited by data availability (Huang and Smith, 2014; Smith, 2005).====Issues associated with ill-defined choice sets are neither new nor unique to fisheries economics (Manski, 1977; McFadden, 1978). Most research has focused on the issue of what to include in the consideration set – the subset of the choice set which includes only the alternatives considered by the decision-maker - and how to estimate it in a consistent manner. For example, the marketing and transportation literature has extensively investigated the heuristics of consideration sets since the 1970s (Hauser, 2014; Horowitz and Louviere, 1995; Narayana and Markin, 1975; Prato, 2009). In the 1990s, a number of important papers in recreation demand and environmental economics demonstrated the impact of choice set specification on welfare outcomes - and thus on policy analyses - and showed that the sign and magnitude of welfare biases is not necessarily systematic and can be ambiguous (Parsons et al., 2000; Parsons and Hauber, 1998; Peters et al., 1995).====Over the last decade, the spatial resolution of data capturing fishing behavior has dramatically improved with the deployment of geolocation technologies, such as vessel monitoring systems (VMS). The recent availability of vessel position data with high spatial resolution (better than 10 m accuracy) is a remarkable advance over traditional data aggregated into large statistical areas. In many fisheries, VMS transponders placed on each vessel track vessel positions at certain specified time intervals (e.g., each hour). These new data open up possibilities to refine analyses of fisher behavior across space and time. With potentially millions of recorded locations for each vessel, VMS data allow researchers to relax some prior assumptions underlying many DCM regarding the data-generating process and spatial scale of the analysis. In particular, it allows relaxing the implicit assumption of studies constrained by coarse spatial data that the decision-making process generating the data operates at that coarse scale. VMS data allow a more refined discretization of space permitting us to investigate the implications for the performance of classical DCM of the aggregation process related to partitioning space in different manners.====Through a novel approach that combines both simulated and real data, this paper investigates the following questions. First, how do estimates of traditional DCM of spatial behavior change as the mismatch between the spatial scale of aggregation and the spatial scale of the data-generating process grows? Second, how do estimates at spatially-refined resolutions depend on the spatial distribution and heterogeneity of the observations?====Spatial aggregation impacts DCM’s estimation through two main mechanisms. On the one hand, it affects the structure of the choice set. Aggregation determines what and how many choices are available in the decision-making sequence and it determines where an observed choice is located in space. Further, whether to change location in any period is a function of the opportunities available in the consideration set, which are modified by the level of spatial aggregation. On the other hand, aggregation affects the quantity and quality of the information used to estimate a DCM. Indeed, the opportunities in the different sites are assessed with the aggregated data (e.g., expected catches) and therefore the aggregation will affect the amount of information available to make those calculations, in particular by levelling out some data variability. For example, a fisher’s expected catch for each site in the choice set is the result of a complex process that likely combines individual and fleet-level observations for that site over some prior period of time.==== The impacts of spatial aggregation on the modeling of this process, however, is not immediately clear and will likely depend on the underlying heterogeneity of the data across both space and time. Fig. 1 illustrates the effects of spatial resolution where the color value of each tile (the aggregated unit of analysis) results from a weighted average of the colors associated with each individual observation. Depending on the interplay between the spatial distribution of the data, its spatial heterogeneity and the partition of space that is considered, the outcome at the aggregated spatial level can differ dramatically.====We conduct a series of Monte Carlo experiments (two sets of 600 in total) mimicking data from a commercial fishery. In addition to allowing us to control for the decision-making process of fishers – thus be free from misspecification issues – the simulations enable us to control for the level of spatial heterogeneity of data by considering different spatial concentrations of observations. Each experiment consists in estimating, at varying resolutions, the true decision-making process of three datasets of observations having different spatial distributions. We consider spatial choice sets defined at both higher and lower resolutions than the resolution of the true decision-making process, and without necessarily a nested structure (see Figure C.a in the appendix). This enables us to identify more precisely the respective effects of the two aggregation mechanisms we described.====For each combination of dataset and spatial resolution, we assess how well the estimated model can recover the true parameters of the decision-making process, how well the model fits the data, and how well it can predict unobserved choices out-of-sample. We also use the model to evaluate the welfare impact of the implementation of a hypothetical Marine Protected Area (MPA) because DCM have been a popular tool to conduct the impact analysis of an MPA policy (Curtis and Hicks, 2000; Hicks and Schnier, 2010; Hynes et al., 2016; van der Lee et al., 2014). We then apply the same analytical framework to a real case study using a unique dataset on bottom longline (BLL) fishing in the Gulf of Mexico reef fish (GoMRF) fishery that includes recently available geospatial data.====Our work contributes to the literature in two ways. First, our Monte Carlo experiments provide new insight into the effects of both spatial heterogeneity and spatial aggregation on DCM. Monte Carlo experiments have been used to assess the effects of varying the choice set generation process (Bierlaire et al., 2010; Li et al., 2015; Pramono and Oppewal, 2012; Stafford, 2018; Torres et al., 2011) and to validate the prediction capabilities of DCM (Haynie, 2005; Smith et al., 2014), but never to assess the sensitivity of the model to either the spatial heterogeneity of data or the partition of space. Second, we investigate the issue of the spatial scale of analysis in the context of VMS data utilization for DCM estimation. VMS data have been used in the context of discrete-choice modeling to refine the spatial identification of fishing sites or fishing operations (Hynes et al., 2016; Rijnsdorp et al., 2011; Russo et al., 2015) but never to explicitly address the relationship between the spatial scale of decisions and the spatial scale of analysis.====We find that even when the decision-making process is correctly specified, DCM can be biased because of the aggregation of data, and that these effects are amplified as spatial heterogeneity of a site’s quality increases. In contrast, we are not able to detect any effect of the spatial irregularity of the observation sample. Second, we demonstrate how VMS data can be used to detect model bias and to assess the robustness of DCM results. Our findings suggest caution in the use of DCM for policy analysis, when the researcher is unable to verify the robustness of their results across multiple spatial resolutions (e.g., due to data limitations).====In the remainder of the paper, we first describe our methodological approach, detailing the setting of the Monte Carlo experiments and the empirical data. We then show the results of the model estimations with the simulated data and with observations from the bottom long-line (BLL) sector of the Gulf of Mexico reef fish fisheries (GoMRF). Finally, we summarize our findings, draw general conclusions about spatial models and the use of VMS data, and suggest possible future research in this area.",Scale-dependency in discrete choice models: A fishery application,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009506962030111X,6 November 2020,2020,Research Article,191.0

Theoretical and simulation models have shown that updating allowance allocations based on firm emissions or output can improve the efficiency of the scheme by acting as a production subsidy. Using the U.S. NOx Budget Program as a case study, this analysis tests whether electricity generators in states which chose an updating allocation increase their electricity production relative to plants in states that chose a fixed allocation. ==== results provide evidence that updating allocations lead to an increase in generation for natural gas combined cycle generators, but not for coal generators. This effect is concentrated in low-demand overnight hours and varies both by the local mixture of coal and NGCC generators and by percentile. These findings imply that an updating allocation confers a modest but meaningful subsidy to production relative to a fixed allocation and that firm responses are heterogeneous based on production technology and market conditions.","The distributional impacts of tradable permit schemes are an increasingly important part of any political debate over new environmental regulations. Past research has shown that the allocation method for permits is one way to improve the efficiency and alter the incidence of the regulation Goulder et al. (1999); Fullerton and Metcalf (2001). Permits are often given away freely to regulated firms to meet distributional goals, including to offset costs to regulated firms in hopes of gaining their support for the policy. However, updating that allocation at regular time intervals to reflect each firm's relative share of output (or inputs) has been shown in theoretical and simulation models to be more efficient than a fixed allocation method in some second-best settings. Policymakers have started to widely consider alternatives to grandfathering. The European Union's Emission Trading Scheme and California emissions trading system both use an updating allocation for some emitters, Maryland has used an updating allocation for its Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) allowances, and Virginia is proposing to do so for its entrance to RGGI.====We use the NOx Budget Program (NBP) to econometrically investigate the effect of updating allocations on electricity generators. The effectiveness of updating allocations is particularly interesting to explore given the current movement towards regional cap-and-trade systems which may be particularly vulnerable to leakage or market power.====By “updating allocations”, we mean that a firm is granted free allowances under a cap-and-trade system, and that the firm's allocation depends on its economic activity during the policy period. For example, a firm may be allocated a share of allowances proportional to its share of production. This is in contrast to grandfathering, in which a firms' allocation is based on pre-period activity. Updating allocations acts as a production subsidy if allocations are based on production (or on other related activities) because increasing current production will result in a valuable increased future allocation.====Our results provide evidence that the production subsidy inherent in an updating allocation increases natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) generators’ capacity factor (utilization rate) relative to the fixed allocation. The production subsidy inherent in an updating allocation is larger than the cost of the emissions cap for NGCC plants. Coal plants, with higher emissions rates, see a small decrease in capacity factor. For coal plants, the production subsidy is not enough to completely offset the impact of the emissions cap. These effects are largest overnight, when electricity demand is lower. A back-of-the-envelope calculation finds that the effects are able to substantially mitigate emissions leakage, but only from low-emissions NGCC generators.====A large literature analyses production decisions in electricity generation. Coal and gas plants respond to variation in fuel prices, and an increase in the price of either fuel (coal or gas) causes substitution to the other Linn and Muehlenbachs (2018); Cullen and Mansur (2017). When electricity generators are subject to an emissions price, they reduce their emissions level Stavins (1998); Murray and Maniloff (2015). However, a number of papers find that regional emissions prices can result in leakage, where reduction in emissions in the regulated area are offset by increases in the unregulated areas Wing and Kolodziej (2009); Fowlie (2009); Burtraw et al. (2015); Aichele and Felbermayr (2015); Višković et al. (2017); Palmer et al. (2017); Fell and Maniloff (2018). Carley (2011) argues that cooperation between states to harmonize their cap-and-trade systems can help mitigate leakage. However, there is little econometric evidence on the effectiveness of policies to address leakage in the electricity sector.====Additional work has shown that updating allocation mechanisms can improve welfare when cap-and-trade programs are implemented in second best settings. Updating allocation has been proposed to mitigate concerns about emissions leakage Fischer and Fox (2012), market power Gersbach and Requate (2004), trade and tax interaction effects Fischer and Fox (2007), or uncertainty Meunier et al. (2018). Updating allocation acts as a production subsidy, which can address concerns about both leakage and market power Burtraw et al. (2015); Palmer et al. (2017). In some cases, updating allocation may actually lead to negative leakage Burtraw et al. (2015). Fowlie et al. (2016) conduct a counterfactual simulation of an updating policy based on a structural econometric model, finding that updating allocations could address a cap-and-trade program's interactions with the market power concerns identified in Ryan (2012).====Simulation work suggests that the effect of updating allocation will vary by generation type. Updating allocation increases the allowance price. Relatively low-emissions source (like NGCC generators) will have an emissions rate that is less than the subsidy, while a high-emissions source (like coal generators) will have an emissions rate greater than the subsidy. The net effect will be a subsidy for the clean NGCC generators and a cost for the dirty coal generators, and the net cost for coal generators may exceed the cost under grandfathering allocation because of the increase in allowance prices. We should thus expect updating allocation to increase generation from NGCC generators, but the effect on coal generators is ambiguous. Burtraw et al. (2015); Palmer et al. (2017).====There are other effects of updating allocations. Allowance prices will be above marginal abatement costs under updating allocation, which may distort policy analysts' and investors’ views about marginal abatement costs Rosendahl (2008). Furthermore, updating allocations can reduce economic efficiency Burtraw et al. (2001); Rosendahl (2008), although this is not necessarily the case on the supply side Böhringer and Lange (2005). Updating allocations will also in general reduce electricity prices relative to other allocation methods Burtraw et al. (2001); Neuhoff et al. (2006), which reduces incentives for demand-side consumption reductions and increases the overall cost of emissions reductions.====While the theoretical literature is promising in some cases, the econometric literature on updating allocation mechanisms is quite sparse. Branger et al. (2015) find that cement plants respond to a step-wise allocation system by bunching just above production levels required to receive larger allocations. In a working paper, Fowlie (2010a) also uses the variation in allocation mechanism in the NBP as its testing ground. The outcome tested is whether a plant's decision to re-start after being shutdown is affected by the emissions regulation and the production subsidy. Fowlie (2010a) finds that the emissions restrictions lead to longer shutdown times, however the impact of the production subsidy is not consistently statistically different than zero.====We make two distinct contributions with this study. First, we provide econometric evidence that plants responded to the implicit price subsidy inherent in an updating allocation. Second, we provide evidence that low emissions intensity producers respond more to an updating allocation mechanism than high emissions intensity producers.====These results are instructive for policymakers planning the set-up of a tradable permit scheme. They reveal the magnitude of the production subsidy inherent in an updating allocation; small but substantial enough to see increases in production. Importantly, the results also provide information about the type of plant that changes production and when these changes occur. Plants with higher emissions intensity have their response to the production subsidy muted by the emissions restrictions. The biggest decline for high emissions intensity plants tend to occur in off-peak hours when there is spare generation capacity.====There is an important caveat to our research design. While a large literature uses difference-in-difference identification strategies to study the electricity sector Fabrizio et al. (2007); Hausman (2014); Cicala (2015); Fell and Kaffine (2017); Fell and Maniloff (2018); Linn and Muehlenbachs (2018), this approach is vulnerable to treatment spillovers. Consider a state under the NBP that uses grandfathering allocation. Generators in the state face an increase in costs and will reduce generation. Out-of-state generators may increase generation to meet demand Fell and Maniloff (2018). While the literature typically assumes that such spillovers are very small, if this assumption is mistaken then estimated treatment effects will be biased. In this case, treatment effects would be biased away from zero - generation will decrease in treated states and increase in control states, so the difference between the two will be an overestimate of the true effect. Thus non-zero treatment effect estimates can be interpreted as evidence of a program effect (causing a change in generation in both the treatment and control regions), but cannot be interpreted as causal magnitudes. Similar logic holds for states which use updating allocations - the updating effect is biased away from zero.====We provide evidence that any bias from spillovers between NBP and control states or spillovers between updating and grandfathering states is modest. First we drop control states which are near the NBP region and thus most vulnerable to treatment spillovers. Results are similar, suggesting that any bias from spillovers to control states is small. Then we separately estimate the effect of the NBP on generation in grandfathering states omitting updating states, and in updating states omitting grandfathering states. Our estimates in grandfathering states are similar to our core estimates, and our estimates in updating states are similar to the sum of our core estimates of the NBP cost and subsidy effects. These results suggest that the bias created by spillovers from updating to grandfathering states is small. Finally, we consider Fell and Maniloff (2018)'s estimate of spillovers (referred to as “leakage” in that paper) as and calculate a plausible upper bound of 50% bias.====The next section provides background on the NBP and how power plants can comply with the regulation.

The provision of social information could, for instance, take the form of appeals to pro-social preferences or provision of social comparisons, including normative messages. For example, in Allcott (2011), consumers were sent letters comparing their electricity use to that of their neighbors and were categorized based on the social approval of their actions; an average treatment effect of 2 percent was found. Similar effects were found in both Costa and Kahn (2013) and Ayres et al. (2013). In the water domain, Ferraro and Price (2013) show that, while pro-social messages decrease water use by nearly 3 percent, average treatment effects are larger when households are provided with normative messages (4.8 percent). There is also evidence that these types of interventions result in persistent changes in behavior, even after the treatment has ended. This suggests that cost-effectiveness assessments have underestimated the economic benefits of these programs (Allcott and Rogers, 2014; Bernedo et al., 2014).====Given that social information does affect behavior and consumption choices for a particular good, an interesting question is whether this provision of information spills over to other consumption decisions. In this paper, we investigate whether an information campaign aimed at encouraging residential water savings had spillover effects on electricity use. In 2013, we conducted a randomized field experiment in a Colombian town. We provided monthly consumption reports including normative messages to a treatment group for one year. The average household targeted by the campaign decreased its water use by 6.8 percent (Jaime and Carlsson, 2018). During the same time period, we collected electricity use data in the same households. The goal was to ascertain whether the water-savings information campaign not only had an effect on water use, but also had a spillover effect on electricity use.====The study of behavioral spillovers across domains is important for a number of reasons. First, it contributes to the growing yet emerging discussion on unintended effects of social information campaigns. Second, it brings new insights to the literature on environmental psychology, which lacks conclusive evidence regarding the presence and direction of spillover effects in prosocial behavior (Stern, 2011). Because the campaign in Jaime and Carlsson (2018) was designed to evaluate the effect of information provision on both water and electricity use, it offers an appropriate set up not only to evaluate the presence of behavioral spillovers but also to disentangle the underlying characteristics that may affect households’ behavior. As far as we know, our study is the first natural field experiment that investigates spillover effects of a social information campaign.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss behavioral spillovers across consumption domains and, in Section 3, we present the basics of the experimental design. In Section 4, we present the empirical strategy.

There are parameter values for which quantity-based injunctive policies raise welfare relative to no intervention while optimal ==== would lower welfare.","In this paper we contribute to the growing literature on the design of environmental policy when the behaviour of individuals is driven not by self-regarding preferences but by a recognition that they are part of a wider society – a recognition that can shape their behaviour in a number of different ways.==== In particular we set out a model for exploring the policy implications of assuming that individual consumption is determined not just by the standard flow of utility from own consumption but also by a desire to conform with the consumption decisions of other individuals – that is to adhere to some norm level of consumption. In contrast with the standard analysis of Veblen effects which produces over-consumption,==== a desire for conformity implies that while some individuals may adhere to a consumption norm by raising their consumption, others will cut it. As in Dasgupta et al. (2016) we assume that structure of preferences is such that, if a consumption norm exists, there will be a set of individuals of positive measure that will adhere exactly to the norm level of consumption.==== It is this clumping of behaviour that in our view identifies the presence of a norm as distinct from just a more concentrated distribution of preferences.====However we extend the analysis in the previous paper by examining more systematically the conditions under which a norm level of consumption might exist and whether there could be equilibria in which more than one such norm level could co-exist.==== In doing so we draw on another idea in behavioural economics – that of threshold behaviour – by assuming that individuals will only adhere to a norm if enough other people do so.====These two features of our model have important consequences. The clumping of consumption means that there will be many individuals who will not change their behaviour unless there is a change in the norm level of consumption, while the threshold effect, combined with clumping, means that it may be very hard to shift the norm level of consumption.====This has some striking implications for environmental policy in the case where the norm good generates damaging emissions. For now there are two externalities – the environmental externality and that generated by the desire to conform to the consumption decisions of others. Taken on its own we know that the environmental externality can be addressed by a variety of policies, particularly Pigovian tax policies that confront individuals with the social costs of their actions and so induces an efficient degree of mitigation whereby every individual reduces consumption of the polluting good by an amount that balances off the social harm with their individual attachment to the commodity. For this reason economists typically do not favour injunctive quantity-based policies that impose outright bans or uniform limits on the consumption of harmful commodities.==== However, as we will show, the presence of conformity considerations significantly affects the relative effectiveness and desirability of different forms of environmental policy, because, for the reasons explained above price-based policies may not cause consumers to reduce their consumption of the polluting good. In particular we show that: (i) the conventional optimum Pigovian tax (equal to marginal damage) may be ineffective in changing demand for the polluting good; (ii) while it is sometimes optimal to impose the conventional Pigovian tax equal to marginal damage, in other circumstances the optimal tax can be zero, or greater than marginal damage; (iii) in some circumstances an injunctive quantity-based policy may be preferable to a Pigovian tax.====The structure of the paper is as follows. In the next Section we give a brief summary of the extensive literature on norms and threshold behaviour, explaining more fully how our framework contributes and adds to it. In Section 3 we set out our model of consumption norms and analyse its implications for individual behaviour. In section 4 we determine what norms can emerge as stable equilibria.

We consider strategic behaviour to arise when an agent: (i) believes the choice experiment will be used to determine a provision decision over a discrete set of alternatives; and (ii) has expectations about the relative likelihood of those alternatives being selected and delivered. In the experiment, agents receive induced values for the discrete set of provisioning alternatives. In treatments where agents receive information that their first best outcome is unlikely to win, we investigate the extent to which their choices change, in a manner consistent with them seeking to deliver their second best outcome in the provisioning decision. We find that 27% of respondents misrepresent their preferences and reveal evidence of strategic bias. We find that this behaviour is sufficient to change inferences about preferred provision at the aggregate level.","Strategic bias has long been a concern in stated preference studies. The phenomenon occurs when an individual “deliberately misrepresents their preferences in order to influence the decision making process” (Bennett and Blamey, 2001). Most of the research regarding strategic bias has concerned the contingent valuation method, with very few studies exploring whether, and to what extent, the bias might manifest itself in discrete choice experiments (DCE).====The main objective of this study is to examine strategic bias in discrete choice experiments within a realistic representation of the end use of DCEs in a decision making process. We conduct an induced value laboratory choice experiment that exhibits essential characteristics of when strategic bias might occur in the field. First, respondents believe an agency is deciding on a provision decision (e.g. yes/no development; high/medium/low conservation); second, respondents' choices in the DCE are used in the provisioning decision; and finally, respondents anticipate that true preference revelation will lead to an unfavourable provision outcome. To address the first element, we present a set of possible provision outcomes to respondents. Additionally, we induce values for each of the outcomes, such that respondents know their preference ordering over the provision outcomes. To address the second, respondents are told that the DCE will be used to determine which provision outcome, and hence payoff, will occur. To address the final element, some respondents are given information on the likelihood of each of the provision outcomes being implemented. This final aspect reflects situations when individuals have expectations of the likely provision outcomes through, for example, media outlets, opinion polls, social networks, etc.====We compare choice behaviour between those respondents who do, and do not, receive information on the probabilities of the provision outcomes being implemented. We investigate the extent to which those who, in the expectation of an unfavourable outcome, target a non-demand revealing option and misrepresent their unconditional preferences in the DCE in order to deliver their second best outcome.====The final provision outcomes are each described in terms of attribute levels. Respondents are told that the survey will first be used to evaluate their likes and dislikes over the different attributes and then that information will be used to make a decision on which provision outcome they prefer. More formally, the DCE choice data are used to estimate marginal utilities for the attributes and calculate the choice probabilities for the predefined provision outcomes. The provision outcomes are not seen as a choice set within the DCE, in which case the task would revert to a simple referendum. As such, respondents need to establish and use attribute-based decision rules consistent with whichever provision outcome the respondent desires. The full set of DCE choice data are used to determine which provision outcome (and hence payoff) will be provided.====Our experimental set up creates a challenging task for respondents, yet one we believe has characteristics that allow for strategic behaviour found in the field. Despite the complex task, we find a significant portion of respondents misrepresent their preferences when faced with the likely implementation of an undesirable provision outcome. We find evidence of the use of lexicographic heuristics by those opting to misrepresent their preferences. Finally, we find that by misrepresenting their preferences agents were able to influence the provision outcome, such that an outcome more favourable to them is delivered.====In contingent valuation studies (e.g. Bohm (1972), Whittington et al. (1990), Wheeler and Damania (2001), Taylor et al. (2001)) there is mixed evidence regarding the impact of strategic behaviour. Motivation for strategic responses in this case, is driven by two types of reasoning. The first occurs if the respondent thinks that the good will be provided given substantial positive responses; however, in actuality they will be able to pay less than their stated amount or someone else will pay for the service (Whittington et al., 1990). In this case, respondents have incentive to overbid. The second reason is driven by a respondent's belief that the decision to provide the good has already been made and the survey is aimed to elicit at what price the good should be provided (Carson and Groves, 2007). In this consideration, a respondent has incentive to underbid. The contingent valuation framework is such that it is possible for respondents to bias their responses because it may be easy to discern the research agenda and implement a strategy in the open ended or dichotomous framework. Even when contingent valuation studies are set up as an advisory referenda, responses may not always be incentive compatible if a respondent believes that the survey will be inconsequential (Vossler and Watson, 2013; Carson et al., 2014).====One of the (many) factors that prompted the widespread adoption of DCEs was that the dominant stated preference method, contingent valuation, had some weaknesses which DCEs were argued to be less vulnerable to. These included the scope for protest bidding and strategic behaviour (Hanley et al., 2001). Bennett and Blamey (2001) argue there are two main reasons as to why the DCE framework mitigates the possibility of strategic responses. First, a choice experiment environment can hide the true purpose of the survey and by asking respondents to make trade-offs between multiple attributes suggests certain ambiguity regarding the optimal response strategy. Second, the repetitive nature of DCEs provide an environment that is difficult to be consistently strategic. Despite the claims put forth that DCEs are less susceptible to strategic behaviour than other valuation techniques, there has been little testing of these assertions.====Carson and Groves (2007) argue that the DCE structure violates the Gibbard-Sattherwaite necessary condition for incentive compatibility, by asking respondents multiple questions. A response to this shortcoming is to stress consequentiality, which Carson and Groves (2007) define as the agent caring about the outcome and believing that the results from the survey will influence the decision making process. Using homegrown and induced value experiments, previous literature has explored how to achieve incentive compatibility in DCEs (e.g. Collins and Vossler (2009), Taylor et al. (2010), Carson et al. (2015), Interis et al. (2016)).==== One approach in the literature has been to randomly select one choice set from the experimental design to be binding to achieve incentive compatibility. In the binding set, a respondent is asked to pay for the good/bundle once the outcome is determined by some provision rule (e.g. plurality or majority rule). While a useful mechanism to achieve incentive compatibility, this approach does not reflect how DCE data is used in practice. In practice, a single set from the experimental design would not be chosen randomly and the relative popularity of the constituent options used to determine the provision outcome. Our approach seeks to move the consideration of strategic bias closer to a more plausible use of DCE data, in which all choice data are aggregated, is used to inform the provision outcome.====This paper is structured as follows.

Previous research suggests that past decisions may influence current decisions because consumers compensate morally desirable and undesirable acts over time, and carbon taxes have been promoted as effective tools to reduce the ","We use a novel incentive-compatible experimental design involving an online supermarket to study interventions designed to reduce the carbon footprint of actual food choices. Our research is motivated by current concerns over the sustainability of current food consumption (e.g. Garnett, 2011; Grunert et al., 2014; McMichael et al., 2007). Carbon emissions from food choices are estimated to account for around 30% of total household greenhouse gas emission in developed economies, with supermarkets capturing a large share of food expenditures (e.g., Panzone et al., 2013). As a result, there is increasing recognition that an effective sustainability policy requires the direct involvement of consumers (Dietz et al., 2009; Vandenbergh and Steinemann, 2007), and that differing consumer choices in-store can lead to significant reductions in the carbon footprint of food baskets (Panzone et al., 2016). However, research on actual sustainable behaviour in supermarkets is limited, both in terms of assessing the sustainability of current food choices, and of designing persuasive instruments to motivate sustainable consumption. Our paper addresses this by testing whether the recall of past environmentally-friendly behaviour, and the use of a carbon tax are effective in reducing the carbon footprint of supermarket food shopping. To ensure incentive compatibility, consumers made real choices and actually received the goods they purchased.====Food choices are driven by a number of interconnected factors, such as price, taste, healthiness, and environmental impact (see, for instance, Dubois et al., 2014; Hoppert et al., 2012; Raghunathan et al., 2006). While preferences for all these attributes contribute to the decisions consumers make, the focus of this article is on the environmental impact of food choices, measured as their carbon footprint. Environmental preservation, for instance in the form of low-carbon food baskets, is a public good (Daube and Ulph, 2016): the damage caused to the environment by a consumer purchasing high-carbon foods affects him as well as other consumers who buy low-carbon options instead. The pursuit of a low-carbon diet may then require consumers to give up personal benefits (in the case of food choices, e.g., accept a less desired flavour, or pay a higher price) to the advantage of social benefits (higher environmental quality). This propensity to prioritise social over private outcomes correlates with an individual's engagement in activities that protect the environment (Jia et al., 2017), and green consumerism is generally considered an ethical way of shopping (Mazar and Zhong, 2010). Food consumption is also recurrent, so that consumers are called upon to manifest their morality repeatedly (e.g., in a weekly shopping trip): choices carrying environmental implications can be made within the same consumption episode (e.g. an initial choice between high-carbon meat or low-carbon meat substitutes, followed by the choice between organic or standard vegetables), as well as across episodes (e.g. purchasing high-carbon meat again this week, after having purchased it last week). This time dimension makes habitual consumption a relevant barrier to behaviour change (Warde, 2014), as some products may be purchased routinely, without paying attention to their impact on the environment. Finally, over time food choices may be influenced by behaviour in other consumption domains (e.g. purchasing low-carbon food in a supermarket after having saved water in the past week).====We experimentally investigate strategies that can encourage environmentally responsible behaviour in a simulated on-line supermarket.==== Focusing on the carbon footprint of the basket as the behavioural variable, our first manipulation is a nudge that tests whether reminding consumers of their recent pro-environmental behaviour motivates subsequent sustainable consumption. This manipulation also allows testing whether pro-environmental behaviour in another domain acts as a complement (they co-occur) or a substitute (one comes at the expense of the other) for sustainable consumption in supermarket shopping (e.g. Greenberg, 2014; Nauges and Wheeler, 2017). The study of pro-environmental behaviour in a single domain implicitly assumes that one observation of pro-environmental behaviour is sufficient to characterise the environmental preferences of an agent, because underlying preferences are stable and cognitive dissonance processes (Festinger, 1962) act to make behaviours consistent with underlying psychological states. For example, cognitive dissonance can explain compensatory behaviours in cases where individuals go into “moral debit” following an antisocial act, and react by doing something desirable: for instance, an initial attitude-behaviour inconsistency (e.g., overconsuming water despite caring for its conservation in Dickerson et al., 1992) may lead people to restore the positive link between environmental attitudes and behaviour (e.g. by shortening their shower) when this inconsistency is made salient. However, this personological model of morality fails to explain why over time individuals may alternate moral and immoral behaviours (Effron and Conway, 2015; Gino et al., 2016; Khan and Dhar, 2006; Mazar and Zhong, 2010; Miller and Effron, 2010). In particular, this approach does not explain instances of moral licensing where “desirable” (e.g. pro-social) acts motivate subsequent “undesirable” acts (Khan and Dhar, 2006; Mazar and Zhong, 2010): for example, a consumer may feel justified in buying a high-carbon meat product after purchasing organic fruit.====To allow for a more general representation of moral behaviour, Monin and Jordan (2009) present a dynamic model of self-regulation where morality is driven by the moral self-image of the agent: individuals use past moral behaviour to remove the concern of appearing uncaring in subsequent moral tasks (moral licensing, e.g. Mazar and Zhong, 2010; Mullen and Monin, 2016); while past immoral behaviour motivates individuals to make reparations in present choices (moral cleansing, e.g. Sachdeva et al., 2009). This approach views individuals as targeting a certain level of moral self-regard that they aim to achieve and maintain. In this view, when facing a moral dilemma individuals will engage in moral behaviour whenever the perceived moral self-worth accumulated through past choices is below a desired level; and may behave immorally when the perceived moral self-worth is above the desired level. To this extent, moral licensing or cleansing are special instances of self-regulation strategies that balance socially desirable and undesirable behaviours and are likely to occur to consumers experiencing conflicting consumption goals, e.g. hedonic pleasure and eating healthily (see, for instance, Dhar and Simonson, 1999; Fishbach and Dhar, 2005; Laran and Janiszewski, 2009; Mukhopadhyay et al., 2008). However, few studies have focused on pro-social goals, and these have produced evidence consistent with both moral licensing (Tiefenbeck et al., 2013) as well as consistency (Greenberg, 2014) across consumption domains.====The second manipulation explores the role of carbon taxation to drive sustainable low-carbon behaviour in supermarkets. Carbon taxes are often considered a key instrument to reduce global warming by increasing the cost of consumption-related greenhouse gas emissions (Boardman, 2008; Metcalf and Weisbach, 2009; Pearce, 1991). Previous work on carbon taxes indicates they potentially reduce total household emissions by up to 80% (Metcalf and Weisbach, 2009), particularly by reducing energy consumption (Brännlund and Nordström, 2004). In the particular context of food policy, interventions have focused on nutrient-based taxes, targeting alcohol (Panzone, 2012), sugar (Zizzo et al., 2016), or fat content (Papoutsi et al., 2015). A carbon tax mirrors nutrient-based interventions by taxing a constituent of food products with environmental instead of health implications. However, there is limited research on their impact on consumption (e.g. Briggs et al., 2016). Because green taxes are designed primarily to reduce externalities rather than raise revenues (Metcalf and Weisbach, 2009; Pearce, 1991), the carbon tax in the experiment is designed to ensure revenue-neutrality by returning earnings to consumers as income. Note that the carbon tax was announced to consumers, thus potentially sending a signal about the environmental quality of each product (Hilton et al., 2014).====We also test for the interaction of taxes and environmental recall, because we may expect price interventions to influence pro-environmental motivation (see Bowles and Polania-Reyes, 2012; Rode et al., 2015). Taxes can motivate consumers by signalling the importance of sustainability in the mind of the policymaker; or demotivate them by removing the ability to self-signal interest in pro-social behaviour (Bowles and Polania-Reyes, 2012; Gneezy et al., 2011). Testing this proposition specifically on grocery, Perino et al. (2014) show that subsidising sustainable products can indeed reduce their consumption.====The rest of the article is as follows. The next section discusses the simple model of moral self-regulation used to describe the consumer decision problem. This section also explains how the experimental treatments can be used to increase consistency in the purchase of low-carbon baskets. Section 3 describes the data collection method, which measures consumer supermarket behaviour and attitudes and beliefs concerning the environment over a two-week period as well as out-of-store pro-environmental behaviour between the two shopping occasions. Section 4 presents the results of the econometric analysis. Results indicate that both taxes and the requirement to recall previous environmental behaviours strongly influence behaviour with similar strength such that the behavioural intervention would have the same impact as a £70/tonne CO====e carbon tax. Section 5 discusses the implications of these results for policy and future research. Finally, Section 6 briefly concludes.",The impact of environmental recall and carbon taxation on the carbon footprint of supermarket shopping,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069617307088,5 July 2018,2018,Research Article,205.0

However, prior studies have mainly focused on the ==== climate–agriculture relationship, which inhibits our understanding of potential distributional heterogeneity in climate change effects. Although knowing how climate may affect mean agricultural outcomes are important, it is no less critical to examine potentially differential impacts of climate on lower and upper tails of the outcome distribution, particularly as agricultural outcomes are highly heterogeneous. Moreover, the existing literature also largely assumes time-invariance of the climate–agriculture relationship, which neglects the evolution of climate impacts on agriculture over time, even though studies have shown that the advances in management practices and agricultural technology such as plant breeding and agro-chemicals may considerably assist farmers in adapting to the changing climate (e.g., Howden et al., 2007; Ceccarelli et al., 2010).====The present study examines the reduced-form relationship between climate and crop yields by addressing the aforementioned research gaps. The analysis is based on the annual county-level data for weather variables as well as corn and soybean yields over 1948–2010 in the rainfed region of the United States (east to the 100th Meridian). Crop yields are chosen because they are a simple and direct measure of agricultural production with detailed historical data for many decades. We estimate a flexible, yet parsimonious, time-varying-coefficient panel-data quantile regression model which explicitly allows for (====) distributional heterogeneity in the effects of climate on yields at various quantiles, (====) temporal variation in the dependence of crop yields on weather, and (====) unobservable county-level confounders.====Unlike traditional regression models that focus on the first moment, quantile regression provides a complete description of the relationship between the distribution of outcome variable and its regressors. Since agricultural outcomes are highly heterogeneous across space, there remains much untapped benefit of examining the link between climate and agriculture via quantile analysis. Thus, contrary to previous studies, exemplified by Schlenker and Roberts (2009) who utilize fixed-effects panel data models to estimate climate change effects on the ==== crop yields via conditional-mean models, we focus on conditional ==== of the yield distribution that enable us to examine potential heterogeneity in the climate-yield relationship.====Borrowing from Baltagi and Griffin (1988), we allow parameters of the conditional quantile to vary with time, which enables us to investigate the evolution of sensitivity of crop yields to weather variation. This evolution reflects farmers' technological adaptability to the changing climate. Most existing studies of the climate-yield relationship estimate models with time-invariant coefficients, implicitly assuming that the relationship is fixed. Although Burke and Emerick (2016) investigate the potential of adaptation to climate change by utilizing an innovative long-difference approach, they still implicitly assume that the climate change impact on crop yields does not vary over time. In other words, they impose that the responsiveness of crop yield to climate is constant over time. Few exceptions include Mendelsohn et al. (2001), Lobell et al. (2014), and Barreca et al. (2016) who quantify changes in the sensitivity of agriculture or mortality to climate by comparing coefficients estimated using data from different time periods. Although convenient, such a sample-splitting approach suffers from reduced degrees of freedom and is more likely to yield noisier estimates as a result of giving up valuable information embedded in a panel structure of the data with a longer time series. Some other studies interact time trend with weather variables (e.g., Yu and Babcock, 2010), which effectively requires an ==== assumption about the smoothness and a functional form of the dependence of marginal impacts on time. In contrast, we employ flexible non-neutral time indices à la Baltagi and Griffin (1988) to let the coefficients vary with time arbitrarily thereby capturing changes in responsiveness of crop yield to weather variation. These time indices are advantageous over simple time trends (including quadratic) in modeling temporal changes because they provide richer variation in the measurement of technological change and much closer approximation to observed temporal changes (Baltagi and Griffin, 1988).====We control for unobservable cross-county heterogeneity via fixed effects which absorb time-invariant confounding variation. Failing to control for fixed effects will cause omitted variable bias because the unobservable confounders (e.g., soil quality) may correlate with weather variables. However, the direct estimation of quantile regressions with fixed effects using routine estimators is not trivial due to nonlinearity of the quantile operator which makes it impossible to purge fixed effects from the regression via any transformation (e.g., see Koenker, 2004). We tackle this problem by adapting the recently developed approach by Machado and Santos Silva (2019) that allows an easy-to-implement indirect estimation of the quantile parameters via moments and is more fitting for nonlinear specifications. We now discuss the econometric strategy.

We develop a novel matching IV strategy to address endogeneity concerns that complements traditional historical infrastructure instruments to provide time-varying identification in a panel data setting. We find that the estimated elasticity of VKT with respect to road length is approximately 1, indicating that newly built urban roads lead to a proportional increase in total traffic. Given significant ongoing infrastructure investment and more recently enacted traffic alleviation policies in many Chinese cities, this result provides important new information on the impacts of infrastructure investment on traffic.","Traffic in cities is an inevitable outcome of urbanization and population growth. Increasing levels of traffic not only affect daily commute times in urban areas, but also increase the cost of commuting and create economic inefficiencies (Stopher, 2004). Construction of additional roads is a common policy response to address traffic externalities, with widespread adoption in many countries including the United States (Hansen et al. 1993), China and India (Pucher et al. 2007). Intuitively, additional roads dilute existing traffic; however, road expansion also induces new traffic which is likely to offset some of the anticipated traffic reduction benefits of new road construction (Duranton and Turner, 2011). Newly constructed roads induce new traffic by facilitating car travel and creating an incentive for individuals to choose vehicle commuting over alternative transportation modes. For policymakers considering investments in road infrastructure, it is important to account for the magnitude of induced new traffic relative to the extent of newly constructed roadways.====This paper estimates the causal effect of urban road expansion on Vehicle-Kilometers Traveled (VKT) across 103 Chinese cities. Given rapid economic growth and increasing urban populations in China, addressing increasing levels of road traffic is a significant challenge facing policymakers. According to the Beijing Transportation Research Center, congestion in Beijing during 2015 classified as beyond a moderate level lasted for more than 3 h per day, compared to 1 h and 55 min in2014.==== This level of congestion is not a unique issue in only a handful of large cities but has emerged as a widespread and growing problem across China. By 2015, 13 major Chinese cities, including Beijing, had implemented driving restrictions to mitigate congestion, with a number of additional cities planning to enact similar restrictions.====Rapidly increasing road traffic, particularly in developing countries, also raises a number of environmental concerns.==== Vehicle travel is one of the major contributors to urban air pollution in China generating emissions such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter (Cai and Xie, 2007). Research in China shows that increased road traffic significantly raises the level of air pollution and the cost of health care (Fu and Gu, 2017; Zhong et al. 2017). In response to these concerns, the Chinese government has recently implemented traffic control policies in a number of areas to address pollution levels (He et al. 2016; Viard and Fu, 2015) and invested in expansion of public transit systems (Li et al. 2019). Road traffic is also a primary contributor to noise in urban settings which has been shown to impact the health and wellbeing of nearby residents (Pucher et al. 2007; Song et al. 2016).====To support economic growth and reduce traffic externalities, China is investing significant financial resources to construct new urban roads (Baum-Snow et al. 2015a, 2015b). As reported by the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBS), the total length of urban roads across the country increased from 130,000 km in 1995 to 365,000 km in 2015, nearly tripling over the past 20 years. One goal of this roadway investment is to ease traffic (Sun et al. 2018). With ongoing policy effort to address traffic concerns and make investments in new roadway infrastructure, understanding drivers’ behavioral changes to road provision and the relationship between roads and traffic is a key input into current policy discussions.====In this paper, we make three primary contributions to the existing literature. First, we provide new insights into urban traffic and transportation infrastructure construction by showing that roadway expansion in China has led to a proportional increase in the total amount of traffic. This is the first comprehensive empirical analysis in China that links roadway infrastructure construction with traffic, using a novel dataset that contains panel data on traffic volume in 103 cities across China from 2011 to 2014. Unlike previous research that focuses on the expansion and traffic of interstate highways, we focus on municipal roadways in urban areas where traffic affects households’ daily lives directly and broadly. Second, we examine changes in traffic in a context where economic growth and urban expansion is occurring rapidly. With rapid economic growth across Chinese cities, the speed at which adjustment to new roadway expansion occurs is an open question. Using panel data over a relatively short period provides insights into how quickly traffic changes in response to new road provision in our developing country setting.====Our third contribution is the development of a novel matching IV strategy to address endogeneity and aid causal identification. We use nearest neighbor matching (Abadie and Imbens, 2002) to construct a time-varying instrument capturing competitive effects from investments in “other cities” (Hausman, 1996). Road construction in similar, but distant, cities is correlated with local road investment due to competition for public infrastructure funding. However, distant urban roads are unlikely to have a direct impact on local traffic. We combine this instrument with cross-sectional historical infrastructure instruments (Baum-Snow et al. 2015a, 2015b) to investigate the causal effect of road construction on VKT. We find that the estimated elasticity of VKT with respect to road length is approximately 1, indicating that newly built urban roads lead to a proportional increase in total traffic.",Does road expansion induce traffic?

We used the Danish government’s public release of information regarding antibiotic use among pig farms in summer 2010 as a quasi-experiment to exploit the variation in the intensity of damage to farmers’ reputation. The study finds that the information disclosure has induced a significant (20–30%) reduction in pig farmer’s subsequent antibiotic use, with the largest reductions for farms specialized in finisher pig production, both when evaluating the volume of active compounds and the number of prescribed doses. The results also show that the public disclosure has no effect on the survival of farmers in the market, however; it has induced input substitution in terms of increased purchase of vaccines.","Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has been widely recognized as one of the most serious global public health threats (WHO, 2014). For example, it has been estimated that drug-resistant infections have led to around 25,000 deaths annually in the European Union (EU, 2009) and a report by O’Neill (2016) suggests that by 2050, 10 million people per year will die from antibiotic-resistant bacteria worldwide. Agriculture accounts for the lion’s share of total consumption (Laxminarayan 2002, 2017; Mossialos, 2010; Aarestrup, 2012; Laxminarayan et al., 2013; Agersø and Aarestrup, 2013; Laxminarayan, 2014; Ventola, 2015). For example, it represents approximately 80% of total consumption in the United States and Canada (Laxminarayan, 2002; Bartlett et al., 2013; Public Health agency of Canada 2016). Due to concern for externalities in the form of transmitting AMR from livestock to humans, the agricultural use of antibiotics and the possibilities for regulating their use have attracted considerable interest among researchers and policy makers.====In the literature, both command and control (CAC) and incentive-based instruments have been suggested to deter overuse of antibiotics. CAC regulations such as simultaneous use of a heterogeneous mix of antibiotics (Bonhoeffer et al., 1997; Laxminarayan and Weitzman, 2002); cycling of antibiotics (Laxminarayan and Brown, 2001) and antibiotic stewardship program (Dellit et al., 2007) have been recommended. With regard to market incentives, the literature suggests a pigovian tax on consumption of antibiotics (Coast et al., 1998; Rudholm, 2002) or on production of antibiotics (Vågsholm and Höjgård, 2010). Tradable permits for antibiotic prescriptions have also been suggested for general practitioners (Smith and Coast, 1998; Coast et al., 1998) and farmers (Belay et al., 2020). Another strand of literature suggests broadening the scope (Laxminarayan, 2002) and length (Herrmann, 2010; Kesselheim and Outterson, 2010) of antibiotic patents.====By decreasing the cost of collecting, organizing, and disseminating data, the information age has added new instruments to regulators’ policy mix by potentially reducing the information asymmetry between producers and consumers regarding the producers’ conduct. In particular, the internet and social media have strengthened opportunities for regulators to enforce compliance through public disclosure of images and identities of violators of rules and standards. With growing attention placed on the role of social capital (which comprises “features of social organization such as networks, norms, and social trust that facilitate coordination and cooperation for mutual benefit”, Putnam, 1993), and of reputation for prosocial behavior (Bénabou and Tirole, 2006), such information disclosure can affect agents’ reputation and access to benefits from social capital. Risk of disclosure may thus subsequently incentivize agents’ self-regulation in the direction of better compliance with given standards. Such efforts can substitute or complement CAC or market-based policy instruments (Kennedy et al., 1994, Tietenberg, 1998, Bjorner et al., 2004, Elnaboulsi et al., 2018). In fact, information disclosure has been put forward as a third-generation regulatory instrument (Tietenberg, 1998). From a regulator’s point of view, such a disclosure approach may be attractive, as it would require less administration and enforcement cost for the authorities (although some costs may still be necessary to establish the data and documentation, upon which the disclosure should be based). Furthermore, the effectiveness of regulation via disclosure may be different, because the agents’ compliance with the rules is enforced by market mechanisms rather than governmental enforcement measures.====Information disclosure programs have been shown to achieve some success in encouraging pro-social behavior, e.g., the US Toxic Release Program (Hamilton, 1995). However, it is also a controversial policy instrument as it can sometimes lead to unintended consequences in terms of substitution in pollution inputs (Gibson, 2018), costly losses and market over-reaction. It may lead to disproportional ‘naming and shaming’ and even social exclusion of violators, which may hinder violators’ future compliance (Karp, 1998). Moreover, it could facilitate anticompetitive collusive behavior by providing focal points; for instance, firms can use disclosed information as signals to reduce strategic uncertainty and potentially undermine regulatory policy and market performance (Elnaboulsi et al., 2018). Information disclosure can have even more dramatic impacts when it involves an immediate private benefit such as food safety related to, e.g., salmonella outbreaks (Smed and Jensen, 2005) or antibiotic resistance in animal food products.====How does public information disclosure affect farmers’ compliance with ‘good agricultural practice’ when it comes to antibiotic use? On the one hand, if public disclosure of relatively high antibiotic use causes only temporary damage to the farmer’s reputation, disclosure could incentivize further compliance with antibiotic standards. On the other hand, if public disclosure leads to permanent reputational damage, it may weaken the incentive to reduce antibiotic use because reputational loss is then a sunk cost. It is important to note that farmers are often family owned and public exposure also works in terms of ‘naming and shaming’ effects which may have a fairly permanent character. This theoretical trade-off between temporary and permanent damage to reputation due to disclosure is a main reason why the issue of using public disclosure as a regulatory instrument is highly debated among public policy makers.====Denmark - as the first country ever – enacted a public disclosure of private information about individual farms’ ‘too high’ antibiotic consumption in summer 2010. Due to increasing concern for AMR during the last couple of decades, the Danish Ministry of Environment and Food has operated a series of campaigns to regulate antibiotic use in agriculture, as livestock production accounts for around two thirds of total antibiotics use in Denmark, and the pig sector alone accounts for about half of the total use, measured in kg active ingredients (Borck et al. 2015). In 1998, Denmark banned the use of antibiotic growth promoters in pig production. Since then there has been a focus on monitoring farmers’ therapeutic use of antimicrobials by establishing the VETSTAT database (Stege et al., 2003), and on limiting the use of antibiotics in livestock production. All antibiotics must be prescribed by a veterinarian, and veterinarians are not allowed to sell antibiotics to the farmers. Since 2012, a so-called Yellow Card scheme has been in place (Johansen, 2012). The Yellow Card scheme (which is based on the VETSTAT database) defines the maximum allowed use of antibiotics (maximum number of standard doses per animal, determined as approximately twice the average use for sows and piglets, weaner pigs and finisher pigs, respectively). Use beyond these thresholds triggers a “yellow card” warning, accompanied by a fine and a series of mandatory veterinarian consultations to solve the animal health problems that have led to the high use. In the summer of 2010, and as part of the preparation of the Yellow Card scheme, the Ministry of Environment and Food issued notification letters to 1249 pig farms with antibiotic use close to or above this threshold (based on VETSTAT data on the use between mid-2009 and mid-2010) in order to make them aware of their need for action. However, the parliamentary committee following the work requested the Ministry to release the list of pig farms receiving these notification letters====, and this list was subsequently published in the Danish Parliament website (2010). In particular, the pig farms exposed in the 2010 disclosure were those with an antibiotic use exceeding the 80% of the yellow card threshold, and sensitive private information, such as owner’s or company’s name and address, was widely disseminated by several electronic and print media outlets (such as ====, ====, ==== and ====) (Alban et al., 2013). Although the publication of this list of farms was not a part of the official Danish policy to control farms’ use of antibiotics, the present study exploits this unique policy event to provide empirical evidence regarding the effects of such information disclosure on subsequent antibiotic use among specialized Danish pig farms. The step is analysed in the following as a policy intervention (quasi-experiment) in terms of its impact on farmers’ subsequent behavior. Viewed as a policy intervention, the disclosure was characterized by being 1) unexpected by the farmers, 2) disclosing only high-using farms, and 3) a one-off event (but with no guarantee that it could not be repeated).====Such public disclosure is presumed to be an important event in a developed society like Denmark, where there are well informed buyers with serious health concerns regarding antibiotic use in food production (Mørkbak et al., 2011), and where there is high public awareness about human infections from antibiotic-resistant bacteria in livestock and food (including resistant strains of Salmonella and Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus CC398). For these reasons, the event also caught considerable attention in the broader press media.====Several papers have studied how information disclosure might affect industrial producers’ behavior toward environmental regulation (Hamilton, 1995; Khanna et al., 1998; Konar and Cohen, 1997; Cohen, and Santhakumar 2007; García et al., 2007; Bennear and Olmstead, 2008; Delmas et al., 2010; Powers et al., 2011; Campa, 2018; Elnaboulsi et al., 2018); consumer protection (Dranove et al., 2003; Jin and Leslie, 2003; Ramanarayanan and Snyder, 2012; Seira et al., 2017) and criminal justice (e.g., Luca, 2011; Webbink et al., 2017). However, none of these studies examined the contexts of antibiotic use, which is known to affect private benefits and may have far-reaching consequences. Therefore, this study contributes to the existing literature on the link between information disclosure, regulatory enforcement and compliance by providing first empirical evidence for the effects of information disclosure on antibiotic regulation using a unique dataset for antibiotic use in agriculture and a generalized difference-in-difference identification strategy with matching, and by addressing heterogeneous responses in different types of pig production systems.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section two presents a theoretical framework for the analysis. Section three addresses the data and empirical strategy, section four presents the results and section five discusses the findings.

The two environmental issues could be linked through people’s general tastes for environmental amenities helping to determine residential location choice, implying that residents of heavily-polluted neighbourhoods may care less about environmental amenities in general, including greenspace. Alternatively, high pollution levels could force people to reduce their local outdoor activities and thereby devalue urban greenspace as local recreational resources. Finally, residents of severely-polluted areas may derive additional benefits from greenspace as trees can enhance air quality. To examine these issues, we undertook choice experiment surveys in Beijing to elicit willingness to pay (WTP) for three types of greenspace: a neighbourhood park near respondents’ homes, a city park in central Beijing and a national park outside the city. We then used air pollution data to help explain the spatial heterogeneity in WTP. Neighbourhood parks provide direct air purification services for communities nearby, and our results indeed suggest that respondents exposed to higher pollution levels have higher WTP for a new neighbourhood park. However, we failed to find evidence of a significant effect of pollution on WTP for a new city park or a new national park.","A substantial body of literature seeks to measure the economic value of green amenities such as parks and forests.==== This literature is by and large intended to inform land-use decision making as to whether the net benefits of green amenities outweigh the benefits of other competing land-use options. The findings of previous studies exhibit considerable heterogeneity in terms of the relative value of greenspace and the determinants of this value (Bateman and Jones, 2003; Brander and Koetse, 2011; D’Amato et al., 2016; Ferraro et al., 2012; Ninan and Inoue, 2013). Such heterogeneity has likely sprung from differences in methodology, the features of green amenities being valued, and the characteristics of those who benefit. Possible determinants of value which have been explored include local socioeconomic and demographic features such as income levels (Perino et al., 2014; Schindler et al., 2018) and age (Arnberger and Eder, 2011), the presence of substitute outdoor recreation sites (Schaafsma et al., 2013; Thiene et al., 2017), the proximity to and conditions of existing green amenities (Czajkowski et al., 2017), perceptions of nuisances associated with improperly managed greenspaces such as crime (Troy and Grove, 2008) and other antisocial behaviour (Andrews et al., 2017), and the timing of visits to green amenities such as seasons (Bartczak et al., 2012) or weekdays versus weekends (Bertram et al., 2017).====In this paper, we investigate the connections between urban air pollution and the value of green amenities. We consider three possible ways in which these two environmental issues are linked. First, where people choose to live in a city, as reflected by their exposure to air pollution, may indicate their preferences for greenspace through a residential sorting effect (Bayer et al., 2009; Klaiber and Phaneuf, 2010; Roback, 1982; Wu and Plantinga, 2003; Yinger, 2015): residents of heavily polluted neighbourhoods may have a lower appreciation of environmental amenities in general, including greenspace. Further, air pollution may have direct implications for the use value of greenspace. On the one hand, air pollution may devalue green amenities as local recreational resources, by forcing people to reduce outdoor activities on high pollution days (Bresnahan et al., 1997; Graff Zivin and Neidell, 2009), which may presumably include visits to green amenities. On the other hand, residents of severely polluted areas may derive additional benefits from greenspace, as trees are able to enhance air quality by absorbing and diffusing ambient pollutants such as particulate matter (Lin et al., 2017), ozone and nitrogen dioxide (Kroeger et al., 2014), and may be an offsetting source of utility for those living in highly-polluted urban environments. The nexus between air pollution and the value of green amenities is hence ambiguous and open to empirical investigation.====We undertook stated preference choice experiment surveys in different parts of Beijing to elicit the value of green amenities in the form of the public’s willingness to pay (WTP) for increases in the area of three types of greenspace. We purposefully valued three different types of green amenity whose values might be differently reflected by air pollution exposure: a neighbourhood park near the respondent’s home, a city park in central Beijing, and a national park in an outlying location. We then used real-time air pollution data to help explain the spatial heterogeneity in WTP for these three types of green space, whilst controlling for other possible influencing factors.====Neighbourhood parks are likely to provide direct air purification services for communities nearby, and our results indeed suggest that respondents exposed to higher levels of annual pollution are willing to pay more for a new neighbourhood park. In contrast, WTP for the city park and national park is more likely to be linked with pollution levels via the residential sorting and reduced visits mechanisms. Yet our data shows no evidence for such connections.====Pursuing this research agenda can offer appealing insights for scientific and policymaking communities from several angles. To start with, it has practical implications for land-use decision making. Urban residents’ preferences for greenspace are largely context-dependent. It is preferable yet expensive to directly investigate such preferences in every context. In the absence of such information, understanding the main factors that explain or indicate preference heterogeneity takes on pronounced importance, as this would help us more accurately adjust preferences elicited in other settings for the context being considered, and thereby identify the optimal location and timing to create or extend greenspace amenities (Choi and Koo, 2018; Czajkowski et al., 2017). In that sense, this study contributes to the literature on benefit transfer (e.g. Johnston et al., 2015), since the benefits of urban green amenities can be adjusted for variations in local air pollution levels, similar to adjusting for income and cultural differences (Hynes et al., 2013). Moreover, this study adds to a recent yet rapidly growing body of evidence on the non-health impacts of air pollution, such as work productivity (Archsmith et al., 2018; Graff Zivin and Neidell, 2012), labour supply (Hanna and Oliva, 2015), property value (Bayer et al., 2009), demand for health insurance (Chang et al., 2018), and zoo and observatory visits (Graff Zivin and Neidell, 2009).====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 sets up our proposed conceptual linkages between air pollution and WTP for greenspace. Section 3 describes the study area, the choice experiment and the data on air pollution. Section 4 reports the methods and results of our main econometric analysis. Section 5 performs a series of ancillary econometric analysis to test the robustness of our findings.

Yet economists have paid little formal attention to the value of information (VOI) provided by non-market valuation studies, and whether this value justifies the cost. We develop a novel VOI model to quantify the benefit of non-market valuation studies conducted to expand the body of value estimates in the literature, and hence available for use in policy analyses. The approach is designed to capitalize on information available through preexisting valuation meta-data, and can be applied to any valuation meta-regression that is suitable to inform policy decisions. We illustrate the approach for a prototype nationwide water-quality improvement policy in the United States, assuming that policy benefits are evaluated using benefit transfer based on a meta-regression model of willingness-to-pay. Our results suggest that, when evaluating nationwide water quality regulations with uncertain net benefits, the VOI from a typical water quality valuation study will almost certainly exceed the cost. We also examine how VOI varies with study design features and information gaps in the literature, thereby illustrating how the approach can inform research priorities.","A common refrain in the environmental economics literature is the need for additional high quality, empirical estimates of non-market values. For example, Van Houtven, Powers, and Pattanayak (2007, p 225) note “a continued need for … valuation research that can be used to address the requirements of national and regional-scale benefit assessments,” and Loomis and Rosenberger (2006, p 334) argue that there is a “lack of adequate [empirical] studies for benefit transfer.” Such pleas are particularly common within discussions of benefit transfer, but are relevant to all areas of economics for which non-market valuation results are used to inform policy decisions (Johnston et al., 2015; Johnston and Rosenberger, 2010; Loomis and Rosenberger, 2006; Lovell et al., 2004; Moeltner and Woodward, 2009; Rosenberger and Johnston, 2009; Smith and Pattanayak, 2002; Wilson and Hoehn, 2006).====Arguments regarding the need for additional valuation research are motivated by at least two related considerations. First, due to a combination of practical and procedural constraints it is not feasible to conduct original non-market valuation studies to support many policy or management decisions. This makes the transfer of estimates from the existing valuation literature (or “benefit transfer”) an unavoidable component of benefit-cost analysis (BCA) in the United States, the European Union, Australasia, and elsewhere (Griffiths et al., 2012; Johnston etal., 2018a, Johnston etal., 2018bb; Johnston and Rosenberger, 2010; Newbold et al., 2018; Wheeler, 2015). Second, when conducting benefit transfers it often is difficult to find primary studies that are a close match to the resource changes and contexts for which value estimates are needed (Boyle and Bergstrom, 1992; Lovell et al., 2004; Spash and Vatn, 2006; Stapler and Johnston, 2009). Many valuation studies in the published literature emphasize methodological novelty over the provision of high-quality welfare estimates (Johnston et al., 2015; Johnston and Rosenberger, 2010; Rosenberger and Johnston, 2009; Smith and Pattanayak, 2002). An arguable overemphasis on methodological novelty at the expense of empirical relevance has led to “an abundance of studies that are distant from the day-to-day needs of policy makers” (McComb et al., 2006, p 471). The empirical non-market valuation literature is also characterized by a relatively large number of studies in some areas (e.g., fishing and hunting) and few in others (e.g., bird watching and other forms of non-consumptive nature recreation) (Johnston and Rosenberger, 2010; Loomis and Rosenberger, 2006), and there may be a tendency for studies to focus on rare, iconic or high-value resources rather than more common environmental changes (Rosenberger and Johnston, 2009). Hence, despite the existence of thousands of non-market valuation studies in the published literature, primary studies suitable for particular policy or benefit transfer applications are often unavailable (McComb et al., 2006).====Approaches such as valuation meta-analysis (Boyle et al., 2009) and preference calibration (Smith and Pattanayak, 2002) have emerged as a way to at least partially address the paucity of valuation studies that are a good match for policy needs by relaxing the requirement for one-to-one similarity between benefit transfer study and policy sites. Yet even with sophisticated tools such as these, the accuracy and precision of any benefit transfer exercise depend on the extent and quality of the underlying body of valuation research.====This frequently acknowledged situation seems to suggest that additional valuation research is needed. Yet perhaps ironically, the non-market valuation literature has given little formal attention to the value of information (VOI) provided by non-market valuation studies. Hence, it is not generally known ex ante whether the expected VOI provided by an original valuation study exceeds the cost. The problem is exacerbated by a lack of insight into what types of valuation studies would be of greatest value to decision-makers facing specific types of decisions. The specificity of environmental values to particular spatial, temporal, environmental and economic contexts (Fisher et al., 2009)—and variation in the demand for benefit estimates relevant to these contexts—suggests that some types of studies will provide greater VOI than others. If information on the relative VOI provided by different types of valuation studies were available (e.g., studies in new areas or on rarely studied environmental changes), it could help research funding agencies develop programs to encourage valuation research with the greatest social value when applied to anticipated future decisions.====Here, we focus on valuation studies conducted primarily for publication in the peer-reviewed literature, not studies conducted explicitly for purposes of a regulatory BCA. What is the value of an original non-market valuation study conducted primarily to supplement the body of available empirical estimates and thereby support future benefit transfers? How does the value of such a study vary according to factors such as the attributes of the study design, the volume and characteristics of the existing literature, and the attributes of the future policy options that might be evaluated using that literature? What do these results imply for the optimal prioritization of future valuation research over different contexts? Despite the regularity with which claims are made regarding the need for new non-market valuation studies, the authors are aware of neither research that seeks to quantify these presumed benefits in a systematic way, nor the development of a model that would enable such an analysis to proceed.====Mature theory and methods have been developed to estimate the VOI from new research and thereby answer questions such as these (e.g., Conrad, 1980; Feltham, 1968; Laxminarayan and Macauley, 2012; Newbold and Marten, 2014; Phillips, 2001; Rein, 2012; Yakota and Thompson, 2004). VOI may be defined simply as the expected gain (or value) of “reducing uncertainty through some form of data collection exercise,” where this gain is realized because the chance of a “wrong” decision in a particular area is reduced (Wilson, 2015, p 105). VOI estimation methods are grounded in an explicit treatment of decision-making under uncertainty and consideration of the value of the improved decision outcomes that are enabled by information of certain types. As such, these models provide a formal structure through which one can estimate the value of non-market valuation research, in terms of the capacity of that research to increase the expected net economic benefits of future environmental policy or management decisions. They also provide a means to establish research priorities based on the same criterion. This is distinct from the typical situation in which researchers’ choices about what topics to study—in present context, which environmental resources to value—“evolve through an ad hoc and unstructured process of collaboration and competition among researchers, grant funding agencies, and the editors of scholarly journals” (Newbold and Marten, 2014, p 111). Hence, VOI models are well suited to quantify the value of research that increases the information content of the literature.====This paper develops a formal VOI model to quantify the benefits of original non-market valuation studies that are intended to expand the body of empirical value estimates available in the literature, and hence accessible for future use in benefit transfer applications. The approach is designed to capitalize on information available through preexisting valuation meta-data. Data of this type underpin a large and growing number of valuation meta-analyses across the literature (Johnston etal., 2018a, Johnston etal., 2018bb; Nelson and Kennedy, 2009), assessing values related to environmental resources including wetlands (Brander et al., 2012; Brander et al., 2006; Ghermandi et al., 2010; Moeltner et al., 2018; Vedogbeton and Johnston, 2020), water quality (Johnston etal., 2018a, Johnston etal., 2018ba; Johnston et al., 2005; Johnston et al., 2017; Van Houtven et al., 2007), forests (Barrio and Loureiro, 2010; Zandersen and Tol, 2009), and coral reefs (Brander et al., 2007; Londoño and Johnston, 2012), among many others. As a result, unlike most VOI models that require analysts to develop (or already have) new valuation data to populate the model, the illustrated approach relies on preexisting valuation meta-data of the type that is widely available across the environmental economics literature.====Using existing meta-data as a foundation, the model estimates the short-run demand for information provided by a new study. This demand is represented by the willingness to pay (WTP) of a hypothetical decision-maker who evaluates future policy options using an expected net benefit criterion informed by the combined body of evidence in the valuation literature. A key assumption of these models is that the decision-maker updates her beliefs related to a decision (e.g., on the value of implementing an environmental policy) by combining prior information with new study information as it becomes available. Within this context, VOI is the expected increase in the social value of the decision made possible by the new information. VOI models may also be used to prioritize future valuation studies based on the value of these potential studies for a set of prospective environmental decisions. To our knowledge, the model developed here is the first of this type in the environmental valuation literature. Although the model is developed for environmental valuation, the lack of systematic validation for the claim that “more research is needed” is not unique to this context (e.g., Phillips, 2001). The illustrated approach is therefore also relevant for contexts beyond non-market valuation and environmental policy.====We develop the model for the case in which future regulatory decisions are guided by benefit transfer conducted using an existing willingness-to-pay (WTP) meta-regression model (MRM). Here, the existing meta-data and MRM are assumed to summarize the current state of knowledge about the environmental resource in question. In this setting, each new valuation study increases the body of literature available for the meta-regression analysis, as an additional observation in the meta-data, and hence increases the potential precision of MRM benefit transfers. The illustrated VOI model not only enables estimation of the value of an “average” study added to the meta-data, but also enables identification of the type of valuation studies that would be expected to maximize returns in terms of the VOI provided. Hence, the approach not only enables the value of a new study to be estimated with respect to a prospective set of policy decisions, but also provides a mechanism through which to maximize this value and thereby help guide the direction of future valuation research. The model is designed such that all data required both for estimation and for characterizing the prior distribution of benefits for any well-defined policy proposal can be derived from the existing meta-data. Although we illustrate the approach using a particular policy scenario and set of meta-data on water quality values, the approach may be readily adapted to any decision context for which a suitable MRM is available or can be developed. We also describe how the model may be applied without full meta-data, if one instead has access only to MRM estimation results (including the estimated covariance matrix).",Valuing non-market valuation studies using meta-analysis: A demonstration using estimates of willingness-to-pay for water quality improvements,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069620301029,6 September 2020,2020,Research Article,210.0

New policies or expectations of policy changes that impact private assets, such as housing, may generate economic incentives that result in unintended consequences. We examine the effect on new housing development resulting from a scientific report by a regulatory agency mandating coastal communities in North Carolina (NC) consider sea-level rise when developing new land-use policies. Estimates from our preferred triple-differences model suggest the policy announcement increased building permits by 32% in coastal NC counties until permitting returned to pre-policy levels after a moratorium on new regulations was passed by the state legislature. Our results are supported by numerous robustness checks, including alternative controls, placebo tests and a parcel-level model in Dare County, NC. This green paradox in coastal climate adaptation implies that hundreds of millions of dollars in additional unregulated housing was constructed in NC locations vulnerable to sea-level rise likely due to perverse incentives generated by a policy signal.","Joint action from both private individuals and the public sector are likely needed for coastal areas to efficiently adapt to climate change (Mendelsohn, 2006). Without significant adaptation, sea-level rise (SLR) is expected to damage housing and infrastructure (Neumann et al., 2015), increase nuisance flooding (Karegar et al., 2017) and exposure to hurricanes (Passeri et al., 2018), displace millions of people (Hauer et al., 2016) and reduce GDP by billions of dollars (Hsiang et al., 2017). Coastal land markets have potential to play a pivotal part in incentivizing private adaptation to help mitigate these risks (Anderson et al., 2019). Yet recent empirical evidence suggests limited private responses as homeowners tend to underestimate SLR risk (Bakkensen and Barrage, 2017) and this risk is not capitalizing into housing prices for certain market segments (Bernstein et al., 2019; Filippova et al., 2020). Complex interactions of private property and public goods in coastal areas necessitate policy interventions to incentivize efficient adaptation but such efforts also have their challenges. Examples such as the green paradox in greenhouse gas mitigation policies (Sinn, 2008) and anticipatory destruction of habitat to avoid land-use regulations under the Endangered Species Act (Lueck and Michael, 2003) suggest a cautionary approach to public climate adaptation policies that recognizes the potential for perverse economic incentives to generate unintended consequences.====In the context of SLR, land-use regulations are a practical public adaptation strategy to limit future risk but are currently limited in practice due to the uncertainty of climate impacts (Nicholls and Cazebave, 2010), the timescales and spatial variability over which future impacts may occur (Clark et al., 2016; Portmann et al., 2009) and budget and political constraints. In the United States (US), the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) of 1972 created a policy infrastructure for states to develop and implement coastal land-use management programs, yet explicit plans to account for SLR have been slow to take shape. Discovering and assessing how coastal land markets may respond to new limits on development is a critical step toward efficient public adaptation to climate change. Here we explore the impacts on housing supply decisions in vulnerable coastal areas in the US state of North Carolina (NC) when a SLR adaptation policy signal is generated by a powerful public regulatory authority.====Our analysis centers on how owners of vacant or underutilized land in coastal NC respond to a regulatory signal that proposes future land-use restrictions or building code changes for properties at risk from SLR. NC is particularly vulnerable to SLR with a large coastal plain below 1 m in elevation (>5000 km====) (Titus and Richman, 2001; Bin et al., 2011). The regulatory agency is the NC Coastal Resources Commission (CRC), which has significant authority in implementing policies for coastal development and certification of local land use plans. In March 2010, the science panel within the CRC issued a report suggesting 1 m of SLR by 2100 should be accounted for in coastal land-use decisions. The NC State Legislature made national headlines 29 months later (August 2012) when lobbying efforts by coastal business leaders and stakeholders resulted in a moratorium on creating new policies based on the 1 m SLR forecast (H.B. 819).==== Our hypothesis is that since developers were aware of the regulatory authority of the CRC in governing coastal land use under NC's Coastal Area Management Act (CAMA),==== the policy signal may influence the timing of housing starts and the overall supply of at-risk coastal housing. Using a triple-differences estimation strategy, we find evidence that these signals generated incentives that accelerated the pace of new housing permits and construction, thereby increasing the value of housing stock vulnerable to damage from SLR before new regulations could come into force.====Recent work on the impact of SLR and other coastal hazards on private decisions in housing markets suggests that coastal residents maintain relatively low risk perceptions of future flooding and SLR (Bakkensen and Barrage, 2017) and are not responding to SLR risk disclosures in housing market transactions (Filippova et al., 2020). Owner-occupied homes vulnerable to SLR are selling at similar prices to those without risk (Bernstein et al., 2019) and high-income households are likely to remain due, in part, to significant natural amenities offered by coastal living (Smith and Whitmore, 2020; Lee and Lin, 2018). The salience of hazard risk in housing markets has also been shown to be fleeting after a disaster, with discounts vanishing in as little as four years for flooded properties (Atreya et al., 2013) and two years for high-risk wildfire areas (McCoy and Walsh, 2018). Privately adapting by protecting current infrastructure with hardened shorelines (e.g., bulkheads, seawalls, rip-rap) has been shown to capitalize into housing prices (Walsh et al., 2019; Dundas and Lewis, 2020), although this action may introduce potential for negative spatial externalities on neighboring properties (Dundas and Lewis, 2020).==== Taken together, this literature suggests relying on markets to adapt may be unlikely to efficiently mitigate SLR risks to coastal housing.====Public policy response in the US to climate-related natural hazards tends to be ex-post (Davlasheridze et al., 2017) and this disaster relief has potential to crowd out private adaptation investments, such as insurance (Kousky et al., 2018). Other public adaptation options in coastal areas may seek to limit future development and relocate productive resources away from low-lying areas (Kousky, 2014), strengthen building codes (Aerts et al., 2014), or increase investments in natural habitats, such as dunes and wetlands, to provide protection for housing and infrastructure (Arkema et al., 2013; Dundas, 2017; Qiu and Gopalakrishnan, 2018; Sun and Carson, 2020). Behavioral responses to public policies may also result in unintended consequences or seemingly paradoxical outcomes. A primary example is the green paradox, which occurs when anticipation of a future policy intended to mitigate carbon emissions induces suppliers to extract fossil fuels more quickly, thereby increasing emissions in the short term (Sinn, 2008, 2015; Michielsen, 2014; van der Ploeg and Withagen, 2015; Gronwald et al., 2017). The potential magnitude of the effect is often debated as empirical evidence ranges from showing little to no effect (Di Maria et al., 2014) to impacts that are dependent on fuel type and policy implementation lags (Bauer et al., 2018). A foundational national environmental policy, the US Endangered Species Act, has also been shown to generate outcomes that run counter to the intended purpose. Landowners may have preemptively destroyed thousands of acres critical habitat to avoid future land-use regulations on their private property (Lueck and Michael, 2003).====We focus here on the impact of public policy on housing development timing decisions in response to policy changes. One strategy available to policy-makers is to enact zoning or building regulations designed to decrease property losses in the event of storms, flooding or other natural hazards. For example, Florida implemented stringent building codes in response to Hurricane Andrew to limit the loss of life and property during future storms (Kunreuther, 2006) and evidence suggests the price of vacant land in vulnerable areas decreased significantly after these building code changes (Dehring, 2006).==== Such changes in land-use regulations are also likely to impact development timing decisions as markets internalize expected policy changes (Titman, 1985; Mayer and Somerville, 2000; Mayo and Sheppard, 2001; Cunningham, 2007). Titman (1985) demonstrated that greater uncertainty in future prices and demand conditions is directly related to the development timing decision, with more uncertainty increasing option value and thus increasing developer incentives to delay land conversion decisions. Conversely, the threat of a regulatory taking may reduce option value and increase development of vacant land in the short term (Riddiough, 1997). In an empirical example, an urban-growth boundary (UGB) policy was shown to be effective at reducing the likelihood of urban sprawl outside of Seattle, Washington's UGB, but may have lowered incentives to delay development decisions in more urban areas (Cunningham, 2007).====Our first contribution is to identify and estimate the magnitude of a green paradox in climate adaptation policy. Our research design exploits the exogenous timing of two policy signals from a powerful regulatory authority and spatial variation in jurisdictions that may be impacted by future land-use regulations. This strategy allows us to estimate a plausibly causal relationship between the release and subsequent repeal of the policy signal and new residential development decisions. Since our variable of interest, new housing permits, is count data, we use a negative binomial estimation strategy to identify the intention-to-treat (ITT) effect of the policy signals. Our preferred model utilizes a triple-differences approach where we estimate this effect in coastal NC by differencing away the effects across a neighboring state (South Carolina) and between inland areas unaffected by the policy signal.==== We find that building permits increased 32% after the release of the report and remained elevated after the report's repeal, albeit statistically insignificant. We also estimate a parcel-level difference-in-differences model in Dare County, NC where 15% of parcels could be inundated by 2080 with losses exceeding $1.2 billion (Bin et al., 2011). In this model, we compare new permits within the SLR risk zone targeted in the report to those outside the risk zone within the same county. We find evidence that permitting increased 42% in areas vulnerable to 1.2 m of SLR, suggesting the increase in development is likely occurring on land within counties directly targeted in the SLR report. These findings suggest the magnitude of the green paradox effect is $685 million of additional unregulated housing constructed in coastal NC in the 29 months between release and repeal of the SLR report.====We also inform the climate adaptation literature by identifying a critical barrier to effective implementation of policy. Our results suggest that the timing, content, and messenger of such policy announcements can influence expectations and change behavior. We find significant temporal leakage of housing development decisions, whereby individuals pull forward anticipated regulated future construction to the unregulated present day, thereby increasing the amount and value of property at risk from SLR. This is analogous to a harvesting effect in the context of environmental impacts on mortality (e.g., Barreca et al., 2016) but differs in a key dimension. Lack of policy specifics and the indefinite implementation lag suggest that even if the amount of long-run development was not impacted by the policy signal (i.e., homes built in response were “harvested” and simply built earlier than planned), the share of that development in risky low-lying areas or built without new building codes designed to mitigate SLR risk has increased significantly. In other words, policymakers have foregone the opportunity to regulate new construction that occurred as a result of the policy signal and this temporal leakage of development decisions likely increases the SLR vulnerability of NC's coastal housing stock. The magnitude of the paradoxical behavior effect measured here is consistent with the signal coming from a powerful regulatory authority and points to a need to evaluate how coastal land-use policies for adaptation are developed and implemented. Such changes could include redistribution of regulatory authority, engagement with stakeholders in rule-making, or for policies that necessarily are announced prior to implementation, retroactive penalties to disincentive perverse behavioral responses. Lastly, we provide new evidence on land development timing decisions (Titman, 1985; Mayer and Somerville, 2000; Mayo and Sheppard, 2001; Cunningham, 2007) and a supply-side complement to recent work on coastal housing market demand responses to SLR (Bakkensen and Barrage, 2017; Bernstein et al., 2019; Filippova et al., 2020; Walsh et al., 2019; Dundas and Lewis, 2020).====This article proceeds as follows. The next section provides context about the policy setting. The third section discusses a simple model of housing development decisions and option values that connects to our empirical model. In section 4, we discuss our data and section 5 presents our empirical framework, including discussion of identification with non-linear panel models. In section 6 we discuss our triple-difference model results, parcel-level model results, and a series of robustness checks. Section 7 estimates the magnitude of the green paradox effect and the final section summarizes our findings and the potential policy implications of this research.","Fall in the sea, eventually?

Therefore, aggregate estimates of the average effect of warming may be insufficient to model climate change vulnerability. In this study, I propose a quantile model for the distributional effect of climate change. I estimate interquantile regressions of land value on climate using agricultural census data for 464,277 commercial farms in Brazil. I find that the effects of climate change in Brazilian agriculture vary significantly by climate, land quality, and irrigation choice. A 1 °C of warming is more detrimental to farms in warm climates, those with high-quality land, and those using irrigation. A 100-mm decrease in annual precipitation is more damaging to farms in dry climates, those with low-quality land, and those using irrigation. The heterogeneity in climate change effects is particularly large within the subset of farms in the warmest or the driest climates, as the most vulnerable farms appear to be those that have reached their limits for climate adaptation.","Worldwide, the impact of global warming is likely to vary across farms owing to differences in the local climate, economic development, and adaptive capacity (Hsiang et al., 2019; Field, 2014; Hornbeck and Keskin, 2014; Hornbeck, 2012; Annan and Schlenker, 2015; Mendelsohn et al., 2006; Tol et al., 2004; Rosenzweig and Parry, 1994). Climate change policies must therefore account for heterogeneity in vulnerability and determine its drivers and future evolution. However, modeling such distributional effects (DEs) on small scales is challenging due to methodological constraints and a lack of data. In this article, I investigate diverse climate change impacts on farm profitability by estimating Ricardian quantile functions using agricultural census data from Brazil.====Within this framework, I use interquantile models to estimate the DE of 1 °C of warming and a 100-mm increase in annual precipitation and to distinguish the marginal effects of climate change for different quantiles of a land value distribution (Koenker and Bassett, 1978; Koenker, 2005; Buchinsky, 1994). The essence of the Ricardian quantile model is to capture the interaction between climate and unobserved land quality that could induce heterogeneity in climate vulnerability. For example, an unobserved plot attribute such as the water-holding capacity of the soil may modulate the effect of reduced precipitation or change the marginal return of adaptation investments such as irrigation. I follow Chesher (2003) semiparametric framework to identify local quantile effects, which provides a simple interpretation of the Ricardian quantile functions.==== The quantile model ranks farms based on unobserved land quality such that the quantile estimates of climate change effects capture climate response at different levels of unobserved land quality. By “fixing” unobserved land quality, the quantile model enables a comparison of marginal effects of climate change across the conditional distribution of farm profitability.====The quantile Ricardian model is suitable for the Brazilian case because the country has a diverse climate and economy and micro data are available. The annual average temperature ranges from 16.9 to 26.1 °C and land values per hectare vary from R$134 to R$20,000 (5th–95th percentiles).==== The novel dataset used in this study combines the farm-level version of a national agricultural census (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics [Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística Ibge, 2006) with soil characteristics at the municipality level (EMBRAPA, 2012) and climate data at the census block level (Willmott and Matsuura, 2001).==== I divide the agricultural sector into commercial and subsistence farms and focus on the commercial segment, which comprises 464,277 farms. These farms account for 86% of agricultural production in Brazil and satisfy the profit maximization and perfect land market assumptions in the Ricardian model.====I obtain three main findings. First, I find that 1 °C of warming in locations with a mean annual temperature higher than 21 °C is more detrimental to farms with high and moderate land quality. For example, this amount of warming reduces the land values of farms with moderate land quality (0.5 quantile) by 12%, while farms with low land quality (0.1 quantile) experience a 7% reduction in land values. As a result, the gap in profitability between farms with high-quality land and those with low-quality land decreases with warming. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that farmers with higher-quality land tend to invest in more profitable and specialized production systems, which are more sensitive to further warmer (Hornbeck and Keskin, 2014). By contrast, in places with a mean temperature lower than 21 °C, the effect of 1 °C of warming is small and similar across all farms, regardless of land quality. In these colder climates the DE of 1 °C of warming is not statistically significant.====Second, I find that farms with low-quality land are very sensitive to changes in precipitation. A 100-mm decrease in annual precipitation is associated with an 18% reduction in land values for farms with low-quality land (0.9 quantile) and an 8% reduction for farms with moderate-quality land (0.5 quantile). A reduction in precipitation thus increases the gap in profitability between farms with high- and low-quality land by 10%.====Finally, I investigate potential sources of heterogeneity in climate change effects by estimating a Ricardian quantile model for farms with irrigation and for farms at extreme combinations of climate and unobserved land quality. I find large heterogeneity in the impacts of climate change among these groups of farms. For farms with irrigation, a 100-mm decrease in precipitation increases the gap in profitability by 30% between farms with high- and low-quality land. The DE of temperature is also approximately 30% within the group of farms located in either the warmest or driest places in Brazil. The farms with low-quality land that have irrigation or are located in these extreme climates are at the frontier of vulnerability, as they have likely reached the limits of climate adaptation. These farms are very sensitive to small changes in temperature or precipitation.====This study primarily contributes to the emerging empirical literature on the heterogeneity of climate change effects and distribution of climate change damage. Recent empirical studies in agriculture have investigated potential drivers of such heterogeneity.==== Annan and Schlenker (2015) model the interaction between weather and crop insurance coverage in the United States and find evidence that insurance disincentives farmer adaptation to extreme heat. Hornbeck (2012) finds a differentiated effect of the American Dust Bowl on county-level land values by soil erosion level. Hornbeck and Keskin (2014) model changes in drought sensitivity in the Ogallala aquifer region after the introduction of new irrigation technology, and they find that locations without access to groundwater are more drought resistant.====This study departs from the previous literature by applying quantile models to estimate heterogeneous damage functions by farm productivity and by studying a developing country with a diverse climate and economy.==== I test the estimation of DEs for different categories of commercial farms with larger datasets and by farm and market characteristics such as the presence of irrigation. In some specifications, I also control for the interactions between climate and potential confounding variables such as market access and soil characteristics. Further, I compare the median quantile functions with ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions with local fixed effects to control for the potential confounding effect of local agricultural policies. Using a complete set of climate and market access variables and their interactions, I find that my DE estimates are robust.====The estimation of the DEs of climate change also contributes to the broader empirical literature on climate change impacts (Mendelsohn et al., 1994; Deschênes and Greenstone, 2007; Burke and Emerick, 2016; Schlenker et al., 2005; Schlenker and Roberts, 2009; Ortiz-Bobea, 2013) and to studies of improvements in Ricardian models (Massetti and Mendelsohn, 2011; Fezzi and Bateman, 2015; Severen et al., 2018; Ortiz-Bobea, 2016; Timmins, 2006; Van Passel, Massetti, and Mendelsohn, 2017; Hendricks, 2018; Ortiz-Bobea, 2020) by identifying when the conditional mean estimates of climate change impacts represent the damage caused by warming and drying.====The remainder of this article is organized as follows. In the next section, I extend the Ricardian model to show the sources of variation in climate change impacts and I describe the identification of the DEs. I describe the dataset in Section 3.

We provide the first estimate of the long-term effects of climate change on the labor market based on the hedonic approach, which accounts for individual long-term adjustments to climate change. Using a panel of field survey data from 8076 working age residents in 279 rural communities in China, we find that a 1 °C increase from current mean temperature will reduce an average rural resident’s time allocated to farm work by 7.0%, increase the time allocated to off-farm work by 7.8%, and reduce the time allocated to leisure by 0.8%. We also find differential responses to climate change across gender: higher temperatures mainly shift males’ time from leisure to off-farm work, but mainly shift females’ time from farm work to off-farm work.","Understanding the socio-economic consequences of climate change is critical to the design of optimal climate policies (Dell et al., 2012; IPCC, 2014). A growing body of literature has identified substantial and far-reaching impacts of climate change on agriculture (Mendelsohn et al., 1994), economic growth (Burke et al., 2015b), civil conflict (Burke et al., 2015a), human health (Deschenes, 2014), human capital (Graff Zivin et al., 2018), and labor productivity (Zhang et al., 2018).====The current study explores the potential impact of climate change on the labor market.==== Climate change is more likely to damage climate-exposed sectors than sectors less vulnerable to high temperatures (Mendelsohn, 2008; Burke et al., 2015b; Dellink et al., 2017). The disproportionate damage created by climate change generates a gap in marginal returns to labor across sectors. As a result, individuals tend to reallocate labor from sectors that are more severely damaged to less vulnerable sectors. Since labor is a critical production factor, the economic and welfare implications associated with climate-induced labor reallocation are potentially quite large.====However, this potential channel through which climate change may affect economic performance and social welfare has not received the attention it deserves. The current understanding of the effect of climate change on labor allocation comes mainly from empirical studies that infer the effect of long-term climate change through examining the effect of short-lived weather fluctuations (Connolly, 2008; Graff Zivin and Neidell, 2014; Jessoe et al., 2018).==== Considering individuals are more likely to adapt to a gradual change in climate than to idiosyncratic and short-lived weather shocks (Seo, 2013; Moore and Lobell, 2014), the ==== of long-term climate change impact on labor allocation could be significantly different from short-run weather fluctuations.====To fill this gap in the literature, we estimate the long-term effects of climate change on labor allocation using the “hedonic approach” (Mendelsohn et al., 1994; Mendelsohn and Massetti, 2017), which accounts for individual long-term adjustments to climate change. The hedonic approach identifies the effects by cross-sectional long-term climate differences. Since individuals on average should have enough time to fully adjust their behavior to the long-term climate of their region, the effects identified by this approach should incorporate long-term adaptation information (Mendelsohn et al., 1994). To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first to employ the hedonic approach to identify the long-term effects of climate change on individual-level labor allocation.====A significant concern of the traditional cross-sectional hedonic approach is omitting variables. To address this concern, we adopted an improved hedonic approach that identifies the long-term effects in a panel framework. As suggest by Massetti and Mendelsohn (2011), the problem of omitted variables can be significantly reduced in a panel framework with fixed effects. In addition, we have also checked the sensitivity of our findings to omitted variables by including various control variables and found comparable results.====Depending on a panel of field survey data from 8076 working age residents in 279 rural communities in China, we find that a 1 °C increase from current mean temperature will reduce an average rural resident’s time allocated to farm work by 7.0%, increase the time allocated to off-farm work by 7.8%, and reduce the time allocated to leisure by 0.8%. These findings are robust to alternative climatic measures, omitted variables, estimation methods, and the decision-making processes. We also find differential responses to climate change across gender: higher temperatures mainly shift males’ time from leisure to off-farm work, but mainly shift females’ time from farm work to off-farm work. Under the medium climate change scenario RCP 4.5, we predict the end-of-the-century climate change will reduce rural residents’ farm work time by 15.5%, increase their off-farm work time by 17.1%. Combining these estimates with the overall labor supply in rural China, we roughly estimate that climate change will reduce the agricultural labor supply by 40.0 million people and increase the off-farm labor supply by 44.1 million people.====This article complements the preceding studies that infer the long-term effects of climate change on the labor market through examining the short-run effect of temperature shocks (Graff Zivin and Neidell, 2014; Jessoe et al., 2018).==== These studies generally identified statistically significant effects only for changes in extreme heat (but not mean temperature) and the effects identified are very small. For example, based on the same climate change projection as the present study, Jessoe et al. (2018) predicts that increases in extreme heat will reduce the probability that a rural Mexican works in his/her home village by 0.31%. Based on the hedonic approach, which allows individuals to fully adjust their behavior to climate change in the long run, we find a much larger labor reallocation effect, mainly from changes in the mean temperature (but not extreme heat). The larger effect in the long run is intuitive, because the existence of quasi-fixed physical capital limits labor reallocation in the short run. In the next section we provide a theoretical model to explain this in detail.====This article also contributes to the literature on migration and adaptation. Previous studies have identified various determinants of rural-urban migration, such as income gaps (Carrington et al., 1996), local credit and insurance markets (Woodruff and Zenteno, 2007), and farmland property rights (Acemoglu et al., 2001). Although there is growing interest in the effect of global environmental change on migration (see,e.g., Boano et al., 2008; Black et al., 2011), rigorous empirical evidence for this issue is rare (Bohra-Mishra et al., 2014).==== We contribute to the literature by examining the size of the effect of climate change on migration. This article also contributes to the literature on climate change adaptation. Adaptation is central to the climate change impact study because it may determine the future severity of the impact (Mendelsohn et al., 1994; Lobell et al., 2008). Although various adaptation methods have been examined,==== adaptation to climate change by time reallocation has been generally ignored.====Finally, although an economy-wide structural shift from employment in agricultural to nonagricultural activities is a typical feature of the development process (Kuznets, 1955; Poston et al., 2010), the welfare implications of the climate change induced rural-urban migration could be quite different from those caused by economic development: it is not necessarily associated with improved urban labor demand. If urban areas are ill-equipped to absorb a massive influx of migrants, climate change may aggravate urban unemployment and urban poverty, which are vital concerns for some developing countries (see, e.g., Siwar and Yusof Kasim, 1997; De Janvry and Sadoulet, 2000; Cheng et al., 2002).====The rest of this article is organized as follows: Section 2 contents the theoretical framework of this article.

We use the contingent valuation method to estimate the costs to drivers of Beijing’s driving restrictions program, one of the world’s largest. Our study generates three main findings. First, costs are substantial: RMB 356 to 709 (US $54 to $107) per driver per year, which represents 0.5 to 1 percent of annual income, and RMB 1.6 billion to 3.3 billion (US $247 million to $493 million) per year for all drivers. Second, comparison of our cost estimates with estimates of the benefits of Beijing’s program from other studies suggests that the benefits exceed the costs. Finally, the costs per driver are significantly smaller than the costs (estimated using the same methods) of Mexico City’s program, which by most accounts has had zero benefits. These findings provide some of the strongest evidence to date that driving restrictions programs can, given certain conditions, have net benefits. They also suggest that relatively high program costs are not a necessary condition for significant program benefits—in fact, the opposite may be true.","The world’s vehicle stock is projected to more than double between 2010 and 2030, mostly because of rapid growth in China, India and other developing countries (Sperling and Gordon, 2009). Although rapid motorization in the Global South has generated benefits, it also has had serious environmental consequences, particularly in urban areas. It has become a leading cause of air pollution, traffic congestion, and greenhouse gas emissions (Timilsina and Dulal, 2008; Pachauri and Reisinger, 2007).====An increasingly popular policy response is to ban the driving of vehicles with license plates ending in certain numbers on certain days. Typically, each car is banned one weekday per week and one Saturday per month. Three decades ago, city planners in Buenos Aires initiated the first large-scale driving restrictions program based on license plate numbers (De Grange and Troncoso, 2011). Since then, this approach has been replicated in many other developing-country megacities, including Beijing, Bogotá, Changchun, Chengdou, Delhi, La Paz, Mexico City, Medellin, Quito, São Paulo, Santiago, San José, and Tegucigalpa. Tens of millions of people now live in urban areas with driving restrictions based on license plate numbers.====Emerging evidence on the benefits of these programs is decidedly mixed.==== Studies of programs in Mexico City and Bogotá find that they either have had no significant effects on air pollution and congestion or have actually exacerbated these problems because drivers have adapted by shifting trips to unrestricted hours and purchasing additional cars, often old and dirty ones (Bonilla, 2019; Davis, 2008; Eskeland and Feyziouglu, 1997; Gallego et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2017). But studies of programs in Beijing, Quito, and Santiago find some evidence for long-term benefits (Carillo et al., 2016; De Grange and Troncoso, 2011; Lu, 2016; Sun et al., 2014; Viard and Fu, 2015).====Given the mixed evidence on the ==== of driving restrictions programs, it is important to generate the second type of data policymakers need to decide whether to retain, replicate, and refine these programs: reliable estimates of the ==== that these programs impose on drivers. The seemingly most straightforward strategy for estimating these costs would be to use an averting-expenditures approach—that is, to tally the pecuniary costs that households pay to adapt to driving restrictions, including costs associated with using public transportation and buying additional vehicles. But this approach has three significant drawbacks. First, it would do a poor job of estimating difficult-to-measure nonpecuniary costs—including inconvenience costs and the opportunity costs of lost time—that may well dominate pecuniary costs. For example, taking public transportation one day a week instead of driving might cause significant inconvenience and require an individual to spend several additional hours commuting and rearranging trips. An averting-expenditure approach would neglect such inconvenience costs and could provide only a coarse estimate of the opportunity costs of lost time (unless detailed household-level survey data on time allocation were collected).====Second, an averting-expenditures approach would be problematic if the strategies that households use to adapt to driving restrictions are complex, subtle, and therefore difficult to price. Anecdotal evidence suggests this is often the case, particularly when driving restrictions programs have intricate rules. For example, in Mexico City, program rules were changed to exempt relatively new vehicles in 1996. As a result, turnover of used vehicles has accelerated since 1996. An averting-expenditures approach would require estimating this acceleration and tallying its additional cost. On its face, this would be a challenging task.====Finally, an averting-expenditures approach would generate biased results if such expenditures had significant benefits independent of driving restrictions. For example, a household’s purchase of an additional vehicle enables its members to drive more often than they otherwise would. This ancillary benefit would need to be valued and subtracted from the cost of the additional vehicle, an inherently difficult enterprise.====Following Blackman et al. (2018a), we use a contingent valuation (CV) method to estimate the social costs of driving restrictions in Beijing. Typically used to value nonmarket environmental and health-related goods such as clean air, scenic beauty, and avoided illness (e.g., Carson et al., 2003; Krupnick et al., 2002), a CV survey describes a policy intervention that would generate a marginal increase in the good—for example, a program to improve surface water quality—and asks a representative sample of respondents questions about their willingness to pay (WTP) for that intervention. Survey responses are then used to calculate total WTP for the intervention. We adapt this method to measuring the costs of Beijing’s driving restrictions by developing a CV survey that describes a permit program that would exempt individuals from driving restrictions, and we administer it to a representative sample of drivers. We use their responses to calculate the total WTP for avoiding restrictions, which is a measure of the cost of the restrictions. As discussed at the end of Section 4, our approach estimates the annual costs that driving restrictions imposed on drivers in 2016 net of any costs incurred before 2016, including the costs of past adaptation measures related to, for example, moving closer to public transportation. To shed light on the policy implications of our cost estimates, we compare them with estimates of the benefits of Beijing’s driving restrictions program (from Viard and Fu, 2015) and with estimates of the costs of Mexico City’s program (from Blackman et al., 2018a).====Our study makes three main contributions. To our knowledge, it is the first to develop a rigorous estimate of the costs of Beijing’s driving restrictions program, one of the world’s largest in terms of the number of vehicles affected. Relatedly, it contributes to the emerging literature (cited above) that sheds light on the conditions and contexts under which driving restrictions are likely to have net benefits. And finally, to our knowledge, it is only study other than Blackman et al. (2018a) to focus directly on using stated preference methods to isolate and estimate the private costs of an existing environmental regulation.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The second section presents background on Beijing’s driving restrictions program and briefly reviews studies of its benefits. The third section presents our analytical framework. The fourth section describes our CV instrument and its administration. The fifth section presents our results, and the sixth section discusses them.

Using novel microdata on on-road fuel consumption in Japan, we find a discontinuous increase in the fuel economy gap—the disparity between official test results and real-world fuel economy—of 6 percent at the tax-incentive eligibility thresholds. Further evidence suggests that much of the observed gap remains unexplained by driver or vehicle characteristics, and that no gap is observed at similar levels of fuel economy when they are not tied to the large tax-incentive eligibility. Our findings suggest that feebates, large incentive schemes based on fuel economy levels, may in turn incentivize automakers to “cook the books” on fuel economy figures.","The illicit manipulation of fuel economy and related emission data on the part of the automobile industry has recently garnered substantial public attention.==== While individual cases vary in nature and magnitude, investigations of their underlying causes and impacts have been impeded by the absence of tools which would enable researchers to collect and monitor systematic quantitative data regarding distorted fuel economy figures, as well as the absence of credible research designs to establish causality.====In this study, we overcome these two obstacles by utilizing novel microdata on on-road fuel consumption in a quasi-experimental research design that offers causal inference. In particular, we focus on cases from 2016 in which automakers in Japan have falsified fuel economy figures in order to shed light on two phenomena: (1) the incentives that induced automakers to manipulate data regarding fuel economy, and (2) the extent to which the resulting data have distorted compliance with current environmental policies. To address these questions, we consider the feebate policy in Japan since 2009. With the aim of promoting fuel-efficient vehicles, the policy provided massive tax incentives to vehicle purchasers based on fuel economy. These tax incentives have boosted demand for eligible vehicles and therefore induced the automakers to inflate the fuel economy of their vehicles to meet the eligibility thresholds. We examine whether and to what extent these tax incentives give rise to a so-called “fuel economy gap,” which is the disparity between test results and what is actually achieved on the road.====Our study finds both that there is a large fuel economy gap and that this gap exhibits significant increases at the eligibility thresholds. On average, while real-world fuel economy is about 21.6 percent lower than the officially reported test data for ineligible vehicles below the eligibility thresholds, the fuel economy gap for eligible vehicles exhibits a discontinuous increase of 6.0 percent at the eligibility cutoffs. Perhaps most interestingly from an economics perspective, the point estimates illustrate a suggestive pattern of larger discontinuities in fuel economy gaps at eligibility thresholds associated with greater marginal tax incentives, while the differences in individual point estimates are not statistically different from each other, suggesting that the automakers rationalize their manipulation efforts on the basis of expected returns on sales ====. While we find great heterogeneity in the fuel economy gap across automakers, the extent estimated for Mitsubishi is commensurate with what was revealed by the company executives during a press conference in April 2016. Our findings offer among the first evidence that feebates, the large incentive schemes with nonlinear schedules based on fuel economy figures, create incentives on the part of the automobile industry to “cook the books” on fuel economy figures by exploiting existing legal laxity and potentially illegally falsifying data.====Our results are pertinent to contentious debates among economists and policymakers over the efficacy of a variety of policy schemes aimed at improving automobile fuel economy and curbing greenhouse gas emissions.==== Policy schemes based on fuel economy figures, e.g. fuel economy standards, taxes, subsidies, or scrappage programs, are very popular around the world.==== Existing studies show that these policies have effectively increased the demand for and market share of fuel-economical vehicles and have contributed to improvements in official fuel economy.====However, such policy schemes are also likely to induce behavioral distortions as economic agents form incentives to game the system. Recent studies have documented evidence that vehicles were redesigned to comply with the fuel economy standards (Knittel, 2011; Klier and Linn, 2012; Sallee and Slemrod, 2012; Ito and Sallee, 2018; Bento et al., 2017; and Whitefoot et al., 2017). These responses reflect strategic and legitimate behaviors that do not necessarily give rise to a discontinuous fuel economy gap at eligibility thresholds.====This study makes a unique contribution by focusing on a fuel economy gap at the eligibility threshold that arises only from distinct mechanisms of a potentially illicit nature, namely cheating fuel economy figures on the producer's side, a topic that has garnered increasing policy interest in recent years.==== A series of recent scandals exposing automakers' manipulation of fuel economy and emission data have revealed that various loopholes in vehicle testing procedures have allowed manufacturers to game opportunities for optimizing the results, as discussed in more detail in Section IV.D.====Our analysis provides two methodological advantages and an excellent case to study the extent of the distorted fuel economy figures and the underlying incentives for their manipulation. First, we observe a large set of high-frequency on-the-road fuel consumption microdata obtained directly from regular drivers through a unique mobile phone application at every refueling level. The data set also identifies configurations of vehicles at the exact level at which a unique value of official fuel economy is designated, allowing us to compute the fuel economy gap with a rare level of precision. Since the pioneering work by Schipper and Tax (1994), some quantitative evidence used anecdotally has documented the existence and even growth of gaps between fuel consumption in real-world driving and officially reported performance.==== However, the gap can naturally arise and grow over time due to differences between testing cycles and individual driving conditions, and therefore the mechanism to explain the gap remains little understood (Anderson and Sallee, 2016). Our investigation into the magnitude and cause of the fuel economy gap based on a more systematic quantitative analysis is therefore important, relatively new, and unique.====Second, our research design, which compares eligible and ineligible vehicles locally in the neighborhood of the eligibility thresholds that were exogenously established and varied over time, allows us to discard a number of channels that would otherwise explain a fuel economy gap. In particular, our identification assumption is that no other factors—other than the large tax incentives and factors that can be controlled for by a flexible underlying function of the running variable—explain an increased fuel economy gap at the thresholds. We present a variety of placebo evidence that supports the identification assumption, which suggests the absence of a discontinuity in the fuel economy gap (1) at the tax-incentive eligibility thresholds before 2009, when the sizes of the tax incentives were small, and (2) at the levels of fuel economy since 2009, which defined large tax-incentive eligibility in one period for vehicles produced in another period, during which these levels were not tied to the tax-incentive eligibility. These findings are difficult to reconcile with an alternative explanation unrelated to the regulation. Further, we show that a number of driver characteristics do not differ across the thresholds in a systematic way that could possibly account for the observed fuel economy gap, whereas some vehicle characteristics are shown to explain some of the observed gap, highlighting mechanisms through which fuel economy can be inflated. Nevertheless, much remains unexplained, leaving the potential for illicit manipulation.====Our study is closely related to, yet differs from, contemporary work by Reynaert and Sallee (2018) in four important dimensions. First, our analysis associates the fuel economy gap with a feebate policy, which differs from the fuel economy standards examined in Reynaert and Sallee (2018). While economic analyses typically conclude that market-based approaches are much more efficient than traditional fuel economy standards at influencing consumer behavior and achieving pollution reductions, feebate policies are relatively new and are considered among the most promising policy schemes because unlike taxes, they provide a visible price signal at the time of purchase, while the largest impact is expected from manufacturer innovation in the long-run (the International Council on Clean Transportation, 2010a; International Energy Agency, 2012; and APEC Energy Working Group, 2018). Our finding that feebate systems, especially those with nonlinear payoff schedules, are substantially less effective than what is expected in reducing fuel consumption has important policy implications for the increasing number of countries that are implementing similar programs.====Second, our empirical strategy is established on the discontinuous nature of eligibility thresholds over the official fuel economy figure, while Reynaert and Sallee (2018) rely on temporal changes. Importantly, the fuel economy gap is observed to mechanically widen as levels of fuel economy increase, rendering the identification of its cause based on temporal changes difficult.====Third, our data measure actual fuel economy for regular drivers driving their own vehicles for daily purposes, while the measure employed by Reynaert and Sallee (2018) is based on fuel consumption paid by employers for their corporate vehicles also provided by employers. Lastly, we analyze potential mechanisms for automakers to game the system, which the earlier study did not.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section II describes the feebate policy in Japan and introduces our unique data. Section III explains the econometric framework. Section IV discusses the results, an extensive set of robustness checks, mechanisms, and heterogeneity in the treatment effect.

The decision to engage in mangrove planting requires trading off the short-run costs of planting with its long-run benefits. We report a lab-in-the-field experiment with Thai coastal villagers in which we elicit short- and long-run time preferences prior to mangrove-seed planting. We show that less present-biased participants plant more seeds, while planting is unrelated to individuals’ future discounting. Our results contribute to the debate on whether present bias is positively or negatively related to conservation behavior by showing a positive relation in a replenishment act.","Sustainable resource management is a key policy goal, both at the local and the global level. It requires policy makers to take far-sighted decisions now with consequences in the very long-run. It is equally challenging at the individual level because conserving natural resources not only asks individuals to forego a personal profit for the benefit of the public good but also to incur costs today in order to reap benefits that will arise much later in time. Ever since the classic work of Hotelling (1931), social discount rates have therefore been a key ingredient in resource economics (e.g., Solow, 1974; Farzin, 1984). For example, they are typically used in cost-benefit analysis of environmental policies (Tietenberg and Lewis, 2016). Despite the intertemporal nature of conservation, less attention has been devoted towards the role of individual time preferences for understanding conservation behavior.====Starting with Newell and Siikamäki (2015), a growing literature is concerned with explaining the “energy efficiency gap”, the systematically lower level of energy efficiency compared to the cost-minimizing level (Alcott and Greenstone, 2012). They and others (Allcott and Taubinsky, 2015; Bradford et al., 2017; Fuerst and Singh, 2018; Schleich et al., 2019) find evidence that more patient individuals invest more into and are more likely to adopt energy-efficient technologies. While energy efficiency investments have positive externalities and indirectly contribute to the maintenance of natural resources, they also have a salient and immediate private benefit: reductions in energy cost.====Regarding the direct conservation of natural resources and without these immediate private benefits, early studies relied on an elicitation of time preferences through hypothetical scenarios and on self-reported behavior. They found that impatience is associated with increased self-reported violations of fishing regulations (Akpalu, 2008) and with higher self-reported extraction of forest resources (Gunatilake et al., 2012). Johnson and Saunders (2014) measure time preferences based on incentivized experiments for two different groups of marine resource users: fishermen and (tourist) divers. They find that discount factors and present-biasedness can predict stated management preferences only to a limited extent.====Only a few studies measure actual conservation behavior, but report inconclusive results. Fehr and Leibbrandt (2011; FL henceforth) study the relation between conservation behavior of Brazilian fishermen and their patience as well as their cooperation in a public good experiment. Note that FL use the word “patience” rather than “present bias” because the proxy might capture both present bias and future discounting. We follow this notation. Their proxy for patience is a variant of the “Marshmallow Test” (Mischel et al., 1972): a fisherman’s decision between a smaller amount of consumption goods now (at the beginning of the experiment) and a larger amount of the same goods 2 hours later (after the experiment). FL use the mesh size of the fishing net or the hole size of the bottle that is used to catch shrimp as a proxy for a fisherman’s conservation behavior. The larger the mesh size and the larger the holes in a bottle, the easier it is for small and infertile fish or shrimp to escape and reproduce in the future. FL find a positive correlation between cooperation in a public goods experiment and actual conservation behavior. More importantly for our research interest, they also find that patience is positively correlated to conservation behavior: the more patient a fisherman the larger is the mesh or hole size he uses. This finding is in line with classical economic theory, as more patient individuals place a higher value onto the future and are therefore more willing to act in a sustainable way.====Torres-Guevara and Schlüter (2016; TGS henceforth) investigate extraction decisions of Colombian male fishermen and report differing results. They measure patience similar to FL and additionally measure future discount rates by asking fishermen to choose between a smaller amount in one week and a larger amount in two weeks. Their proxy for extraction behavior is a fisherman-specific fishing impact index, in which they take into account fishing instruments, methods and spots. TGS find only weak evidence for a relation between time preferences and extraction. If at all, they find that ==== fishermen ====. TGS speculate that this may result from a behavioral version of a “disinvestment effect” (Farzin, 1984): more patient fishermen are able to save more and can therefore better invest in more effective fishing instruments that extract more fish. Javaid et al. (2016) provide further evidence along these lines: Fishermen in Zanzibar who are more patient in a time-preference experiment extract – based on self-reports – more fish.====Although the disinvestment effect may explain behavior in the contexts of TGS and Javaid et al. (2016), it seems less plausible in the context of FL. There, fishermen use rather basic fishing gear (simple nets and shrimp traps manufactured from used PET bottles) and investments in more capital-intensive fishing gear seem unnecessary or at least uncommon. This suggests that the two findings (‘patient fishermen allow more fish to reproduce’ and ‘patient fishermen extract more fish’) are not as opposed as they first seem: How sustainably an individual uses resources often depends not only on her extraction behavior but also on her replenishment behavior. It might well be that patient individuals at the same time extract more and replenish more, making the overall effect on conservation ambiguous. Thus, patience and conservation behavior may be negatively related when the proxy to measure the latter captures extraction (as in TGS and Javaid et al., 2016) and positively when the measure leans more towards replenishment (as in FL). Hence, an important step in settling the debate on the relation between patience and conservation behavior is to isolate replenishment from extraction.====In this paper, we present the first study focusing on pure replenishment behavior: fishermen planting ==== (mangrove) seeds. Planting mangroves in tropical tidal areas benefits the future environment by providing nursery for aquatic animals, helping to prevent soil erosion and reducing carbon dioxide, and therefore sustaining the basis for fishing activities (see Kathiresan and Bingham, 2001). Importantly, different than in FL and TGS, our task does not involve any extraction of resources and does not provide any short-run benefits. Mangrove planting is a pure replenishment act with long-run communal benefits. This design allows us to clearly separate replenishment from extraction. We measure the number of seeds planted in public coastal areas by Thai coastal villagers and relate this to their time preferences. We use the convex time budget method (see Andreoni; Sprenger, 2012) to elicit time preferences by asking participants to allocate a given budget between two dates. The more a participant allocates to the later date, the higher is his or her payoff. We varied the timespan between the dates (time frames) and the interest rates for payoffs at the later dates.====Our study distinguishes from the two previous studies that measure actual conservation behavior in further important ways. In contrast to FL and TGS, we elicit both future discount rates and present-biasedness in order to distinguish between two important motives for not acting in a sustainable manner: (1) because the individual cares little about the future (has a high discount rate), and/or (2) because the individual cares about the future environment but is tempted to reap immediate benefits or avoid immediate costs (is present-biased). To differentiate between present-biasedness and the future discount rate is important because they imply different actions for policy makers aiming to foster sustainable resource management. Commitment devices can be effective means to reduce the present-biasedness in individuals’ choices (see for example Ariely; Wertenbroch, 2002; Ashraf et al., 2006). For instance, local governments might design a mechanism that allows resource users to make a public pledge now for their future contributions to conserve resources. By contrast, it is less clear how to lower individual discount rates. Lowering individual discount rates may require increasing the subjective level of physical and economic security (Ostrom, 1990; Alló and Loureiro, 2018). Lastly, while the relevant previous studies focus on extraction behavior by male fishermen only, the nature of the mangrove planting task allows us to observe ==== decisions ==== and without measurement error of both female and male villagers of a wide range of ages.====We find that less present-biased (and therefore more patient) participants plant more mangroves and that planting decisions are unrelated to long-run time preferences. Thus, when focusing on replenishment, patience has a positive effect. This result is in line with the findings of FL and provides support for the hypothesis that patience increases conservation behavior in case the activity has a strong replenishment character.",Field evidence on the role of time preferences in conservation behavior,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069620300917,23 August 2020,2020,Research Article,216.0

This paper applies a boundary discontinuity design to a residential sorting model to provide novel estimates of sorting across flood risk by race, ethnicity, and income. We find clear evidence that low income and minority residents are more likely to move into high risk flood zones. We then highlight the overall and distributional implications of proposed price and information reforms to the U.S. National ==== Program. While such reforms are likely welfare increasing overall, heterogeneous behavioral responses yield significant distributive effects that also alter the composition of residents in harm's way.","Scholars and policy makers have long been concerned with how individuals locate relative to environmental hazards such as natural disasters. Residential patterns surrounding disaster risk can have critical consequences for many economic outcomes including household finance, economic growth, and migration (Strobl, 2011; Hornbeck, 2012; Cavallo et al., 2013; Gallagher and Hartley, 2017) as well as public programs for emergency management, welfare, and insurance (Michel-Kerjan, 2010; Deryugina, 2017). While a rich literature has estimated household preferences to avoid such risks, a longstanding challenge to empirical identification is the correlation between disaster risk and spatial amenities. In addition, an open question surrounds the potential for sorting based on socioeconomic status that, if present, can lead to unintended and unwanted distributional consequences including from benevolently-intentioned public policies.====This paper provides novel empirical evidence on sorting across disaster risk and highlights implications for policy reform. Using the case of flood risk in South Florida, we first estimate a discrete choice residential sorting model with three innovations on the flood risk literature. Compared with the hedonic price model predominately employed in existing studies, our approach (i) allows for sorting over flood risk by homebuyer race, ethnicity, and income, (ii) accounts for property-specific insurance pricing that could otherwise confound analysis, and (iii) employs a boundary discontinuity identification strategy (Black, 1999) within our sorting model (Bayer et al., 2007) to deal with the endogeneity of disaster risk and spatial attributes. Our results provide the first estimates of sorting over flood risk by socioeconomic characteristics.====Second, we investigate the potential consequences of sorting for policy reform. We estimate the welfare and distributional consequences of changes in prices and flood risk information faced by households under the U.S. National Flood Insurance Program. In particular, using the structural parameters from our sorting model, we estimate the compensating variation for different race, ethnicity, and income groups from a (counterfactual) removal of the program's three largest insurance price discount schemes, and predict the resulting reallocation of household types across flood risk zones. In addition, we assess the value of risk information using new flood risk maps released by the National Flood Insurance Program. We then compare these benefits to the costs of map revisions.====We find clear evidence that individuals are willing to pay to avoid flood risk, as homes located just inside a high risk flood zone sell at a 6.3 percent discount relative to those just outside. Ignoring correlated amenities and insurance price discounts implies that high risk homes sell at a premium. Second, low income and minority residents are more likely to sort into high flood risk areas. This sorting takes place, even though high income, white residents tend to be concentrated in high risk coastal zones, likely driven by the amenity value associated with flood risk (e.g., Kahn and Smith (2017)).==== In addition to furthering our understanding of residential location choice around environmental risk, the presence of sorting reaffirms the established result that housing price capitalization effects, estimated from hedonic price models, should be interpreted with care as they may combine preferences to avoid flood risk with changes in the implicit prices of flood risk and other co-existing amenities due to sorting (Kuminoff et al., 2010; Kuminoff and Pope, 2014; Bakkensen and Barrage, 2017).====Policy changes can also have important distributional consequences in the presence of sorting based on socioeconomic status. In our setting, the costs of insurance price reform fall more heavily on low income residents as a fraction of income. Resulting re-sorting would then lead to a greater concentration of low income and minority residents in harm's way. While policy reform may well be a desirable goal, these distributional impacts could have potentially long lasting implications for disaster vulnerability, recovery, and fiscal policy (Arrow et al., 1996; Robinson et al., 2016; Banzhaf et al., 2019).====Despite distributional costs, society may still realize large efficiency gains from reforms overall. We find that household welfare costs from insurance price reforms are significantly lower relative to costs estimated from an analysis that assumes no re-sorting, with expected welfare loss experienced by these households to be, on average, only 18.5 percent of the price discount that was removed. Importantly for disaster resilience and recovery, we find that higher insurance prices would lead to fewer individuals living in high risk zones, highlighting that migration will likely be an important (albeit costly) channel to mitigate climate risks. In addition, we find that flood risk map updates are valuable sources of information and are appealing from both a distributional and efficiency perspective. Depending on the quality of old versus new maps, we estimate a benefit cost ratio of 7.3 from map revisions, and find benefits more greatly concentrated among low income individuals. Understanding sorting over flood risk and the implications for policy is critical as flooding remains one of the costliest and deadliest types of natural disasters around the world, and impacts are expected to increase significantly under a changing climate (Hallegatte et al., 2013; Smith and Katz, 2013).====The paper proceeds as follows.

This suggests that temperature plays an important role in high-stakes cognitive performance and has potentially far-reaching impacts for the careers and lifetime earnings of students.","The planet is expected to warm considerably over the coming century as a result of climate change, driving up average temperatures and shifting the climate toward greater and more frequent temperature extremes. The threat of global warming has spawned a sizable corpus of economic research that explores the impacts of temperature on a wide range of outcomes.==== One area that has been comparatively underexplored, but which touches many aspects of our everyday lives, is the impacts on cognitive performance.====In principal, environmental conditions could impact cognitive performance vis-à-vis a number of inter-related channels. The brain’s chemistry, electrical properties and function are all temperature sensitive (Bowler and Tirri, 1974; Schiff and Somjen, 1985; Deboer, 1998; Yablonskiy et al., 2000; Hocking et al., 2001). Moreover, exposure to heat has been shown to diminish attention, memory, information retention and processing, and the performance of psycho-perceptual tasks (Hyde et al., 1997; Hocking et al., 2001; Vasmatzidis et al., 2002). The impacts of thermal stress on working memory performance are especially relevant as cognitively challenging tasks rely heavily on the working memory for multi-step processing.====In this paper, we provide the first nation-wide estimates of the impacts of temperature on high-stakes cognitive performance in a developing country using data from the National College Entrance Examination (NCEE), or ====, in China. The NCEE offers a useful means of examining the effect of heat on cognitive performance for several reasons. It is one of the most important institutional features of admissions to post-secondary education in China and affects the lives of millions of families (Bai et al., 2014; Chen and Onur Kesten, 2017; Jia and Li, 2017; Cai et al., 2019). Each year, around 9 million students take the exam to compete for admission to around 2300 colleges and universities. Unlike other countries which rely upon standardized tests along with other factors such as high-school GPA, extracurricular activities, and recommendation letters to determine college admissions, the NCEE is almost the sole determinant for college admission in China,==== making it an extremely high-stakes exam. This is especially true for those aiming for the top-tier universities, as graduates can expect, on average, to earn 40% more per month than their counterparts from lesser universities (Jia and Li, 2017). The competition is fierce. Though the overall admission rate of test takers to college or university has been around 75% in recent years, the admission rate for the roughly 100 first-tier universities in China is only 12% (China Education Online, 2016).====Several other features of the NCEE make it particularly well-suited for measuring the causal effects of temperature on cognitive performance. First, the date of the NCEE is fixed, on June 7th and 8th, making self-selection on test dates impossible. Second, because the NCEE is held only once a year, the cost of retaking the exam is quite high, essentially requiring students to repeat an additional year of high school. Third, during our sample period of 2005–2011, students were required to take the exam in the same county as their household registration (====). Therefore, self-selection on exam locations is heavily regulated. Finally, air conditioning is not available at testing facilities,==== thereby eliminating a potentially endogenous adaptation strategy, and providing a better simulacrum of the conditions under which cognitive tasks are performed throughout the developing world where air conditioning penetration is quite low.====To examine the impact of temperature on the NCEE performance, we obtained a unique dataset that covers the universe of students from 2227 counties who were admitted into college between 2005 and 2011 across China, yielding more than 14 million observations. The dataset reports the exam scores (ranging from 0 to 750) and exam counties for each student. We then match this dataset with daily weather data on temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, wind speed, sunshine duration, pressure, and visibility from 752 weather stations spread across the entire country.====We find both economically and statistically significant negative effects of temperature on test scores. In particular, a one-standard-deviation increase in temperature during the exam period within counties (2 °C/3.6 °F) decreases total test scores by 0.68%, or approximately 6 percent of one standard deviation in test performance. The effects are roughly linear in the temperature range found in China during early June – mean temperature during the exam period is 23.21 °C (73.78 °F). Given the significant negative effect of temperature on exam scores, we then turn our attention to the effects of temperature on whether a student’s score is above the cutoff for the first-tier universities.==== Since we do not have data on college admission, we proxy top-tier university admissions based on obtaining a score higher than the cutoff. We find that a one-standard-deviation increase in temperature within counties decreases the probability of getting into first-tier universities by 1.2 percent. Together, these results indicate that temperature plays an important role in high-stakes cognitive performance and has potentially far-reaching impacts for the careers and lifetime earnings of students.====In the Chinese context, hotter regions may be unfairly penalized by the current system, and climate change is expected to exacerbate these inequalities. We believe that one policy response to remedy this injustice is to install and use air conditioning in the exam rooms to help protect against the harmful effects of heat and level the playing field across regions which vary considerably in their average summertime temperatures.====This paper builds upon a small and recent body of economics literature that examines the impacts of temperature on cognitive performance in a developed country context in which air conditioning is far more prevalent and the ramifications from underperforming on a test are significantly less consequential. Graff Zivin et al. (2018) find modest and statistically significant impacts of warmer temperatures on low-stakes test performance administered in U.S. homes as part of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. Park (forthcoming) exploits data from a higher-stakes environment – New York City high school exit exams – and finds similar results.==== Our results from China, which imply that a 1 °C increase in temperature during the exam period decreases total test scores by 2.91% of a standard deviation, is approximately twice as large as the impacts estimated by these studies based in the U.S. Our study also complements recent work by Garg et al. (2018), which finds that increases in annual temperature exposure in India can impair test performance largely through impacts on agricultural yields and nutrition.====Thus, the key contribution of our work is the focus on high-stakes testing (arguably the highest in the world) on a national sample in a developing country at a temporal scale that allows us to disentangle direct cognitive impairments from other potential channels. Our findings also have important implications for the study of standardized test performance more generally. While these tests are often viewed as the gold standard for assessing the academic competence of students (Koretz and Deibert, 1995; Robelen, 2002; US Legal, 2014), recent studies have shown that the time the test is given as well as local air pollution can impact performance (Sievertsen et al., 2016; Ebenstein et al., 2016).

This reliance has energized the debate about the appropriate levels of taxation that balance the desire to fund public goods through resource rent with the need to create incentives to extract valuable resources (Rabe and Hampton, 2015; Newell and Raimi, 2018). This problem is made more complicated because extraction firms can invest in multiple jurisdictions with spatially-varying tax rates (Maniloff and Manning, 2017). Despite the prevalence of spatially variable tax rates (e.g., across US states), theoretical models of natural resources use often assume a single tax rate and that firms respond to taxes and prices equally. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that resource extraction firms respond differently to local tax changes than global price changes in a multi-jurisdictional nonrenewable resource setting. Failing to account for this difference can lead to biased estimates of the impact of tax policies on resource use and government revenues.====Describing the impacts of resource taxation over time is a core contribution of resource economics (Hotelling, 1931; Pindyck, 1978; Kolstad and Wolak Jr, 1983; Yücel, 1989a, Yücel, 1989b). The nonrenewable resource economics literature has explored the impact of taxation on oil production (Rao, 2018), drilling (Anderson et al., 2018), exploration (Kunce, 2003), economic efficiency (Deacon, 1993), and growth (Groth and Schou, 2007). Spatially-explicit taxation of natural resources has been explored in the context of groundwater (Kuwayama and Brozović, 2013) and fisheries (Sanchirico and James, 2005), although typically in the context of a single regulator. The literature on resource taxation across multiple jurisdictions is much smaller. For example, Maniloff and Manning (2017) numerically describe how state-specific taxation can affect the timing and location of extraction from several states with oil reserves.====While Li et al. (2014) provide evidence that consumers adjust resource consumption differently in response to prices and taxes, models of firm behavior typically assume optimization based on the net-of-tax output price (Metcalf, 2018). In this paper, we theoretically and empirically examine how oil extraction firm investment decisions respond to changes in output prices and production taxes, allowing for differential responses to national or global oil prices and state-level taxes. Differential responses to price and tax incentives derive from differences in the spatial scale at which the incentives vary. In the context studied here, the common price of oil is a global incentive to drill, while a state-level tax is a local (dis)incentive to drill.==== The existing literature typically examines price and tax incentives while assuming that they vary at the same spatial scale, either globally (Metcalf, 2018) or locally (Rao, 2018). Our approach suggests that drilling responses to similar incentives are not equivalent if producers can make location decisions for extraction and the incentives vary at different spatial scales, whether these are policy jurisdictions or economies in which markets clear. Generally, we think of oil markets as having a common shared price because oil is highly storable and has low transportation costs, but regional prices can decouple (EIA, 2011). Our results for local incentives can be informative when resource markets are fragmented or when resources cover multiple policy jurisdictions. The distinction between local and global incentives is also important for climate change policy, particularly as U.S. states and Canadian provinces pursue their own carbon pricing (Murray and Rivers, 2015; Yamazaki, 2017; Fell and Peter, 2018).====Our empirical exercise is motivated by a theoretical model that demonstrates that changes in location-specific tax rates affect firms in qualitatively different ways than changes in output price. While both price and tax changes affect the revenue earned from drilling in a given state, our theoretical model of extraction firm capital allocation over multiple regions shows that a price change also affects the opportunity cost of drilling and leads to a different net effect.====Econometrically, we identify the impact of oil tax changes on resource firm extraction decisions and confirm that the responsiveness of oil drilling to taxes differs from the responsiveness to price. Our identification strategy utilizes border discontinuity and underlying nonrenewable resource stocks, similar to Boslett et al. (2016) and Balthrop and Schnier (2016). We find that firms respond inelastically to changes in tax rates, though the response to a one-dollar increase in tax per unit of production is larger than the response to an equivalent price decrease. This difference is economically and statistically significant. We also find no evidence of spillovers across state lines in response to tax changes.====For identification of the tax effect, we exploit the interaction of cross-state variation in tax rates with temporal variation in oil prices. The intuition is that when oil prices increase, drilling increases, but it increases more in a state with a low tax rate than in a state with a high tax rate because the increase in tax paid per unit of production increases by less in the low-tax state. After controlling for other state characteristics, the differential increase in tax per unit of production is our key identifying variation.====We make two contributions to the literature on taxation and resource exploitation. First, we estimate how oil drilling responds to oil prices and severance taxes. Using 30 years of spatially explicit data on drilling in 91 reservoirs across 17 oil-producing states, we show that a one dollar decrease in tax leads to at least an 8 percent increase in wells drilled. This is larger than our estimate of the effect of a change in price. Second, we provide a theoretical basis for the finding that local tax changes have a larger effect than global price changes.====While our estimates do not account for the long-run supply response to prices or taxes, they provide valuable information about how investment in the extraction of a nonrenewable resource responds to changes in state tax policy. We show that the response to a change in tax paid per barrel of oil is inelastic, implying that an increase in the tax rate per barrel leads to increases in tax revenue. The policy implication is that reductions in severance taxes are likely to increase drilling. However, it will also likely decrease severance tax revenue because the increase in drilling is not large enough to offset the loss in revenue from taxing at a lower rate. Crucially, failing to allow differential price and tax impacts may significantly underestimate the impact of tax changes in settings where the spatial scales of price and tax differ. This can produce misleading information about resource policy impacts when resource users have many potential locations for resource extraction.====In the remainder of this paper, Section 2 reviews the relevant literature on taxation, investment, and oil production. Section 3 describes a theoretical model of industry drilling decisions using a 2-location model. Section 4 begins with a description of a cross-border empirical strategy estimating the effect of severance taxes on drilling in the same state. The data are described in Section 4.1 while results are presented in Section 4.2. Section 4.3 provides evidence that highly localized spatial spillovers are small. Section 5 provides a back-of-the-envelope calculation that demonstrates the implications of our elasticity estimates for state government revenue.

The assumption of uncorrelated random coefficients leads to a specific and restricted correlation structure of the willingness-to-pay (WTP) values (Train and Weeks, 2005) and a fixed scale across individuals (Hess and Rose, 2012; Hess and Train, 2017). The practitioners applying this RPL model usually cite McFadden and Train (2000) work to justify their model choice, as it shows that any choice model, with any distribution of preferences, can be approximated to any degree of accuracy by a mixed logit model and its most widely used derivation, based on random coefficients. However, this is not true if the assumed variance−covariance matrix of the utility coefficients in the RPL is diagonal, as is the case in an RPL model with uncorrelated utility coefficients.====A more flexible version, the RPL model with correlated utility coefficients, is used less frequently, probably due to different issues related to the estimation (local maxima) and non-trivial interpretation. The correlation matrix of the utility coefficients captures not only the correlation of the random parameters but also the correlation caused by scale heterogeneity, and these two effects cannot be identified empirically (Hess and Train, 2017).====Indeed, the RPL model with correlated coefficients is closely related to the widely discussed topic of scale heterogeneity. As stressed by Hess and Rose (2012), scale heterogeneity cannot be identified separately from other sources of heterogeneity and represents a specific type of correlation among utility coefficients. Scale heterogeneity is usually introduced in the literature as the influence of unobserved factors on an individual's choices, which can differ between them. An individual's choices can mainly be determined by the included factors and thus are less influenced by unobserved heterogeneity, leading to utility coefficients that are large in magnitude. On the contrary, the choices influenced mainly by unincluded factors are expected to be small in magnitude. This is called scale heterogeneity, because the scale of the specific utility differs between individuals. For some individuals, all their coefficients are larger (or smaller) than their corresponding means and are therefore correlated.====However, the correlation between utility coefficients can also appear due to behavioural phenomena. For example, people who support flora protection can also be supportive of fauna protection, creating a positive correlation between random flora and fauna coefficients. On the contrary, people who support flora protection can disapprove of the building of new recreational parks, creating a negative correlation between the random coefficients of fauna and recreational parks.====The RPL models with full correlation among utility coefficients allow for all sources of correlation, including both scale heterogeneity and heterogeneity due to behavioural phenomena. These sources, however, cannot be empirically disentangled in any model. The RPL models with correlated random parameters require the estimation of a significantly higher number of parameters and thus increase not only the computation time but also the risk of local maxima. The estimation of the full variance–covariance matrix of the random coefficient can also increase the number of estimated parameters to the point that simulation-based methods become impractical, because the number of draws required for estimation grows exponentially with the number of parameters (Cherchi and Guevara, 2012).====Due to the computational burden, the estimated model can be restricted, avoiding the estimation of a full covariance matrix. These restrictions might be defensible in a specific case study, but the interpretation of the results needs to recognize the implications of the restrictions. For example, in a scaled multinomial logit model, the utility coefficients are allowed to vary only because of scale heterogeneity. Therefore, the scale parameter will capture any other existing source of variation in the utility coefficients. The generalized multinomial logit model was proposed to capture scale heterogeneity. However, given that it cannot be disentangled from other sources, the model estimates include the combined impact of all the sources of correlation of the parameter representing scale heterogeneity. The interpretation of the estimated coefficients must take this fact into account, and, as stated by Hess and Train (2017), that is not undertaken properly in many papers in the environmental valuation literature.====The research question of this paper is whether the estimated correlations in the RPL model, which include not only the correlation due to behavioural phenomena but also the correlation caused by scale heterogeneity, can be used for the interpretation of the results, allowing deeper insights into the analysed data. The empirical identification of the two concepts is not possible, but, under some assumptions, we can at least draw a conclusion regarding the sign of the correlation caused by the behaviour phenomena.====Therefore, this paper seeks to propose a procedure that allows for the interpretation of some of the estimated correlations. To achieve this goal, we propose a theoretical setting accounting for correlation due to a behavioural phenomenon and correlation induced by scale heterogeneity. Then, we define a very simple procedure to interpret the estimated correlations that consists of two steps. Firstly, the signs of the attributes corresponding to the negative mean coefficients are reversed so that the re-estimated RPL has all positive mean coefficients. Secondly, only negative correlations are interpreted. This interpretation obviously depends on the reversed signs of the attributes. If one of the pair of attributes of which the correlation is being analysed has a reversed sign, the estimated correlation must be interpreted with the opposite sign. If neither of the two attributes has a reversed sign, their estimated correlation is interpreted with the estimated sign. The proposed procedure is applied to three typical cases of environmental valuation carried out in the Basque Country.====Focusing on the environmental literature, the use of the RPL model in discrete choice model applications is overwhelming. Nevertheless, the application of the restrictive version of the RPL with uncorrelated utility coefficients clearly prevails. There are numerous examples of that approach in outdoor recreation (Murdock, 2006), environmental aspects of food production systems and environmental labelling (Bjørner et al., 2004; Carlsson et al., 2007; Lusk et al., 2007), landscape creation and conservation (Birol et al., 2006; Campbell, 2007; Scarpa et al., 2007) and hazard waste management (Layton, 2000).====In spite of the computational complexity and non-trivial interpretation, the body of work based on the use of the RPL model with correlated parameters has grown markedly in the last years. Revelt and Train (1998) study represents one of the first applications to estimate the impact of rebates and loans on US residential customers' choice of efficiency level for refrigerators. Table 1 presents examples of environmental valuation studies using the RPL model with correlated parameters. These studies apply this approach because of its flexibility, but they do not focus on the estimation and interpretation of scale heterogeneity and generally do not pay attention to the interpretation of the estimated correlations.====There are some applications of the RPL with correlated parameters that focus on the non-trivial interpretation of scale heterogeneity (Hess and Train, 2017). Examples of this approach focusing on forest management can be found in the studies by Czajkowski et al. (2014a, 2014b, 2015, 2016b). Some authors include the correlation of the parameters in other structures. Hybrid choice models based on RPL can include this feature easily, but the computational burden, which is already very high for this kind of model, increases even more. Examples of this approach can be found in the studies by Zawojska et al. (2019) and Faccioli et al. (2020), which focus on peatland restoration and renewable energy development, respectively.====Examples of the use of the RPL model with correlated parameters in transport economics include, for example, the studies by O'Neill and Hess (2014), who study the decision of workplace location of one member of a two-person household that affects the travel time and salary of both members, Hess et al. (2017), who analyse travellers' choices of route by car and public transport in Singapore, and Hou et al. (2018), who analyse crash frequency in freeway tunnels.====In other areas, the use of the RPL model with correlated parameters has also been increasing steadily. In education, Czajkowski et al. (2019a) study the preferences of young people for higher education, in labour economics, Eriksson and Kristensen (2014) estimate individuals’ willingness-to-pay values for fringe benefits and job amenities and, in cultural economics, Morey and Greer Rossmann (2003) focus on the preservation of marble monuments.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

The idea is simple, yet elegant. Impose a tax equal to marginal external damages in order to ‘internalize’ externalities and generate private decision making that is socially optimal (Pigou, 1920). But in an increasingly cashless society where the financial consequences of one's daily choices may only be experienced monthly or even quarterly, is it realistic to expect consumers to optimally perform this calculation? Indeed, an emerging literature that examines the impacts of price salience on purely private decisions suggests that this is unlikely to be the case across a range of contexts.==== In addition, many consumers use credit cards or other delayed payment mechanisms for everyday purchases, which means that they are in effect billed monthly. A large literature shows that using such payment modes increases spending (see, e.g., Hirschman, 1979; Feinberg, 1986; Prelec and Simester, 2001; and Thomas et al., 2011). These mechanisms can cause overconsumption of energy, water, food, and other resources with significant external social costs.====The so-called inattention problem raises the specter of additional policy interventions that increase salience in order to fix the ‘internality’ from privately suboptimal decision making.==== The implications for a simple static setting are straightforward – impose a super tax that forces consumers to face the full internal (i.e. salient-equivalent) and external costs. This logic becomes more complex in a dynamic setting with a more realistic representation of price salience as intermittent. The optimal (time-varying) tax will now depend on both the persistence of consumption across periods and the sophistication consumers have about their own price inattention. A large empirical literature shows that consumption decisions are highly persistent for a broad class of goods such as residential electricity consumption (Costa and Gerard, 2018; Deryugina et al., 2020; Filippini et al., 2018; Heien and Durham, 1991; Leth-Petersen, 2007; and Sexauer, 1977, to name a few), food (Thunstrom, 2010), gasoline (Scott, 2012), and cigarette consumption (Becker et al., 1994). This type of persistence can arise if a good is habit-forming (Becker and Murphy, 1988; Landry, 2019), when consumption is based on defaults or status quo bias (Samuelson and Zeckhauser, 1988) or when consumption depends on some complementary durable good stock (Flavin and Nakagawa, 2008). Moreover, recent research has shown that consumption persistence is an important consideration in the welfare effects of a corrective policy (Costa and Gerard, 2018).====Our work extends the key insights from this literature by showing that welfare effects are compounded by time-varying inattention and by demonstrating the importance of both persistence and inattention for the design of optimal and second-best policy. We develop a model of consumer behavior when prices are intermittently salient, demand persists across periods, and consumption creates external damages. We then derive optimal dynamic tax rules for two distinct types of consumers: a ==== agent who dynamically optimizes her consumption persistence under current perceived prices while unaware of future price inattention; and a ==== agent who anticipates her own future price inattention but does so imperfectly.==== Importantly for policy design, persistence provides a vehicle through which partially sophisticated agents can commit to reduce future consumption when prices are salient.==== Our work builds on the static models of corrective policy with externalities and internalities developed by Allcott et al. (2014) and Allcott and Taubinsky (2015) by evaluating a fully dynamic setting with time-varying inattention and consumption persistence. We represent persistence with a Becker and Murphy (1988) model of habit formation. This stylized framework produces consumption and taxation dynamics that are qualitatively in line with other common models of consumption persistence. Examples include durable goods investment by a representative household, nondurable consumption or durable goods utilization of an individual agent with status quo bias, or an agent that alternates between active and passive decision making because of external cues such as monthly bills.====We find that the optimal time-varying tax depends upon the price-elasticity of demand and the size of external damages, as well as the price salience decay function, consumption persistence, and time preference parameters. During relatively price-salient periods, greater consumption persistence and lower future price salience lead to lower taxes for the partially sophisticated agent and have no effect on taxes for the naive agent. This occurs because the partially sophisticated agent's implied demand for consumption is diminished by their commitment to lower habits in the future. Given that time-varying taxes are difficult to implement in practice, we evaluate the welfare consequences of some plausible constant tax alternatives.====Our theoretical work is followed by a numerical calibration for U.S. residential electricity consumption. The optimal tax rises as salience decays within a billing cycle, until the tax is more than three times larger than marginal external damage. The second-best constant tax, which leads to lower-than-optimal tax rates during non-salient periods and higher-than-optimal tax rates during salient periods, is more than twice the marginal external damage. The excess burden from the second-best tax ranges from about 19 dollars per household for naive agents to about 50 dollars per household for partially sophisticated agents. With approximately 126 million households in the U.S., this amounts to between 2.4 billion and 6.3 billion dollars in deadweight loss from the electricity sector, even if the second-best optimal tax is implemented. These welfare losses rise sharply if the tax is reduced from the second-best level, if inattention is more severe, or if demand is more elastic. For example, the welfare loss associated with having no tax at all ranges from 181 dollars per household for partially sophisticated agents to 198 dollars per household for naive agents, or 22.8 billion to 24.9 billion dollars.====The key insights from our model are not limited to electricity markets and should be relevant for any price-based policy designed to address market failures, where price/cost inattention and linked intertemporal decision making are commonplace. For example, gasoline consumption 1) emits several types of pollutants; 2) depends on vehicle type and driving habits that persist across many periods; and 3) does not present drivers with explicit, salient prices when making trip-level decisions. Similarly, unhealthy food choices 1) impose health costs on society; 2) are sometimes habit-forming, such that enjoyment in the current period depends on consumption in prior periods; and 3) are generally made at higher frequency than the purchases that make their costs salient. The increasing prevalence of auto-billing and subscription services for a range of purchases will only increase its applicability.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we set up the model and derive optimal and second-best taxes. In the subsequent section we derive formulas for the welfare loss from time-invariant taxes. This is followed by a section presenting the results from the numerical simulation.

We examine the fetal health impact of exposure to noise levels in excess of the EPA and the WHO recommended threshold of 55 dB. We find that the likelihood of having low birth weight (LBW) babies increases by 1.6 percentage points among mothers who live close to the airport, in the direction of the runway, exposed to noise levels over the 55 dB threshold, and during the period when NextGen was more actively implemented at the airport. Our finding has important policy implications for the trade-off between flight pattern optimization and human health in light of the long-term impact of LBW on later life outcomes.","Noise pollution, defined as “unwanted or excessive sound that can have deleterious effects on human health and environmental quality”==== has been a subject of regulation under the Noise Control Act of 1972 in the United States.==== However, despite being a significant public concern, noise pollution has not received adequate attention from policy-makers.==== A study by Hammer et al. (2014) estimates that, even in 2013, there were 104 million individuals at the risk of noise-induced hearing loss, and tens of millions ==== could suffer from noise-related health effects.====Adverse health effects of noise operate mainly through the activation of the central stress response system—the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis. Noise-induced activation of the HPA axis can lead to disrupted sleep, increased stress hormones, and elevated blood pressure and heart rate (Hoffmann, 2018). One important feature of this response of the HPA axis is that it does not require cognitive perception of the noise (Hoffmann, 2018), leading noise exposure to be referred to as a silent killer. Pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to noise because the increased HPA axis function during pregnancy can have negative effects on fetal health (Nieuwenhuijsen et al., 2017).====In 1997, the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Environmental Health (1997) issued a set of six recommendations. First among them was a call to pediatricians to “encourage research to determine health effects of noise exposure on pregnant women and their fetuses and infants” (p. 726). This call, more than two decades ago, resulted in only a sparse literature on noise and infant health in general and, to our knowledge, only one relatively recent study on exposure to aircraft noise and infant health. According to a 2017 World Health Organization (WHO) review of the 14 studies in the noise and infant health literature (Nieuwenhuijsen et al., 2017), only five were recent studies (post 2000) that examined the impact of traffic and total noise on infant health (Arroyo et al., 2016; Dadvand et al., 2014; Gehring et al., 2014; Hjortebjerg et al., 2016; Hystad et al., 2014), and only one (Matsui et al., 2003) specifically examined the impact of aircraft noise on infant health, despite the fact that aircraft noise, likely due to its loud intermittent nature, is more harmful than road traffic noise (Hoffmann, 2018). Our study aims to add to that literature and provides evidence of a potential causal effect of noise exposure on infant health.====In the economics field, there is an extensive literature focusing on the causal effect of early-life exposure to pollution, with the majority being focused on air pollution, for which Currie et al. (2014) provide a comprehensive summary.==== However, that literature so far has not examined the causal effect of noise pollution, and our study aims to fill that gap. Similar to the air pollution studies in the economics field (summarized in Currie et al., 2014), which focus on a causal effect of air pollution but with a limitation of not being able to decompose that effect along each causal pathway (e.g., oxidative stress vs. inflammation), our study also focuses on a causal effect of noise pollution but being unable to quantify each causal pathway (e.g., disrupted sleep vs. elevated stress).====In this study we focus on infant health at birth, and specifically low birth weight (LBW), defined as birth weight under 2500 g. Although in epidemiological studies an association between high-level noise exposure and LBW (but not other reproductive outcomes) has been found (Ristovska et al., 2014), causal estimates of the effect of noise exposure on LBW are still lacking. Such estimates are essential not only for informing policy-making, but also for understanding the long-term impact of those policies, given the robust association found in the literature between birth weight and adulthood outcomes related to health, education and earnings (Currie and Rossin-Slater, 2015).====Identification of a causal effect of noise exposure on health requires exogenous variation in noise exposure. While random assignment of noise exposure could produce that exogenous variation, in reality such random assignment of people is rarely possible. However, a nationwide initiative undertaken by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)—the Next Generation Air Transportation System (known as NextGen)—aimed at improving air travel ==== produced significant, and arguably exogenous, variation in noise exposure, which we exploit to estimate a causal effect of noise exposure on health. One important feature of NextGen is the use of precision satellite monitoring (replacing radar-based surveillance), which produces satellite-designed optimum routes that reduce flight time and save fuel. In reality, however, usage of these optimum routes by more and more aircraft, combined with landing at ==== altitudes (resulting from precision satellite monitoring), has exposed residents living in an area under the new routes to “a constant barrage of airplanes flying over their homes” (CBS News, 2015). These residents were caught off-guard, because the implementation of NextGen by the FAA was exempted by the U.S. Congress from normal environmental impact reviews and public hearings (CBS News, 2015).====Using unique birth data that contain information on mothers' exact home addresses, we are able to identify those living close to the airport and also in the direction of the runway, where there is a NextGen-induced, sharp increase in noise exposure. Given that our birth data are from New Jersey, our study focuses on births to mothers living near Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), one of the busiest airports in the country. We examine the impact of exposure to noise levels in excess of 55 dB,==== the threshold used for the protection of public health by the EPA (EPA, 1974) and the WHO (Berglund et al., 1999), on birth outcomes. Using birth data from 2004 to 2016, we find an increase of 1.6 percentage points in the likelihood of having LBW babies among mothers who live close to the airport, in the direction of the runway, exposed to noise levels over the 55 dB threshold, and during the period when NextGen was more actively implemented at the airport. We also find that the effect of residential noise exposure on LBW appears to be more salient among male babies than among female babies, which is consistent with the “fragile male” hypothesis (Eriksson et al., 2010).====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature. Section 3 describes the data. Section 4 describes our identification strategy, followed by Section 5 where we present the regression models.

Measurements are typically imperfect and costly to obtain. The decision of whether to invest in resource measurement may be influenced by other state variables, for example a resource commodity price. We introduce a mixed-observability model of optimal forest management featuring a partially-observable forest resource and perfectly-observable stochastic price. The decision maker optimizes the expected net present value of forest returns by choosing when to measure current forest volume (conduct an inventory), harvest and replant, or delay action. Parameter values are obtained from numerous forestry data sources. Optimal investment in inventory reduces the cost of uncertainty about timber volume and increases the predictability of returns. Moreover, price stochasticity interacts with inventory decisions to produce asymmetric effects of high and low prices on inventory timing. We also produce the first graphical Faustmann rule analogues for jointly-optimal inventory and harvest.","Many studies addressing resource management under uncertainty and learning focus on parameter uncertainty (e.g. Springborn and Sanchirico, 2013). This orientation of the literature has left the problem of making choices when key state variables are either unobserved or partially observed relatively overlooked. Along with parameter uncertainty, resource managers also face state uncertainty, which differs from parameter uncertainty both conceptually and in terms of how it is operationalized in optimal resource management models. While parameters of resource systems can often be approximated as static (if unknown) quantities, most state variables are inherently stochastic and dynamic. Crucially, because the dynamics of these state variables are stochastic, in the absence of new information (obtained either through direct measurement or indirect signals) a resource manager's uncertainty about the current value of a state variable will typically grow from one decision period to the next (MacLachlan et al., 2017).====In practice, investment in information about the state of a system plays a central role in natural resource management, and previous studies demonstrate how the lack of such information can adversely affect management (e.g., Holopainen et al., 2010a). Despite the fact that natural resource managers routinely invest in information on the abundance of resources (e.g., fishery stock assessments, threatened species abundance), nearly all models of natural resource management ignore state uncertainty. Recent advances in optimization techniques have enabled a number of studies to overcome the high computational expense of modeling state uncertainty in resource management (Fackler and Haight, 2014; MacLachlan et al., 2017; Kling et al., 2017; Memarzadeh et al., 2019); however, these studies are limited to cases where all of the dynamic state variables are uncertain. There are many problems in natural resource economics that involve mixed observability, where some state variables are partially observable and others are perfectly observable (Fackler and Pacifici, 2014). Stocks of fish, trees, and minerals are generally not freely or perfectly observable to the resource manager, although costly investment in information can improve estimates of stock sizes. On the other hand, current input and output prices can readily be observed by the manager, even if future prices are stochastic. Dynamic optimization models that accommodate mixed observability have the potential to yield important new insights into natural resource management because they can uncover whether and how observable state variables influence optimal management and learning about resource stocks subject to state uncertainty. Mixed-observability models are also the theoretically appropriate framework for characterizing the value of information about uncertain state variables in systems where perfectly-observable states and uncertain states are likely to have an economically-significant link in decision making.====The aim of this paper is to address the problem of optimal measurement and harvest of a renewable resource under conditions of mixed observability. We examine the specific case of timber stand management, where the current per-unit price of timber is observable to the forest manager, while a costly investment in an inventory==== is required to obtain an estimate of current timber volume (Scott and Gove, 2002; Pukkala and Kellomäki, 2012). Despite timber inventories being a common activity for forest managers (Scott and Gove, 2002), the economic rationale for these investments remains largely unexplored. To construct our model, we employ a framework known as a continuous-state Mixed Observability Markov Decision Process (MOMDP). Examples of MOMDPs addressing natural resource management have so far been limited to highly stylized applications where the resource state variables are discretized into a small number of categories (e.g. Chadès et al., 2012; Fackler and Haight, 2014). A continuous-state MOMDP approach allows for a more realistic description of resource dynamics, especially those of timber volume. An obstacle to applying MOMDPs in economics is the high computational cost of solving them. In order to preserve the continuous-state dynamics of timber volume, we extend an approximate solution technique from Zhou et al. (2010) that has been previously applied to simpler problems where all state variables are measured with error (MacLachlan et al., 2017; Kling et al., 2017). To the best of our knowledge, our model is the first continuous-state MOMDP in the natural resource economics literature.====We parameterize our model using volume, price, and cost data for timber stands in the southern United States and evaluate scenarios with and without inventories and under alternative informational assumptions. The empirical grounding of our optimization model is uncommon in the literature on state uncertainty.==== We find that the option to conduct inventories raises the expected net present value of the timber stand such that mean returns nearly reach their value in the counterfactual where timber volumes are perfectly observable. A key insight from our results is that stochastic price dynamics have an important influence on inventory decisions. Inventories are most likely to be chosen (specifically, the range of expected timber volumes at which inventories take place is greatest) at prices near the mean of the stationary price process. This is partly because the cost of delaying harvest in order to conduct an inventory is low because only small changes in price are expected. In contrast, when prices are high, the cost of delaying harvest is also high because prices are expected to fall, and so inventories are less common. Finally, at low prices, the manager is better off waiting to see if prices rise before committing to either a harvest or an inventory. This asymmetry in inventory decisions is magnified by the degree of uncertainty over the timber volume estimate. When there is a high degree of confidence in the estimate, inventories are only conducted at prices near the mean. However, as confidence decreases, it becomes optimal to conduct inventories at ever higher prices. With low confidence, an inventory may indicate a large timber volume that can be harvested before prices fall further. To our knowledge, this is the first characterization of the relationship between stochastic price dynamics and inventory in the literature.====Our analysis yields results of particular significance for forest economics. To our knowledge, we introduce the first economic theory of forest inventory. While the science and practice of forest measurement is central to contemporary forestry, investment in information has so far not figured into predictive models or normative economic prescriptions for fundamental activities like harvest planning. Using the solution to our model, we simulate the stochastic dynamics of timber stand management. This allows us to study the timing of inventory investment alongside harvest choices. Notably, we find that inventories do not typically occur in young stands, even at very low levels of certainty. The reason is that resolving uncertainty is more valuable later in the stand's development, when it is more likely to be harvested. While our model is more complex than the classical Faustmann bioeconomic model, we are able to construct intuitive graphical analogues to standard visual depictions of the Faustmann model-based harvest timing. For the first time, we are able to generate bioeconomically-based “harvest and inventory schedules” that numerically characterize Faustmann-like rules for planning harvest ==== inventory jointly.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Sections 2 reviews the relevant literature on models of state uncertainty and inventories for forest management.

Using 46,012 facility-year observations for 7947 polluting facilities across all ==== in the U.S., we find strong evidence of intra-firm pollution substitution associated with the HPVP. On average, a compliant facility increased its toxic air emissions by about 35–56 percent (3600 to 6000 lbs.) if it had at least one other sister facility, within the same 6-digit NAICS industry code and belonging to the same parent firm, concurrently under violation. The magnitude of such intra-firm pollution substitution was stronger towards compliant facilities with no prior history of high priority violation as well as towards those owned by private parent companies. We also find that substitution of pollution from a sister facility under violation increases the risk of violation among currently compliant facilities.","The economic benefits of environmental regulation are well documented (Chay and Greenstone, 2003; Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). However, many environmental regulations are associated with pollution leakages or spillovers (Henderson, 1996; Dean et al., 2009; Hanna, 2010) where the regulation not only leads to a decrease in emissions at the targeted location as intended, but also triggers an unintended change in emissions elsewhere. Such pollution spillovers make it difficult to estimate the overall impact on pollution due to regulation. For example, if a pollution reduction policy in one location, unintendedly, increases pollution elsewhere, then the environmental benefits of the regulation are positive in the location where it was implemented and negative where there were unintended spillovers. As a whole, the net improvement in pollution associated with such a policy depends on the magnitude of the intended decrease in pollution at the targeted location as well as the magnitude of the unintended pollution leakage. As spillovers can either be negative or positive, the estimated environmental benefits due to pollution control regulation may be biased upward or downward respectively, and the overall welfare impact is ambiguous. A reliable analysis of any pollution regulation, thus, warrants a closer examination of potential pollution spillovers. In this paper, we estimate the magnitude of pollution spillovers associated with one policy in particular – the High Priority Violations Policy (HPVP) under the Clean Air Act (CAA).====Implemented in 1999, the HPVP mandates inspection agencies to label certain violations of the CAA as “high priority” so as to ensure that these violations are addressed and resolved in a timely and appropriate manner. A violation is labeled “high-priority” if it poses a significant public health risk or it severely impedes the implementation of other CAA programs (EPA, 1999).==== We focus on violations that fit either the eighth general HPV criterion or any of the five HPV matrix criteria (violation criteria which concern over emission of regulated chemicals or chemical class) because the HPVP can have some unintended consequences for these particular types of violations.====For example, if a polluting facility is in a high priority violation that fits the abovementioned criteria, then it is required to decrease emissions as per the policy mandate; however, such a requirement also creates incentives for the parent firm to substitute emissions away from the violating facility towards other facilities that are not in violation of the CAA requirements.==== In this case, there is a negative spillover (spillover that has negative environmental consequences) associated with the HPVP which, if not accounted for, upwardly biases the estimate of the overall decrease in pollution concentration due to the policy.==== Conversely, a cap on emissions at a violating facility could also trigger positive spillovers (spillovers that lead to positive gains in environmental quality): the parent firm might simultaneously decrease emissions in other facilities that are not in violation so as to avoid having multiple facilities under violation, and hence, multiple fines and penalties. These types of positive spillovers might be triggered by the desire to maintain a positive public image of the company (Dyck et al====, 2008; Kitzmueller and Shimshack, 2012). Since information on HPVs is publicly available in the EPA’s National Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) website, this is indeed a plausible hypothesis. Alternatively, positive spillovers could also be triggered by learning by doing in abatement. Therefore, the magnitude and net sign of the spillovers associated with mandatory pollution reduction policies under the HPVP is an empirical question with important policy implications.====To estimate the sign and magnitude of the pollution spillovers associated with the HPVP, we use data from EPA’s Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) and its retired Air Facilities System (AFS). The AFS contains emissions, compliance, and enforcement data on Clean Air Act stationary sources of air pollution. Using one-to-one nearest neighbor matching for identification, we measure whether a compliant facility belonging to a multi-facility firm increases or decreases its total TRI air emissions while it has at least one other sister facility (i.e. facility belonging to the same parent firm) within the same 6-digit NAICS code under a high priority violation. Our treatment group comprises compliant facilities belonging to multi-facility companies that have at least one sister facility concurrently under high priority violation, while the control group consists of compliant facilities belonging to multi-facility firms that do not have any sister facilities concurrently under violation. To establish causality between the assignment of high priority violation at a facility and the change in emissions at other compliant sister facilities within the firm, we match our treated observations with the nearest control based on various facility- and firm-level variables including the observed growth rate of the facility’s and its parent firm’s total production of TRI chemicals, a proxy for facility age, one-year lag of facility CAA inspections, and one-year lag of facility total TRI air emissions.==== We also ensure that the nearest neighbor in our matched sample has an exact match on the reporting year, the 6-digit NAICS industry code, the facility’s location (state), the facility’s participation in the EPA’s Pollution Prevention (P2), and the total number of compliant sister facilities.====We find strong and statistically significant evidence of negative pollution spillovers or intra-firm pollution substitution associated with the HPVP. On average, a compliant facility increased its total TRI air emissions by roughly 35 to 56 percent if it had at least one other sister facility in the same 6-digit industry code concurrently under violation. Furthermore, we find that the direction of pollution spillover is negative among compliant facilities with no history of high priority violation, whereas it is positive among those facilities with some history of high priority violations. In other words, the impact of the treatment on facilities with no history of high priority violations is a net ==== in TRI air emissions, while the impact of the treatment on facilities with some history of high priority violations is a net ==== in TRI air emissions. The magnitude of the within-firm pollution substitution is also larger for facilities owned by private companies as compared to facilities owned by publicly traded companies. Lastly, our results also suggest that the treated facilities (which, on average, increase their air emissions due to intra-firm pollution substitution) have a higher probability (up to 6 percentage points more) of entering high priority violation themselves in the future compared to the control group of facilities. Interestingly, we find that older compliant facilities are less likely to enter violation in the future, while facilities that have been subjected to multiple regulatory actions (e.g., notice of infractions, penalty, and other judicial actions) are more likely to enter a violation in the future if they currently have a non-compliant sister facility.====Our research contributes to the literature on pollution leakage (Levinson and Scott Taylor, 2008; Fowlie, 2009; Davis and Kahn, 2010; Gibson, 2019). Most of the papers in this literature focus on international pollution leakage; our work is unique in its focus on the within-firm substitution of toxic air pollutants from one geographical location to another in the U.S. Our work is also notable for the careful cross-examination of facility-firm linkages provided in the TRI data using Mergent Intellect, which features a deep collection of firm-level information gathered by Dun and Bradstreet. The empirical question we attempt to answer has important policy implications. If multi-facility firms substitute emissions among facilities within the company, then pollution reduction policies directed at protecting public health must not only consider the intended emission reductions at the targeted facility but also regulation-induced unintended change in emissions across all other facilities owned by the firm.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the relevant literature on pollution leakage and other spillovers associated with environmental regulations; Section 3 contains background information on the CAA and the HPVP; in Section 4 we discuss potential mechanisms for HPV-induced pollution leakage; Section 5 provides a description of the data; Section 6 outlines the identification strategy; Section 7 contains a discussion of the results, and Section 8 concludes.",High priority violations and intra-firm pollution substitution,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069620300826,7 July 2020,2020,Research Article,225.0

We examine whether willingness to pay (WTP) to reduce mortality and morbidity risk depends on the type of illness caused by the pollution. Three major illnesses attributable to air pollution are examined in a choice experiment in Beijing, China. We find robust evidence, testing for both observed and unobserved preference heterogeneity, that WTP does not vary by illness type, and hence, that WTP for policy purposes should not be differentiated based on illness type. We also find that income, education, gender and other factors related with risk vulnerability well predict self-protection, and that respondents who engage more in self-protection have stronger preferences for public interventions. Our results suggest a value of a statistical life (VSL) and value of a statistical illness (VSI) of RMB 5.54 million (USD 1.58 million) and RMB 0.82 million (USD 0.23 million), which are higher than earlier estimates in China. This imply that for societies with strong economic growth and significant pollution, VSL and VSI are likely to increase rapidly, further strengthening the role of policies on pollution control and public health.","Ambient air pollution is a major environmental hazard to human health (Dockery et al., 1993; Pope III et al., 2002; Lim et al., 2012; Landrigan et al., 2018). The Global Burden of Disease Study (2017) estimates that 7.2 million premature deaths in 2017 were due to environmental factors, of which 3.4 million were due to ambient fine particulate matter (PM====) and ozone pollution. Most of these environmentally caused illnesses and fatalities occur in highly populous emerging economies, where over the past few years managing air quality has become an increasingly significant regulatory concern (China State Council, 2013; India MEFCC, 2019). One example of a country undergoing this profound change is China, a very large economy with global impact. Since the passage of the ==== (Action Plan) in 2013 and the greatly amended ==== (New Law) in 2015, both China's central and local governments have implemented numerous large-scale, and often costly, policies designed to control air pollution.==== The ==== and the ==== are not the first measures taken to deal with air pollution in China, but they are the first to explicitly aim to reduce PM==== concentration through a combination of political incentives and more rigorous enforcement (Jin et al., 2016).====Such regulatory efforts come at a cost, however. One tool favored by economists for evaluating policies is benefit-cost analysis (BCA). As a decision tool, BCA provides decision makers with guidance for efficient resource allocation. The strong efficiency criterion for regulatory efforts to reduce air pollution is to maximize the net benefits (benefits minus costs). A weaker efficiency criterion requires that benefits “justify” costs, which has been embedded in legislation in many developed countries for decades (US OMB, 2003; Wiener, 2006; Morgenstern, 2014). In China, however, BCA, or more broadly, regulatory impact analysis (RIA), has seldom been used to evaluate environmental policies (Jin et al., 2016, 2017). Such an approach is urgently needed, as there is a high risk of resource misallocation when air pollution control policies are designed and implemented without timely evaluation of their efficiency. Lack of policy evaluation is not only a concern for China: due to its size, China's policies can have a large global impact, e.g. by affecting the prospects of climate change mitigation.====One challenge when implementing evaluation tools like BCA is that no easily available prices exist for health outcomes. Benefit-cost analysis needs a common metric for all benefits and costs, and usually money acts as this common metric. As no easily available prices exist, health outcomes need to be monetized by analysts. Monetary estimates for health benefits should be based on the individual preferences of the affected population, and the appropriate measure of such preferences is individual willingness to pay (WTP) for health risk reductions (see, e.g., Andersson et al., 2019a). Empirically, WTP is elicited either through revealed-preference (RP) or stated-preference (SP) studies, in which actual individual choices in markets or their answers to hypothetical scenarios in surveys are used (see, e.g., Freeman et al., 2014; Champ et al., 2017). Concerning WTP for health risk reductions, much of the focus has been on eliciting values to reduce mortality risk. The monetary value is conventionally reported for the prevention of one premature statistical death in the population, which is usually referred to as value of a statistical life (VSL) (Andersson et al., 2019a).==== However, many health outcomes, including those related to air pollution, are non-fatal. Such non-fatal outcomes can also be monetized using the same RP and SP methods (see, e.g., Barwick et al., 2018; Hammitt and Haninger, 2017), and their monetary equivalents to the VSL are often referred to as value of a statistical illness (VSI) (see, e.g., Andersson et al., 2015).====The aim of this article is to elicit individual preferences regarding health risk reductions resulting from air quality improvement in a fast-developing metropolitan context. The study is conducted in China, and one of its three main objectives is to elicit VSL and VSI that can inform policy development in a Chinese context. There is already a rich literature on monetizing health preferences (see, e.g., Viscusi, 2014; Lindhjem et al., 2011), but the majority of the studies have been conducted in developed countries, and it is well established that there is no one-size-fits-all “best estimate” of, e.g., VSL (Cameron, 2010). The environmental problems in developed countries are often less severe than in developing ones, and therefore the associated health risks are lower. Other factors such as income, age, gender, and education level may also influence individual preferences concerning health, and have been examined in various studies (see, e.g., Carlsson et al., 2010; Alberini and Ščasnỳ, 2011; Cameron and DeShazo, 2013). Given that 92% of all pollution-related mortalities occur in low- and middle-income countries (Landrigan et al., 2018), and that various factors influence VSL, using value transfers based on preference estimates from developed to developing countries (Masterman and Viscusi, 2018) involve substantial uncertainty (Robinson et al., 2019b). Moreover, unlike mortality, WTP for morbidity risks reductions is poorly understood in developing and developed countries (US EPA, 2010; Cameron, 2014; Hunt et al., 2016). Further, it can be argued that existing empirical findings on WTP to reduce health risk related to air pollution in China are insufficient to support the current regulatory context. Huang et al. (2018), in addition to providing new estimates, provided a review of Chinese VSL studies, which revealed that many studies were relatively old. However, due to China's rapid development, pollution and income levels have changed; in addition, through different information channels people have become more aware of air pollution and its effects on health (Yang, 2016; Ravetti et al., 2019). For these reasons, preferences regarding better air quality and health risk reductions may have changed in China, and hence people's WTP (Hammitt et al., 2019).====The second main objective of this study is to examine whether the type of illness matters for individual preferences, i.e. whether their WTP to reduce the mortality or morbidity risk differs depending on illness type. This is of high research and policy relevance, because if preferences differ it would suggest that VSL and VSI should be differentiated based on illness type. To conduct the empirical analysis and elicit WTP we employ choice experiments (CE). This is an SP method; we choose to use this approach rather than RP because it allows us to control the decision alternatives. In addition, RP studies on morbidity are difficult to conduct, because real market data rarely reflect the trade-offs between often non-fatal, chronic environmental morbidity and wealth. An alternative SP approach is the contingent valuation (CV) method, which values the aggregate outcome of an environmental change; it is therefore less suited to isolating separate values for the mortality and morbidity components (Adamowicz et al., 2011). To test if preferences differ across illnesses, it should be noted that our study is from an environmental health-risk “prevention” perspective. Related but differently, there are also CE studies in health economics eliciting preferences across illness profiles (e.g., symptoms, treatments and lifetime impacts). Medical and health-care contexts motivate them to use such within-illness characteristics as attributes; see, e.g., the discussion of this literature in Cameron (2014). We instead used illness type as part of scenarios. This is because under environmental pollution context, better environment mainly leads to aggregated reduction of illness specific risks, rather than changes of within-illness characteristics. Hence, given our objectives, we designed a CE to examine individual preferences for mortality and morbidity risk reductions of different illnesses from publicly funded measures to improve air quality in a rapid developing, severely polluted, strong regulatory context, i.e. Beijing, China.====Our third objective is to examine the relationship between self-protection and preferences for publicly provided policies.==== In 2013 the real time air quality index became available, and since then air pollution and its potential negative health effects have been widely known to Chinese citizens (Jin et al., 2016). This has lead to a widespread adoption of self-protection measures, such as wearing particulate-filtering masks (Zhang and Mu, 2018) and using household air-purifiers (Ito and Zhang, 2020). Different individuals, including our respondents, adopt these measures with different type of products, and at different prices and usage frequencies (Sun et al., 2017). These directly observed behavioral indicators jointly point to a wide distribution of a latent self-protection “construct” (or attitude/trait) across respondents. In this study, we estimate such latent self-protection and use it to explain individual choices of public programs. Our contextual analysis informs resource allocation among societal groups with different self-protection levels against air pollution.====This article is structured as follows. In the next section we first describe health risks related to air pollution that are of interest to this study, then the theory behind monetizing health risk reductions, and finally the effect of self-protection on the WTP. In section 3, we describe the survey used to collect the data and how it was implemented. In sections 4 Empirical methods, 5 Results, we describe the empirical methods used and the results of the analysis. The article ends with section 6, which discusses the findings and their implications.","Do preferences to reduce health risks related to air pollution depend on illness type?

In these areas, timber firms claim to avoid destroying the forest but, absent monitoring, may fail to follow through. As an alternative, a consumer could pay a little more and buy wood - or diamonds, or tuna – displayed with an eco-label, which indicates an auditor found it to satisfy a minimum standard. Eco-labels address monitoring failures and may lead to better environmental protection (Hamilton and Zilberman, 2006). They also increase industry profits.====About a quarter of over 400 eco-labels are managed by industry.==== Entry into eco-label markets is unregulated – there is no global minimum standard – and entry by industry has increased more rapidly than by other groups (Gruere, 2015). The effect of competition between industry and environmentalist eco-labels on environmental protection is theoretically ambiguous (Fischer and Lyon, 2014; Fischer and Lyon, 2019; Li and van't Veld, 2015). Industry standards tend to be weaker, drawing firms away from the stricter environmentalist standard. Yet, a weaker standard extends some environmental protection to higher-cost firms. Theoretically, label competition may help or hurt environmental protection.====In practice, which is it - does competition help or hurt? Calls to harmonize standards make this question urgent, yet we lack empirical evidence. In this paper, I use the theoretical framework developed by Fischer and Lyon (2014) and variation in forest compliance costs to address this question in the context of forestry in the Congo Basin. The Congo Basin forest is second in size to the Amazon and it is globally important in regulating climate and housing biodiversity. Locally, it provides food, shelter, fiber, and other products to sixty million forest users and indirectly supports forty million people in nearby urban areas (Nasi et al., 2011).====A forest's compliance costs depend on the eco-label's monitoring criteria. For tropical forestry, compliance costs include: opportunity costs from leaving trees behind; infrastructure costs from detailed road-planning to avoid hillsides and streams; administrative costs from tracking wood from stump to port; conservation costs from setting aside critical habitat; and development costs from offering services to local communities. Global and regional spatial data proxy for compliance costs. I estimate an ordered probit and a semi-nonparametric estimator to find the cutoff forest types for each label, trace out the compliance cost distribution, and tests predictions from the theoretical model by showing that lower cost forests are more likely to participate in stricter labels. Using the cutoffs and the distribution of compliance costs, I infer the shape of consumers' willingness to pay for environmental protection and assess whether competition helps or hurts environmental benefits.====Whether competition helps or hurts depends on how compliance costs vary across firms. Firms with lower costs participate in stricter labels. Stricter labels earn higher prices but have fewer participants. Absent competition, the environmentalist faces a trade off: a strict standard with few participants, each protecting more, or a weak standard with more participants, each protecting less. Competition with industry may lead to a race to the bottom or it may allow each label to focus on a different margin - the environmentalist strict protection and industry broad participation - so that, together, they increase protection more than the environmentalist alone. However, even if labels differentiate with competition, benefits may decrease. The change in benefits depends on how environmental benefits lost from firms switching to the industry label compares to increases in benefits more firms participating and a stricter NGO standard.====I find that eco-label competition likely decreases protection for Congo Basin forests. For Congo Basin timber, observable proxies and two label thresholds offer evidence that forests select into labels based on compliance cost. The analysis is sensitive to assumptions about the unobserved distribution of forest types, thus using a semi-nonparametric estimator is key. Though the labels differentiate with competition, I find the distribution of forest types is skewed toward high cost forests. This distributional shape limits the increase in participation in the industry label and exaggerates the loss of protection from inframarginal forests that would have chosen the NGO label in autarky but switch instead to the industry label with competition. Based on the shape of the distribution and price premium, NGO certified timber is expected to earn 9–17% more than industry certified timber and industry certified timber is expected to earn 14–28% more than uncertified timber.====This paper makes four contributions to the literature. First, though eco-labels have been richly treated in the theoretical literature, we have few empirical tests of our theoretical models’ predictions (Bonroy and Constantatos, 2015). This paper addresses this gap by testing predictions from the Fischer and Lyon (2014) model. I find strong evidence that forests with low compliance costs choose to participate in stricter standards.==== We might expect this type of selection to occur in voluntary policies more generally. Selection on costs complicates empirical evaluation of policy effectiveness and limits the scope of eco-labels as a policy tool for increasing environmental benefits.====The second contribution is to rigorously assess, for the first time, whether eco-label competition helps or hurts environmental benefits. Though we have some evidence that weaker labels change harvesting practices (Cerutti et al., 2011; Heilmayr and Lambin, 2016), these studies cannot answer whether benefits with an industry label increase relative to an NGO label in autarky. The empirical methodology developed in this paper can be replicated in different contexts. Does label competition always decrease benefits in forestry settings? What about areas with weak governance? More work is needed to document empirical patterns of eco-label compettion and environmental benefits and help policymakers better understand when to restrict label entry by industry.====The third contribution of this paper is to estimate the shape of consumers’ willingness to pay for environmental benefits from responsible forestry. I find that the price premium is bowed: initial increases in protection have a high marginal willingness-to-pay but each additional unit of protection is less valuable. Though estimates of the price premium for NGO certified timber relative to uncertified timber exist (Kollert and Lagan, 2007; Nebel et al., 2005), we lack estimates of the price premium for industry certified timber and how it relates to NGO certified timber. The price for NGO certified timber is likely about 9–17% higher than industry certified timber.====The final contribution of this paper is to showcase a flexible semi-nonparametric estimator developed by Gallant and Douglas (1987) and made accessible by Stewart (2004) to estimate willingness-to-pay (WTP) for environmental protection. Relaxing distributional assumptions when estimating willingness to pay has long been an interest for environmental economists (Cooper, 2002; Crooker and Herriges, 2004; Chen and Randall, 1997; Stewart, 2004) and continues to be of interest today (Bergtold and Ramsey, 2015). The semi-nonparametric estimator used here can be used for the travel cost method (Huang et al., 2008) and other settings with ordinal data.",How does eco-label competition affect environmental benefits?

Our paper demonstrates the context-dependency of this result. In most industrialized countries, average electricity consumption and carbon intensity are well below US levels. Consequently, HER interventions can only become cost-effective if ==== sizes are substantially higher. For Germany, we provide evidence from a large-scale randomized controlled trial that effect sizes are in fact considerably lower than in the US. We conclude by illustrating that targeting highly responsive subgroups is crucial to reach cost-effectiveness and by identifying the few countries in which HER are promising policy instruments.","A large literature has shown that social norms can affect individual choices in a variety of domains such as water use (Brent et al., 2015; Ferraro et al., 2011; Ferraro and Price, 2013; Jaime and Carlsson, 2018) and charitable giving (Frey and Meier, 2004; Shang and Croson, 2009). A prominent example are the social comparison-based home energy reports (HER) that the company ==== mailed to millions of US households in order to reduce their electricity consumption. Evaluations of ==== HER have documented considerable reductions in electricity consumption of 1.4–3.3% that are also persistent over time (Allcott, 2011; Allcott and Rogers, 2014).==== Given their low intervention costs, HER are said to be a cost-effective policy instrument to combat climate change (Allcott, 2011) and often serve as a prime example for behavioral interventions that can be scaled to “millions of consumers” (Allcott and Mullainathan, 2010).====In this paper, we assess the cost-effectiveness of HER interventions in industrialized countries other than the US. While our paper does not question the internal validity of the Allcott (2011) and Allcott and Rogers (2014) findings, we complement their work by testing the external validity and transferability to other contexts. As Allcott (2015, p. 1162) concludes, “replication is crucial for program evaluation because it gives a sense of the distribution of effects in different contexts”. Hence, we thereby also contribute to the growing literature on the context-dependency of causal effects measured in a particular policy population and on the scalability of experimental findings (e.g. Al-Ubaydli et al., 2017a, b; Christensen and Miguel, 2018; Dehejia et al., 2019; DellaVigna and Linos, 2020; Gechter, 2015; Peters et al., 2018; Vivalt, 2015).====In Section 2, we demonstrate that US electricity consumption and carbon intensity levels exceed those in virtually all other OECD countries, and that HER are cost-effective in the US precisely because of these relatively high levels. Consequently, the effect sizes of HER treatments would have to be substantially larger in other countries in order to make it a cost-effective climate policy intervention. We show that, at effect sizes observed in the ==== studies, HER can only be cost-effective in the US and Australia. To be cost-effective in the rest of the world, HER must generate much larger effect sizes.====In a next step, we test for the effectiveness of HER in Germany, a country with electricity consumption levels that, compared to the US, match the OECD average more closely (Section 3). Based on data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) among 11,630 households, we find that HER reduce electricity consumption by 0.7%, less than half of the average reductions observed in the ==== studies. One reason for the smaller effects in our sample is probably that the social comparisons cannot be updated in Germany on a quarterly basis because customers are metered annually. This is what the different effect sizes for different updating frequencies indicate that Allcott and Rogers (2014) observe in the US. Yet, consistent with prior studies in the water and energy contexts (Allcott, 2011; Ferraro and Price, 2013; Ferraro and Miranda, 2013), we probe into the heterogeneity of effects and our findings suggest that the smaller effects are mostly due to the generally lower consumption levels in Germany. Hence, for the majority of industrialized countries exhibiting similarly low consumption levels, effect sizes can be expected to be much lower than in the US. HER are not cost-effective in such contexts.====In Section 4, we build on our heterogeneity analysis across baseline consumption levels to explore the potential of targeting particularly responsive subgroups, such as high-consumption households. To this end, we calculate the effect sizes required to make HER cost-effective and compare them to effect sizes observed in high-consumption strata. We find that for many countries, such as the United Kingdom, South Korea, Canada, Germany, and Poland, targeting HER can be a promising policy instrument, but only if targeted consumer groups exhibit effect sizes between 5% and 7%. In Germany, we estimate an effect of 3.1% in the highest decile, suggesting that even the top decile is not as responsive as required.====In Section 5, we explore the sensitivity of our results to treatment effect persistence and a broader welfare perspective. HER might not only decrease consumption in the year of the treatment but also beyond. Effect persistence considerably amplifies the benefits of HER, which is likely to make them cost-effective in the US, Australia, and Japan, but not in European countries. A further robustness check examines the broader welfare effects following Allcott and Kessler (2019). This approach suggests taking into account market imperfections beyond externalities from carbon emissions. No clear picture emerges from this extended welfare analysis. We show that assumptions to gauge electricity market distortions critically determine whether the welfare perspective improves or worsens the assessment of HER. In the concluding section, we identify countries in which targeted HER are particularly promising and discuss the implication of ongoing digitalization in the customer interface of utilities for our findings.",Social Norms and Energy Conservation Beyond the US,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069620300747,24 June 2020,2020,Research Article,228.0

We study the impact of these changes on internal migration and population distribution. We employ a spatial equilibrium model in which the climate shapes workers' locational choices through the usual amenity-value channel and the novel indirect channel via agriculture wages. Our simulations reveal that migration rates are 9.65% higher, and that 0.9 million more people migrate inter-regionally under future climate conditions. Furthermore, climate change will likely exacerbate the country's regional ====, as the most developed regions gain population and welfare while the least developed regions lose.","The influence of climate on people's lives is undeniable. Because we expect sizable spatially heterogenous changes in climate, it is reasonable to conjecture that these changes will spur migration and reshape the spatial distribution of people and economic activity. Our goal in this paper is to quantify these phenomena.====Specifically, we turn to the case of Brazil to conduct our study. The country's continental dimensions and climate diversity imply that its regions will experience different temperature rises, a point illustrated in Fig. 1.==== Also, the Brazilian population censuses provide detailed data on migration flows at a fine geographic level. Brazil, therefore, offers an ideal setting to study the impact of climate change on internal migration patterns.==== Moreover, because a large share of the country's labor force is employed in agriculture, we examine the impact of climate change on migration through its effect on agricultural income.====For our quantitative exercise we propose a spatial equilibrium framework in which we use discrete-choice techniques to model workers' locational choices (Timmins, 2007; Morten and Oliveira, 2018). The utility from living in a given location is a function of local attributes—wages, rental prices, climate, and non-climate amenities—and an idiosyncratic taste parameter.==== Importantly, our model departs from Timmins (2007) and distinguishes two channels through which climate may impact locational choice: the usual amenity-value channel and the novel indirect channel via agriculture wages.====The distinction is possible because our workers choose location ==== employment sector—either in agriculture or in non-agriculture. We postulate that agriculture productivity—and therefore agriculture wages—is a function of climate. We also assume that each migrant worker pays a relocation cost which depends on the distance between origin and destination.==== Workers' locational choice determines the demand for housing and the supply of labor at each location; local housing prices and wages in each sector are set by supply-and-demand. As workers migrate in response to the new climate conditions, wages and rents adjust which, in turn, further alter locational choices. Our analysis, therefore, accounts for general equilibrium effects of population re-sorting.====We estimate the parameters of the spatial equilibrium model using a two-step estimation procedure (Berry et al., 2004; Timmins, 2007). In the first step we exploit information on workers' origin available from the 1980 to 2010 decennial population censuses to separately estimate the location-sector specific component of indirect utilities and the migration costs. We postulate that migration costs have a fixed component, capturing a general dislike of moving, and a variable component which depends on the geographic distance between the worker's origin and each potential location. Consistent with previous studies, the first-step estimates reveal that migration costs are sizable.====In the second step, we use the indirect utilities estimated in the first step, along with data on wages, rents, and climate (temperature, rainfall, and sunshine hours), to estimate the marginal utilities of income and climate amenities and the parameters in the equations that characterize the equilibrium in the labor and housing markets. We instrument changes in wages and labor force with measures of local labor demand shocks (Bartik, 1991) and labor market access derived from the model (Morten and Oliveira, 2018). Our estimates of the marginal utility of climate amenities indicate that Brazilians place a higher value on warmer winters than they place on cooler summers—roughly a 33% difference.====We use our estimates to answer questions regarding the impact of warmer temperatures on (i) internal migration and, consequently, the spatial distribution of the workforce; (ii) the share of employment in agriculture; (iii) and the regional distribution of welfare. To carry out the simulations, we use information on future agriculture productivity from the Global Agro-Ecological Zones dataset (GAEZ) and temperature forecasts produced by the National Institute for Space Research (INPE).====The agriculture data are available under current and future climate conditions so we can use the predicted change in yields to estimate how climate change will affect agriculture wages.====We feed data on average temperatures and attainable agriculture yields into our spatial equilibrium model to simulate the counterfactual migration probabilities—and sector choice—and, in turn, the population distribution under future climate scenarios. We then calculate the differences in internal migration flows and regional welfare relative to those prevailing under the current climate. We carry out this exercise under three experiments: (i) considering that climate impacts only the amenity value of locations, (ii) assuming that climate only affects agriculture productivity, and (iii) assessing both channels. We run the simulations under two scenarios: a high-emissions scenario and a low-emissions scenario.====Under the third experiment, the low-emissions scenario yields an aggregate migration rate 9.65% higher than the migration rate under the current climate. Under the first experiment, the change relative to baseline is 49.53% smaller, which highlights the need to account for changes in the agriculture sector wages. The share of employment in agriculture is also affected by climate change: it is 23.2% lower under future climate assuming low emissions, an effect spurred by the losses in agriculture yields.====Turning to the internal migration flow pattern among Brazil's macro-regions, and still considering the low-emissions scenario, we find that nearly 0.9 million more people migrate inter-regionally. Furthermore, climate change will likely deepen existing regional inequalities. The Northeast—one of the poorest regions—is the biggest loser. The region loses about 2.17% of its population to other regions, mostly due to an increase in out-migration to the Southeast; there, expected utility falls. The North and South gain population but in smaller magnitudes. The Southeast—the richest and most industrialized region of the country—and the Midwest—the country's new agriculture frontier—are the biggest winners. These regions gain about 1.09% and 1.26% of their population, respectively; the gain is attributed to an increase in in-migration. They also experience increases in expected utility. These gains might be explained by the fact that several locations that comprise these two regions experience gains in agriculture yields under the new climate, and that winter temperatures rise more than summer temperatures, leading to amenity value gains.====Our simulations indicate that general equilibrium forces are relevant and closely tied to the magnitudes of migration costs. When migration costs are sufficiently low, the initial losses are mitigated by the fall in housing prices in the negatively affected regions as they lose population to other regions. As migration costs rise, however, housing price adjustments matter less because fewer people migrate; in that case, changing sector of employment is the main option to deal with agriculture productivity losses, so that non-agriculture wage adjustments play a major role. Indeed, assuming baseline migration costs, the welfare loss in the Northeast is 17% larger in general equilibrium than in partial equilibrium.====Finally, the regional inequalities resulting from new climate are also linked to migration costs. If these costs are prohibitive, the Northeast bears the largest burden because out-migration is not an option. At the other extreme, if migration is costless, welfare is equalized across regions; under the high-emissions scenario, we find that all regions ==== from climate change as agriculture productivity losses are offset by increases in amenity value. Our simulations also indicate that the geographic distance migration costs are sizable, suggesting that policies that aim to integrate local labor markets could play a major role in mitigating welfare losses in negatively affected regions and regional inequalities in the welfare effects of climate change.====The role of migration as a strategy to cope with climate change has been examined in Findley (1994), Barrios et al. (2006), Saldaña-Zorrilla and Sandberg (2009), Drabo and Mbaye (2014), Marchiori and Schumacher (2011), and Marchiori et al. (2012). Most of these studies, however, focus on partial equilibrium modeling. Our analysis, on the other hand, highlights the importance of general equilibrium effects: ignoring these leads to overestimation of the overall impact of climate change on internal migration.==== Additionally, a large fraction of the literature focuses on extreme events such as earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, and droughts, as opposed to long-term climate change, and do not consider permanent, or lifetime, migration.==== As noted by Baez et al. (2017), people affected by natural disasters normally receive social assistance, usually not available to people affected by long-term changes in climate.====Our paper also relates to another three strands of literature. First, a literature concerned with the estimation of spatial equilibrium models to understand the connection between population sorting and a wide variety of economic phenomena.==== Second, the literature measuring the willingness to pay for climate amenities in developed (Blomquist et al., 1988; Cragg and Kahn. 1997; Maddison and Bigano, 2003; Rehdanz and Maddison, 2009; Sinha et al., 2018; Albouy et al., 2016) and developing countries (Maddison, 2003; Mueller, 2005; Timmins, 2007). Finally, the literature that studies the adaptation strategies to climate change.====This paper is organized as follows.

In the absence of well-defined subsidy eligibility criteria, we demonstrate that areas with a high proportion of individuals of the same ethnicity as the president received more subsidized fertilizer and deforested less compared to areas with other predominant ethnicities. We provide evidence that subsidized fertilizer increased yields and reduced pressure to expand agriculture and that the findings are not confounded by increases in public sector employment or other public assistance programs. The results suggest that policies aimed at increasing small-scale agricultural productivity may have positive environmental ====.","Low agricultural productivity presents a significant barrier to development for much of the world (Barbier and Hochard, 2014). At the same time, tropical deforestation, which has accounted for nearly 10 gigatons of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere between 2000 and 2010 (Baccini et al., 2012), has been largely driven by clearing land for agriculture (Curtis et al., 2018). It is therefore important to understand the underlying relationship between agricultural productivity and deforestation in the developing world. If improvements in agricultural productivity increase the demand for cleared land, development policies aimed at improving small-holder productivity may have negative environmental consequences. However, if increases in productivity allow small holders to delay the need to shift cultivation to new land, these development policies may have positive environmental spillovers.====In this paper, we study the largest public assistance program in Malawi. The program provides fertilizer and seed subsidies to small farmers throughout the country. Malawi is plagued with low land productivity and many small farmers have been unable to afford fertilizer and bio-enhanced seeds at market prices, prompting the government to distribute these items at significantly subsidized prices but in limited quantities. The public provision of these subsidies offers spatial and temporal variation in agricultural productivity within the country, which we use to examine deforestation. The allocation of subsidized seeds and fertilizer did not reach all farmers and there were no strict eligibility criteria for the receipt of the subsidies that can be used for causal estimates.====We leverage ethnic favoritism in subsidy allocation to identify the impacts of improvements in agricultural productivity on deforestation. Particularly, we exploit a change in the ethnicity of the president of Malawi following the 2004 election, and demonstrate that ethnically aligned households are 7–13 percentage points more likely to have access to subsidized fertilizer than households of a different ethnicity and districts with a larger presence of coethnic populaces received more fertilizer per capita, particularly in later years during a period of dramatic expansion of the program. We find that districts with greater coethnic population shares during the expansion of the program experienced greater declines in deforestation relative to others. We estimate that an additional metric tonne of subsidized fertilizer avoids 0.053 ha of deforestation in a given year. We check our identifying assumptions by showing that ethnic alignment with the president is not significantly correlated with a number of potential confounding factors, such as public sector employment, reception of other public assistance programs or infrastructure improvements. We also provide evidence that fertilizer increased maize yields and reduced the pressure for small farmers to expand into marginal lands.====The relationship between agricultural productivity and deforestation is a fundamentally empirical question with important implications for development policies that subsidize agricultural inputs and otherwise encourage the adoption of yield-improving technologies in countries experiencing significant deforestation. Related theoretical models yield mixed results. Economic models of shifting cultivation, such as Takasaki (2006) and Balsdon (2007), predict that improving soil quality and/or land productivity can increase the time a given field is cultivated before shifting to another. In this context, increases in productivity should slow deforestation. However, economic models of land clearing for agriculture, such as Angelsen (1999) - among many others, predict that increasing the returns to agriculture should also increase the amount of land cleared for that purpose. These models would predict increased deforestation as a result of fertilizer subsidies. The effect of these subsidies on deforestation remains an empirical question.====Some empirical studies have evaluated the impacts of development programs on deforestation. Bulte et al. (2007) analyze the relationship between agricultural subsidies and deforestation using cross-country data in Latin America. They find that subsidies are positively correlated with country-level deforestation. However, the subsidies in their analysis are allocated proportional to land in agriculture. This allocation rule creates an additional incentive beyond an increase in productivity for farmers to shift more land from forest to agriculture. The subsidy program in Malawi provides all recipient farmers with an equivalent fertilizer and seed subsidy, which enables us to isolate the effect of increased productivity on a farmer's decision to deforest. Alix-Garcia et al. (2013) examine the effect of conditional cash transfers on deforestation in Mexico and find increased income led to increased consumption of land-intensive goods and more deforestation. We show that a targeted development program to increase agricultural productivity may have the opposite effect found from the cash transfer program studied in their paper.====Chibwana et al. (2013) and Fisher and Shively (2005) examine the effect of Malawi's seed and fertilizer subsidy program on forest extraction and land use. While these papers find evidence that fertilizer and seed subsidies did lead to less direct forest use, they rely on cross-sectional survey data from smaller, more targeted geographic areas. Our paper uses satellite data on deforestation to overcome potential problems with self-reporting of forest clearing. We study the subsidy program across the country and over time and are thus able to present evidence valid over a larger geographic area and our research design allows us to control for time-invariant, location-specific factors that may drive agricultural decisions and forest loss.====The final literatures related to our paper are based in political economy - both the local (within-country) political economy of deforestation literature and the broader literature on ethnic and regional favoritism in public resource allocation. Burgess et al. (2012) and Alesina et al. (2019) study the relationship between local jurisdictional competition, ethnic fragmentation, and deforestation in Indonesia. Burgess et al. (2015) and Hodler and Raschky (2014) demonstrate that ethnic and regional favoritism play a substantial role in allocation of public resources and development in the absence of well-functioning democratic institutions. Jablonski (2014) argues that subnational foreign aid allocations in Kenya are influenced both by ethnic favoritism and electoral considerations. Kramon and Posner (2013) study the role of ethnic favoritism throughout Africa and, while findings vary from country to country, they find evidence that, in Malawi, those sharing the ethnicity of the president in power benefit from improved infant care and educational opportunities. Ejdemyr et al. (2015) examine ethnic favoritism by politicians and targeting of water wells in Malawi. They find that politicians target coethnics, but more so in segregated electoral districts. Dionne and Horowitz (2016) study the political effects of the Malawian fertilizer subsidies and argue there was no targeting in the 2009 allocation at the local (within-village) level. Their cross-sectional analysis relies on within-village variation in ethnicity and focuses on three districts (none of which have a high concentration of coethnic populations with the president at the time). Their finding that coethnic households are not significantly more likely to receive the subsidy is consistent with either low within-village ethnic heterogeneity or the inability to target subsidies at such a fine-scale (within village). Using data from a wider geographic area and over multiple periods, we find evidence of ethnic favoritism in fertilizer subsidies but also suggest that ethnic targeting is done at a higher administrative level, rather than at the household level, at this time.==== While we are not the first to demonstrate ethnic favoritism, we are the first to our knowledge to use favoritism to study the causal effects of a large scale development program.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides important background on Malawi, including a discussion of the role ethnicity plays in resource allocation, the fertilizer subsidy program as well as agriculture and deforestation in this setting. In Section 3 we show that ethnically aligned districts (particularly those aligned in the later part of the sample) receive more fertilizer than non-aligned districts and experienced less deforestation. We use our time-varying alignment measures to instrument for subsidized fertilizer and find a significant, negative relationship between fertilizer and deforestation. We then validate our evidence on favoritism using household survey data from 2003 to 2009, finding households ethnically aligned with the president are significantly more likely to receive fertilizer subsidies. Moreover, we show that household ethnic alignment with the president has limited impact on public sector employment or other forms of public assistance. We also present evidence that ethnically-aligned villages did not experience greater improvements in transportation and electricity access than other villages. We offer suggestive evidence that subsidized fertilizer led to intensification by demonstrating hybrid maize yields improved with increased fertilizer and households who received subsidized fertilizer were more likely to leave some agricultural land in fallow. Section 4 concludes with final remarks and provides a back-of-the envelope calculation of the value of the environmental benefits of avoided deforestation relative to the cost of the subsidy.",Agricultural productivity and deforestation: Evidence from input subsidies and ethnic favoritism in Malawi,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069620300656,19 June 2020,2020,Research Article,230.0

We develop an integrated assessment modeling framework that links ,"Many rural economies depend on the use of natural capital, including forests, land, and water resources. Improving livelihoods while ensuring the ability of future generations to maintain standards of living requires an understanding of the value of physical, human, and natural capital stocks (Arrow et al., 2012), and how they are affected by public policies. For example, groundwater stocks provide a valuable input for agricultural production but are often depleted over time (Fenichel et al., 2016). The common property nature of groundwater suggests that this depletion is unlikely optimal from society's perspective (Hardin, 1968; Walker et al., 1990; Brozović et al., 2010). This has led to surging interest in managing groundwater systems through policies that include well spacing requirements (Stephenson, 1996), restrictions on water use (Drysdale and Hendricks, 2018), and fees for pumping groundwater (Smith, 2018).====Recently, programs that provide incentives for agricultural producers to alter practices have become increasingly common. For example, the USDA's Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) has allocated approximately $1.8 billion per year to programs that offer incentives for agricultural producers to (at least temporarily) cease production on specific land units. The Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP), a subset of the CRP, provides incentive payments to remove irrigated land and water rights from production. Despite the increasing prevalence of incentive-based programs (and their associated costs), surprisingly little is known about the value of the benefits they generate for resource users and society.====To fill this gap, we develop an integrated assessment modeling framework (Keiser and Muller, 2017) that links econometric-based estimates of natural capital values to a spatial-dynamic model of a non-market resource system. We use the model to measure the economic benefits to agricultural producers of a CREP program that pays producers to remove land from production and permanently surrender the associated water right (defined here as ‘water right retirement,’ following Monger et al. (2018) and Tsvetanov and Earnhardt (2020)). This program, in southwest Kansas, retires groundwater rights and leaves higher resource stocks for future use. To calculate program benefits, we propose a novel method that uses responses from a dichotomous choice contingent valuation question to estimate a function that allows the marginal willingness to pay (mWTP) for additional groundwater stock to vary continuously with current stock levels. This econometric marginal benefit function is then linked to a model of the physical groundwater system and used to describe the spatially explicit depreciation of the stock that occurs in the absence of the policy.==== Finally, the linked model is used to estimate the economic benefits associated with higher groundwater stocks after 15, 30, and 50 years of the program.====We find that, without the retirement policy, the benefits from groundwater stocks in the study region decline by $3.6 million over 15 years. Retiring the water rights enrolled in CREP for 15 years results in groundwater levels that are on average 3.2 feet higher than in the no-policy baseline (or 15% of the decline in groundwater levels with no water right retirement), with impacts concentrated in the vicinity of retired water rights. The predicted changes in groundwater stocks across the 4,039 wells of the study region mean that groundwater rights retirement under the CREP program increases the benefits derived from the stock after 15 years by $0.55 million, or 15% of the baseline decrease in value of $3.6 million. Comparing this to an explicit program cost of $45 million that has been committed since 2008 suggests that other social benefits from groundwater stocks must exist to justify the program from a benefit-cost perspective.====This analysis contributes to the economics literature on integrated assessment modeling (Keiser and Muller, 2017) and policy analysis by simulating policy impacts in an environmental system and estimating spatially explicit economic benefits using an econometric-based valuation function that allows the marginal value of a resource to depend on its stock level. This provides a key methodological advance for incorporating economic values into integrated assessment models to value changes in environmental conditions (Keeler et al., 2012).====We use the integrated assessment model to estimate the benefits generated from an increasingly common type of conservation policy that provides incentives for agricultural producers to alter or cease specific production practices. Policies targeting input use (e.g., reducing the use of land, water, fishing boats, etc.) provide an example of a widely-used class of policies employed in the management of common pool resource systems (e.g., vessel buyback programs in fisheries (Clark et al., 2005)). Finally, the tools of non-market valuation can provide a useful avenue to estimate natural resource shadow prices (marginal values) over a range of stock levels. This can facilitate estimation of resource shadow values (the integral under the shadow price function (Fenichel and Hashida, 2019)). This is important, particularly when tradeoffs exist between creating value in the present and maintaining natural capital over time.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we relate our work to the existing literature. Then, we describe the modeling framework and components, empirical setting, how the model components are parameterized, and how we value the benefits of a water right retirement program. Section 4 presents the model results, including the estimated mWTP function, baseline decline in benefits from groundwater, and the increase in value provided by the water right retirement program.

We examine a new external cost of traffic by estimating the relationship between traffic congestion and emergency response times. Matching traffic data at a fine spatial and temporal scale to incident report data from fire departments in California allows us to assign traffic immediately preceding an emergency. Our results show that traffic slows down fire trucks arriving at the scene of an emergency and increases the average monetary damages from fires. The effects are highly nonlinear; increases in response time are primarily due to traffic in the right tail of the traffic distribution. We document an additional externality of traffic congestion and highlight the negative effect of traffic on a critical public good.","According to the National Emergency Number Association, over 240 million 911 calls are placed every year in the United-States.==== Rapidly responding to emergency calls requires an efficient network of first responders and dispatchers. The literature shows that response times for emergency medical services (EMS) are critical for a number of health outcomes including hospitalization, rehabilitation and survival following an accident, stroke or heart attack (Wilde, 2013; Emberson et al., 2014; Jena et al., 2017). Police response times have also been shown to affect crime clearance rates (Blanes i Vidal et al. (2015)). Although first responders are typically expeditious, one factor beyond their control that affects response times is traffic. This is a particularly pressing concern as increasing urbanization has led to more severe congestion in many cities.====In this paper, we examine the relationship between traffic and emergency response times by fire departments in California. In addition to responding to fires, we also have data on fire departments providing EMS and responding to other non-fire emergencies. We match traffic data at a fine spatial and temporal scale to incident report data from fire departments. The fire data consist of over 2.7 million incidents from 2008 to 2015 across California collected by the National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS). The traffic data, collected from the California Department of Transportation, consists of roughly 21 billion observations from 25,000 stations at a 5-min interval resolution. The fine spatial and temporal scale of the traffic data allows us to merge traffic conditions immediately preceding the emergency event by zip code, date, and the time of day. We assign zip code level traffic conditions for every call to the fire department immediately prior to the fire department receiving the alarm. Our identifying assumption is that traffic in a given zip code, in a given month, on a given day of the week, within a given hour is uncorrelated with unobservables affecting emergency response times. This is plausibly exogenous since we use the traffic before the fire/accident occurs. Our final dataset, consists of 1.3 million incidents merged with zip code level traffic conditions.====We make three main contributions to the literature. First, we investigate a new externality of traffic by showing how traffic congestion affects an important public good; the ability of first responders to quickly arrive on the scene of emergencies. While the costs of traffic due to lost time and other externalities are well-documented, we believe it is important to focus on the effect of traffic on emergency response vehicles for two primary reasons. First, conventional economic measures of the time cost of traffic use value of time (VOT), which is often elicited from private drivers paying to increase speed (Small, 2005; Wolff, 2014; Brent and Gross, 2018). However, this ignores emergency response vehicles who do not pay tolls and likely have a vastly higher VOT than private drivers. Second, while conventional drivers are bound by the rules of the road, emergency response vehicles can force drivers to move out of the way, go through traffic lights, and use the road shoulders to avoid traffic. Therefore, it is uncertain whether traffic will slow down emergency response vehicles in the same manner as conventional drivers.====Our second contribution documents how a variety of policies affect both response times and the marginal effect of traffic on response times. This contributes to the growing literature evaluating the effectiveness of transportation policies on congestion and non-congestion traffic externalities such as pollution (Adler and van Ommeren, 2016; Beaudoin and Lin Lawell, 2018; Blackman et al., 2018; Hamilton and Wichman, 2018; Yang et al., 2018; Lalive et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019). Lastly, our third contribution estimates the economic damage imposed by slower response times due to traffic congestion. While most of the economic research on fires focuses on damages from wildfires (Donovan et al., 2007; Moeltner et al., 2013; Mueller et al., 2018; McCoy and Walsh, 2018), our work represents some of the first research on the economic damage of urban fires.====Our results show that traffic slows down fire trucks arriving at the scene of an emergency. This applies both to fire departments responding to fires and providing emergency medical services. Increasing the response time of first responders represents a newly documented externality to traffic, in addition to lost time, pollution, house prices, health, happiness and crime (e.g. Kahneman et al. (2004); Currie and Walker (2011); Anderson (2019), Knittel et al. (2016); Ossokina and Verweij (2015); Anderson et al. (2016) and Beland and Brent (2018)). The effects are highly nonlinear; increases in response times are primarily due to traffic in the right tail of the traffic distribution. For this reason, our main specification focuses on traffic above the 80th percentile. We also find suggestive evidence that fire departments are able to adapt to high traffic, and that unexpected traffic has a larger effect on response times.====Additionally, we investigate road congestion policies (high-occupancy vehicle lanes (HOV), toll roads, public transportation) that might mitigate this problem. We find that HOV lanes partially mitigate the marginal effects of traffic on response time. Lastly, we show evidence that traffic congestion increases the monetary damages of fires. In aggregate, the increased monetary damages from fires and emergency medical services due to traffic are approximately $95-$285 million per year in California, with the majority of costs coming from slower EMS response times. The costs from longer emergency response times are several orders of magnitude lower than other traffic externalities such the value of lost time and extra fuel, which were estimated to be over $40 billion in Californian in 2017 (Schrank et al., 2019). These costs do not account for increased response times for ambulances or police, and therefore should be considered a lower bound for the costs of traffic on emergency response services. Additionally, we do not capture adapting expenditures by fire departments to cope with traffic congestion. Our results are robust to multiple specifications and robustness tests including metro-by-date fixed effects, different definitions of our traffic variable, and relaxing the temporal assumptions for assigning traffic to an emergency.====Our results highlight the importance of an efficient network of first responders, and the complementarity of certain types of public goods (Albouy et al., 2020). Since rapid response by first responders is critical, simply using the value of time, reliability and health effects from pollution will underestimate the costs of traffic congestion. The results also highlight the nonlinear impacts of traffic; similar to other research (Brent and Gross, 2018; Beland and Brent, 2018) the adverse impacts on response times are concentrated in the right tail of the traffic distribution. As urbanization shifts higher shares of the population to cities, it is important to understand the benefits of policies that reduce traffic congestion.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the related literature; Section 3 provides a description of the data and presents descriptive statistics; Section 4 presents the empirical strategy; Section 5 is devoted to the main results, heterogeneity of the impacts and a series of robustness checks; and Section 6 concludes with policy implications.","Traffic congestion, transportation policies, and the performance of first responders",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069620300620,12 June 2020,2020,Research Article,232.0

Phased policy roll-outs offer opportunities for improvement across cohorts and policy effects can grow or decay, especially when natural processes are involved. Focusing on a subset of these factors can lead to erroneous inference, while considering them jointly magnifies specification challenges. To address these challenges, I extend and apply causal forests, a nonparametric method for estimating heterogeneous ====, to simultaneously examine how effects vary across time. I first adapt causal forests to a panel setting with staggered policy introduction by incorporating dynamic selection assumptions and estimators. After illustrating the method's performance on simulated data, I use it to reanalyze how individual quota programs have affected fisheries catches around the world. Estimates reveal substantial heterogeneity and time dependencies and suggest that longer policy exposure may be less beneficial than previously thought. More generally, the approach has potential value for evaluating impacts of a range of ==== as well as environmental shocks.","Understanding who benefits from environmental policies and when those benefits accrue is essential to the evaluation of existing policies and the design and targeting of new ones. Gaining that understanding, however, is no simple task. Heterogeneity is pervasive: programs may induce a range of emissions abatement across firms, changes in ozone concentration across space, or modifications to energy consumption across individuals (Fowlie, 2010; Allcott, 2011; Auffhammer and Kellogg, 2011). Effects may also depend on duration of or time since an intervention, such as a new source of information on water or energy use (Ferraro et al., 2011; Allcott and Rogers, 2014; Martin and Rivers, 2018). Phased policy roll-outs may also result in different effects on those subjected to a policy later rather than earlier as policy implementation evolves (e.g., due to learning). Complicating matters, these factors can also interact: the time profile of policy effects may depend on cross-sectional characteristics like the growth rates of resources or local pollutant dynamics.====Studying policy effects that could vary in so many ways presents empirical challenges. First, identifying even average effects typically entails removing much of the variation in the data, through conditioning on observables, inclusion of fixed effects, use of only instrument-induced variation, or focusing on variation near a discontinuity. With potentially little residual variation remaining, the ability to answer more demanding questions about heterogeneity in policy effects may be limited by statistical power. Second, commonly used methods require pre-specifying how policy effects vary, either by interacting a policy indicator with specific variables in a parametric model, or by partitioning the data into groups and estimating a single average effect (parametrically or not) separately for each subsample. Both routes require important assumptions about the way policy effects vary, codified by choices of interaction terms or by selection of subsamples. Poor choices can lead to erroneous inference, including mistaking heterogeneity for dynamics or dynamics for learning. Estimating several models can help mitigate these issues, but doing so raises concerns about multiple testing and the universe of plausible models is often quite large. This is especially true in high-dimensional settings, where a large number of covariates, as well as policy duration and year of implementation, could modify the effect of the policy.====To address these challenges, I extend and apply a method based on random forests to jointly and nonparametrically examine heterogeneity, dynamics, and evolution of environmental policy effects. The proposed approach combines causal trees and forests (Athey and Imbens, 2016; Wager and Athey, 2018), which are designed for the cross-sectional study of heterogeneous treatment effects, with dynamic treatment frameworks (Lechner, 2002; Lechner and Miquel, 2010). The resulting method offers a unified way to estimate policy effects that vary cross-sectionally, with policy duration, and with the year a policy was introduced. Considering these dimensions jointly reduces the chances of mistaking one type of variation in policy effectiveness for another. Further, in contrast to the standard approaches mentioned above, researchers need not pre-specify the exact way in which the policy effect varies. Instead, causal forests partition the data adaptively based on variation in the treatment effect, effectively using degrees of freedom where they are most informative to aid in detection of heterogeneity and dynamics.====After outlining the approach and evaluating its performance via Monte Carlo exercises, I demonstrate its use by revisiting whether and when a common form of rights-based management – an individual quota (IQ) program – helps avoid resource collapse in fisheries around the world. Costello et al. (2008) examined this question on a global scale using standard panel and propensity score methods, finding that individual quota programs helped reduce the probability of collapse. That study also documented a linear trend in policy effectiveness: IQs in place for longer were more beneficial. Because the forest-based method I present leverages a similar identification strategy, using that study as a baseline allows me to highlight additional insights the new approach can offer.====Applying causal forests to this question paints a rich picture of heterogeneity and evolution of policy effectiveness through time. The estimated effect of IQ management on the probability of collapse among IQ fisheries ranges from a reduction of 11% to an increase of 7%, with an overall mean of 4.5% reduction.==== The most beneficial policy effects occur in earlier implementations, for faster growing species, and in fisheries with higher, less stable catch levels just prior to the policy change. Many of these patterns are consistent with both population dynamics and optimal harvest policy. Previously depleted fisheries with low or no harvest may be optimally closed when IQ management begins (Reed, 1979), yielding apparent continuation of collapse. In addition, fisheries with high, stable catches prior to IQ adoption may already have managed harvests effectively (e.g. via fleet-wide quotas), such that the gains from IQ management are primarily economic rather than biological.====Collectively, the causal forest estimates also imply that the relationship between policy duration and impact is weaker than previously thought (Costello et al., 2008). In short, duration is correlated with policy start year as well as cross-sectional dimensions, and a model interacting treatment with duration alone may conflate dynamics with heterogeneity or changing implementations. To be clear, the intuition that duration may be confounded as a moderator of policy effects does not require causal forests and can be illustrated with simple parametric models (see Section 4.5.1). However, causal forests allow for flexible detection of variation in policy effects, so that the limited role of duration they uncover in this context strengthens insights from parametric models (see the online-only appendix, section S3 for an illustration).====Together, the approach and application offer three primary contributions. The first is methodological: I extend causal forests (Wager and Athey, 2018) to examine not only heterogeneity in policy effects, but also how those effects depend upon duration and time of first exposure. The modification leverages inverse probability of treatment weighting based on a dynamic treatment framework and associated conditional independence assumption (Robins et al., 2000; Lechner, 2002; Lechner and Miquel, 2010). The resulting method offers a unified approach to estimation of treatment effects that vary cross-sectionally, with duration, and with time of first exposure. Variation in effects across the time dimensions is, of course, quite different than cross-sectional heterogeneity, reflecting differences across exposures rather than varying responses to a single exposure. However, the unified approach allows for straightforward investigation of all three dimensions and their interactions.==== Prior applied work has used causal forests only to examine cross-sectional heterogeneity, relying on pre-selection of different intervals to examine the role of duration (Bertrand et al., 2017).====The resulting method complements a literature examining nonparametric estimation of treatment effect heterogeneity. Recent examples leverage modified support vector machines (Imai and Ratkovic, 2013), least absolute selection and shrinkage operator (LASSO) estimators (Tian et al., 2014), Bayesian approaches (Taddy et al., 2016), and kernel regression (Abrevaya et al., 2015). While promising, those studies focus on heterogeneity alone and do not consider dynamics. Simpler approaches, such as on estimating conditional means of counterfactual outcomes via kernel regression, also have value. With appropriate covariate-specific and locally-adaptive bandwidths (e.g Racine and Li, 2004; Li and Racine, 2004; Hall et al., 2007), that approach would base estimates on local neighborhoods in a manner similar to regression trees. Importantly, the tree-based methods presented here adapt to variation in the estimated policy effect rather than the shape of the counterfactual functions themselves. Since the treatment effect may vary when one counterfactual does not, and the treatment effect may be constant when both counterfactuals are highly variable, the adaptivity of causal forests appears attractive.====As a second contribution, the estimated fisheries policy effects add to a large literature examining the effectiveness of individual quota programs. Of most direct relevance, many researchers have posited heterogeneity or studied it using conventional parametric methods, associating effectiveness with robustness of quotas (Mora et al., 2009), biological characteristics of the targeted species (Pinkerton and Edwards, 2009), country development (Ban et al., 2009), and the health of the fishery prior to adoption of individual quotas (Costello and Grainger, 2018).==== Costello et al. (2008) also examine the role of policy duration but allow only linear trends; as explained above, those trends may partly reflect other forms of heterogeneity and changing effectiveness. A recent contribution from Isaksen and Richter (2019) confirms the general findings of Costello et al. (2008), and investigates several forms of heterogeneity using pre-specified sample splits, examining one dimension at a time. Non-causal regression trees and random forests have been used to identify fishery characteristics which predict favorable outcomes (Gutiérrez et al., 2011; Melnychuk et al., 2016), but not to estimate policy effects in a causal framework.==== The results here complement those studies, highlighting potential nonlinearities and interactions in individual quota program effectiveness through use of causal forests. In particular, the causal forest approach strengthens evidence of confounding among policy effect modifiers suggested by both intuition and parametric models.====Beyond any insights specific to individual quota programs, the paper's third contribution is illustration of the application of (modified) causal forests to a question in the environmental domain. Causal forests have been adopted somewhat more rapidly in other fields, e.g., to study cross-sectional heterogeneity in effectiveness of summer jobs programs (Davis and Heller, 2017), wearable health gadgets (Handel and Kolstad, 2017), and public works employment (Bertrand et al., 2017). In the environmental realm, Prest (2017) examines individual electricity use in response to time-of-use pricing. However, none of these studies uses the proposed approach to jointly examine how policy effects depend on cross-sectional characteristics, duration, and start time.====The illustrative fisheries example highlights many features common across a range of empirical environmental work, and hence the potentially broad applicability of the approach. First, many environmental policies take effect in a staggered fashion, whether because different jurisdictions autonomously enact or modify the stringency of policies (e.g., Gallagher and Muehlegger, 2011), a federal government gradually cedes enforcement responsibility to more local levels (e.g., Grooms, 2015), or environmental conditions surpass key policy thresholds at different times across space (e.g., Auffhammer et al., 2009). Second, because environmental systems often exhibit natural dynamics due to decay or resource growth, the ability to examine time-varying policy effects is paramount. Many of those dynamics are nonlinear, so that even in low-dimensional settings like the fisheries application I examine, the flexibility afforded by causal forests should prove valuable.==== Further, data rich, micro-level studies can even better leverage the value of causal forests in higher dimensions than is illustrated in the fisheries application here. Finally, while I focus on environmental policy analysis, the proposed method is equally applicable for quantifying effects of environmental shocks that exhibit both heterogeneity and dynamics, as in White (2017).====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section, I briefly review causal trees and forests, then describe how they can be extended to examine variation across time. I then validate the resulting approach on simulated data before applying it to study the effectiveness of individual quota programs in fisheries. The final section concludes.",Causal forest estimation of heterogeneous and time-varying environmental policy effects,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069620300607,30 May 2020,2020,Research Article,233.0

We exploit Constances, a novel population-based cohort that combines respondents' full medical history, elicited using face-to-face interviews with physicians, with respondents' work history, extracted from administrative records. Focusing on blue-collar males, aged between 20 and 59 years of age, we find an average VSL estimate of at least 6.5 million euros. Our results suggest that VSL decreases with age and with better baseline health.","All humans face a wide array of risks to health and life induced by environmental and other factors, but they differ in their valuations of wealth, health and life. It seems reasonable to expect that individuals' valuations for reducing risks to health and life depend on personal characteristics. That is, for a similar life- or health-risk reduction, the gains may not be valued in the same way by young (healthy) individuals compared to older (less healthy) ones. Thus, the willingness to pay (WTP) for a small mortality risk reduction, namely the Value per Statistical Life (VSL), may depend on the context in which it is valued. By combining a data set of French industry-related mortality risks, along with a population-based panel containing individuals' medical and work history, we provide one of the first revealed preference study (RP) investigating the relationship between VSL, age and baseline health.====As VSL is a key statistic used to measure the benefits of mortality risk reductions generated by public policies, it is important to both researchers and policy-makers across many fields of application. Yet, adopting a context-dependent VSL estimate for benefits' valuation may prove highly controversial. For instance, the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) decision to use an age-adjusted VSL was strongly criticized by members of the general public,==== and the agency quickly withdrew its proposal. Similarly, in their guidance on impact assessment, the European Commission and the UK Treasury recommended using context-specific VSL estimates, with higher estimates for a particular health condition (cancer), because of the devastating nature of the disease (European Commission 2001; HM Treasury, 2003); a decision that has not generated the same public attention as in the US EPA's case.====Insights from theory, however, suggest that VSL may vary with age and baseline health. Yet, there is no agreement as to how VSL varies with respect to each dimension. The sign and magnitude of the effects of age and baseline health on VSL are ambiguous. Some models predict that VSL should decline steadily with age (Jones-Lee, 1989), while others suggest that the age/VSL relationship could either be increasing, decreasing or even independent of age (Johansson, 2002; Aldy and Viscusi, 2004; and Ehrlich and Yin, 2005). Theoretical models linking VSL with health also predict ambiguous results (Hammitt, 2002; Bleichrodt and Eeckhoudt, 2006; Rheinberger et al., 2016). In this paper, we present a simple theoretical framework that combines quality-of-life (defined here as a single index function which combines individuals' longevity with their health) and wealth dimensions. In line with previous theoretical models, we find ambiguous results. In the absence of clear theoretical predictions, the relationship between VSL, age and baseline health therefore remains an empirical question.====From an empirical perspective, most of the literature focusing on the link between age, health and VSL is based on stated preferences (SP). An asset of these methods is the ability to combine health-related information with individuals' trade-offs between wealth and mortality risks. SP methods consist of presenting individuals with hypothetical choices. They include contingent-valuation methods and discrete-choice experiments (Bateman et al., 2002). Alberini et al. (2004), provide an empirical assessment of the effects of age and baseline health on WTP for mortality risk reductions by reporting the results of two contingent valuation surveys. They find weak support for the hypothesis that WTP declines with age, cardio-vascular disease, lung disease, and cancer. Cameron and DeShazo (2013) estimate a structural model with survey data, allowing them to infer how WTP estimates for reductions in the risks of sick-years and lost life-years depend upon the individual's age, income, marginal utility of other consumption, and discount rate. They find a positive marginal utility associated with income and a negative marginal utility associated with the logarithms of present discounted sick-years, and lost life-years.====Using a RP method, there is a large body of literature assessing the relationship between VSL and age. For example, Viscusi and Aldy (2003) use an age-dependent fatality risk measure to estimate age-specific hedonic wage regressions. They find that VSL exhibits an inverted-U-shaped relationship with age. Hedonic wage studies generally support a flat or inverted U-shaped age-VSL relationship (O'Brien, 2018).==== However, there is some variation. Evans and Schaur (2010) propose a quantile regression approach to provide insights into the relevance of earnings and age variation for VSL estimates. They find a decreasing relationship between age and VSL.====In contrast, to the best of our knowledge, the literature based on RP methods to value health related-risks in a VSL context is thin. Gayer et al. (2002) examine the effect on housing prices of cancer risks from chemical exposures from hazardous waste sites. In a similar study, Davis (2004) exploits a natural experiment to assess the marginal WTP to avoid a statistical case of pediatric leukemia risk. Gentry and Viscusi (2016) propose a methodological framework to distinguish the fatality and morbidity components of VSL. They show that VSL can be separated into two additive components: the morbidity associated with fatal injuries and the fatality per-se, providing the first RP estimates distinguishing both effects.====This article extends the existing literature by examining the effects of baseline health and age on VSL. We use individual level data on demographic characteristics from Constances, a large population-based cohort in France. It is a nationally representative sample of adults, which includes information on age, sex, medical history, and professional career. Constances matches detailed individuals' characteristics with their professional history. Annual information is collected on gross wages, the number of equivalent quarters worked per year and occupation, as well as firm and industry identifiers. For our analysis, we follow the VSL literature and focus on blue-collar males, aged between 20 and 59 years of age. Using industry identifiers, we link the Constances cohort with data on work-related mortality risks from the French National Health Insurance Fund. This publicly available data gathers information on accidents from all French workers who are covered by the National Technical Committee (NTC). It contains information on the total number of full-time equivalent workers (FTE), the number of hours worked, and the number of deaths on an annual basis per industry.====To identify the effects of age and baseline health on VSL, we use cross-sectional variations as starting point followed by panel variations. The cross-sectional analysis has a comparative advantage over the second in that Constances' wide range of variables allows us to control for a large range of potentially confounding factors that would otherwise lead to biased estimates. This large array of controls, however, is not available through time and cannot be used in the panel setting. On the other hand, panel data allows for more observations, while still controlling for unobserved time-invariant individual characteristics. The identification strategy exploits individual-level health variations, defined as the age of onset of either a cardio-vascular disease or a cancer, along with job changes, to identify the effect that baseline health may have on VSL.====Our results suggest that the average VSL estimate is close to 6.5 million euros (in 2015 euros), which is similar to recent RP-based estimates from fatalities at work.==== Early compensating differential studies on fatalities at work found weak evidence of a risk premium for riskier jobs (Fairris, 1989; Dorman and Hagstrom, 1998). More recently, Viscusi (2004), using the U.S. BLS Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI) finds a VSL of 7.5 million dollars (in 2000 dollars), which corresponds to 9.4 million euros (in 2015 euros). Using the U.S. Census Bureau's Census of Manufacturers along with a quasi-experimental setting based on random safety inspections, Lee and Taylor, 2019 find VSL values between 8 and 10 million dollars (in 2016 dollars), which corresponds to 7.1 to 8.9 million euros (in 2015 euros).====In addition, our results suggest that VSL decreases with better baseline health. In our panel specification, we find that individuals with a cardio-vascular disease require more compensation than healthy individuals for a similar mortality risk exposure. However, we find weak evidence that individuals with cancer would require a larger compensation. Individuals with cancer who are less than 50 years of age require greater compensation than healthy individuals for a similar exposure to mortality risk, while those older than 50 years require less compensation. Moreover, our results suggest that VSL decreases with age. VSL estimates range from close to 11 million euros for individuals below 30, to at least 4.6 million euros for those above 30 (in 2015 euros). Our study, however, suffers from the same limitations as other hedonic wage studies. In particular, it does not capture preferences of those individuals who remain outside the study sample.====Another such limitation is the error in measuring precisely the fatality risks faced by individuals. We address the issue of measurement error in several ways. Since, the fatality rates are not by industry or occupation alone, we proxy blue-collar workers fatality rate based on 720 industry cells. We use eight-year averages to reduce the influence of random year-to-year fluctuations (Viscusi, 2004; Kniesner et al., 2012). Our paper also explores adjacent observation differences to reduce the influence of measurement error (Griliches and Hausman, 1986; Kniesner et al., 2012). Finally, we examine how instrumental variable estimates attenuate the measurement error bias.====The structure of this paper is as follows. In the next section, we develop a theoretical model on the relationship between VSL and age/baseline health. In Section 3, we describe the data sets used for the empirical analyses. In Sections 4 Empirical specification, 5 Results, we describe the empirical implementation and the results, respectively. In section 6, we present results from robustness checks.

We study a new flaring regulation in North Dakota and document its efficiency. We attribute most of the observed flaring reductions at new wells in the state since late 2014 to the regulation. We construct firm-specific marginal abatement cost curves and find that the same quantity of flaring reductions could have been achieved at 44% lower cost by taxing flared gas instead of imposing firm-specific requirements. Taxing flared gas at the existing public lands royalty rate would achieve 99% of the flaring reductions at 46% lower cost.,"A necessary condition for cost-effective regulation is that marginal compliance costs are equal across regulated sources. Environmental regulations that achieve this condition include pollution taxes and cap and trade programs. Existing environmental policies frequently deviate from this central economic principle. Quantifying the gains from moving to a more efficient regulation is often not possible since doing so requires knowledge of firms’ marginal abatement cost (MAC) curves, which are difficult to recover. Those studies that do estimate MAC curves find that gains from trade can be substantial. Carlson et al. (2000) study the SO==== emissions trading program under Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and find that annual compliance costs were $800 million (43%) lower with trading compared to a uniform standard. Fowlie et al. (2012) document substantial differences in NO==== abatement costs across the electricity and transportation sectors and estimate that equating MACs across the two sectors would reduce total compliance costs by $1.6 billion (6%).====We study the impacts and efficiency of a new natural gas flaring regulation in North Dakota. North Dakota’s Bakken shale formation is valued primarily for its vast unconventional oil deposits. However, when firms extract oil, their wells also produce valuable natural gas and natural gas liquid (NGL) co-products. In the absence of pipeline infrastructure, these co-products are flared: burned at the well site (Swanson, 2014). Flaring has become an acute problem in unconventional oil fields in the US because of the explosion in production over the past decade. Despite the rapid growth in oil production, infrastructure to capture and process associated natural gas has lagged. In July 2014, the North Dakota Industrial Commission (NDIC) passed Commission Order 24,665 to reduce gas flaring in the state. The regulation established some of the most aggressive flaring standards in the US, and other regulatory agencies have closely followed its progress (Storrow, 2015).====Order 24,665 requires well operators in North Dakota to capture a minimum percentage of gas produced by all their wells, with the ultimate objective of capturing 91% of produced gas in the state by 2020. Several features of the regulation indicate it is inefficient. First, each firm operating in North Dakota must individually comply with the gas capture target. If operators have different costs of capturing gas, marginal costs will differ across operators and, by the equimarginal principle, the policy will not achieve the target at least-cost. Second, firms must meet the same flaring standard every month. If marginal abatement costs change over time due to expanding pipeline infrastructure or firms drilling new wells, firms may inefficiently allocate abatement intertemporally. Gas capture regulations have been identified as among the most challenging and costly regulations for oil-producing firms to comply with (Zirogiannis et al., 2016), so the costs of abatement misallocation may be substantial.====We first characterize the impact of the NDIC regulation using two research designs. The first compares flaring at wells completed before and after October 2014, controlling for observable differences in economic conditions and gas capture infrastructure. The second is a difference-in-differences research design where our control group is the set of wells on Montana’s side of the Bakken, which were not subject to the North Dakota flaring order. Our difference-in-differences estimates indicate that the regulation decreased flaring rates by 14–20 percentage points over the first year of production at new wells, accounting for 80% to all of the observed flaring reductions in the state in the 21 months after the regulation became effective compared to the year before enactment. We also explore the mechanisms underlying the flaring reduction and find that firms complied with the regulation through a combination of connecting to gas capture infrastructure more quickly and curtailing production.====Next, we study the efficiency of the policy by constructing firm-specific MAC curves. We use detailed pipeline location data to measure the distance between wells and the nearest pipeline. We then use engineering cost estimates to construct on-site and pipeline infrastructure costs for each well pad and aggregate the costs to construct firm and industry MAC curves. Our model’s predictions of firms’ gas capture connection decisions in response to the regulation closely match firm behavior observed in the data. We use the estimated cost curves to simulate several counterfactual policies that achieve the same aggregate flaring reductions that we observe from October 2014 to June 2016, the first 21 months of the regulation.====We document substantial heterogeneity in abatement costs both across firms and over time. In our preferred counterfactual, reallocating abatement could achieve the same gas capture at 44% lower cost over the first 21 months of the regulation. This results in $489 million in savings, approximately 5% of oil and gas revenues over the timespan of the counterfactual exercise. Most of the efficiency gains come from equating marginal abatement costs across firms. The state could realize these savings by taxing flared gases at $0.55/mcf.==== To put the value in perspective, the average public lands royalty rate on gas revenues over this period was around $0.45/mcf. Alternatively, this amounts to a carbon tax of about $10/tCO====, below current estimates of the social cost of carbon.====Regulators have several incentives to limit flaring. First, flaring is associated with environmental externalities. Worldwide, flaring results in 300 million tons of CO==== emissions each year (World Bank, 2015), equivalent to the emissions of 65 million cars (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2018). Flaring also emits NO====, SO====, and aromatic hydrocarbons that are linked to cardiovascular disease and increased prevalence of cancer. Second, flaring results in economic losses to lease-owners and the government since flared gases are rarely subject to royalty payments and taxes. Lost value due to flaring in the Permian basin was recently valued at over $1 million per day (Elliott, 2018).====Federal and state agencies have passed or considered several regulations to reduce the practice. The EPA considered rules to regulate flaring and methane emissions (Bureau of Land Management, 2016), the Bureau of Land Management considered regulations on methane flaring and leaks (Bureau of Land Management, 2016), and the Fish and Wildlife Service considered regulating hydraulically fractured wells drilled on and near protected habitats. Many of these proposals have been weakened under the Trump administration. The BLM largely rescinded its flaring regulations, in 2018 the Department of the Interior moved to repeal existing regulations on venting and flaring natural gas on federal lands (Friedman, 2018), and the EPA proposed weakening regulations on methane leak inspections and repairs (Davenport, 2018).====Our work contributes to a growing literature studying the impacts of the shale revolution. Previous work has documented the health and pollution impacts of fracing (Olmstead et al., 2013; Hill, 2015), how nearby drilling is capitalized into housing values (Gopalakrishnan and Klaiber, 2014; Muehlenbachs et al., 2015; Bartik et al., 2017), the efficiency of landowner-firm leases (Vissing, 2016), the supply elasticity of fraced versus conventional wells (Newell et al., 2019), and the economic and welfare impacts of these newly reachable resources (Hausman and Kellogg, 2015; Feyrer et al., 2017). Recently others have studied firm decision-making (Covert, 2015; Agerton, 2018; Fetter, 2018; Steck, 2018; Lange and Redlinger, 2019), the costs and regulation of methane emissions in the production and distribution sectors (Marks, 2018; Hausman and Muehlenbachs, 2019), the effects of environmental regulations on firms in the industry (Muehlenbachs, 2015; Fetter et al., 2018; Boomhower, 2019), the extent to which flaring has been misreported (Lee, 2018), and flaring’s health effects (Blundell and Kokoza, 2018).====We contribute more generally to a large literature studying efficient regulation. Environmental economists have long advocated for moving from command-and-control to market-based policies. The theoretical efficiency of market-based instruments is well established (Montgomery, 1972; Baumol and Oates, 1988), but empirical measurement of the associated efficiency gains has been limited (Carlson et al., 2000; Kerr and Newell, 2003; Fowlie et al., 2012).====We proceed as follows. In Section 2, we describe oil production in the Bakken, the institutional and regulatory setting in the state, and the North Dakota flaring regulation. In Section 3, we develop a model of firm decision-making to clarify the margins by which firms may respond to the regulation and motivate our structural exercise. Section 4 describes the data and provides summary statistics. We describe our empirical strategy and present results for the effects of the regulation on firms’ flaring in Section 5. Section 6 constructs firm-specific marginal abatement cost curves and counterfactual flaring scenarios.

Much micro-econometric evidence suggests that precipitation has wide ranging impacts on vital economic indicators such as agricultural yields, human capital and even conflict. And yet paradoxically most macro-econometric evidence (especially in the climate economics literature) finds that precipitation has no robust and significant impact on various measures of aggregate economic output. Here, we argue that spatial aggregation of weather at the country level explains this result. We use annual sub-national GDP data to show a concave relationship between precipitation and local GDP growth between 1990 and 2014. We demonstrate that when data are aggregated at larger spatial scales, the significance of the impact decreases and eventually it vanishes. The impact of precipitation on aggregate economic activity is predominantly felt in developing countries and is insignificant in developed countries. Agriculture is found to be a key pathway. Our results have substantial consequences for measuring the economic impact of climate change.","Few would deny that water, as a necessity for life, is central to all forms of economic activities. And yet attempts to quantify its contribution to economic growth remain elusive and uncertain. The earliest efforts to establish such links relied upon simple correlations between rainfall and economic growth. Charts showing co-movements of rainfall and GDP growth are still presented as prima facia evidence of a link between the availability of water and economic growth by the World Bank and others (World Bank, 2006). While perhaps a useful tool for policy discourse, such correlations provide little information about causal patterns.====More recently a number of papers have attempted to investigate the effects of either rainfall or water availability on economic growth. Two canonical papers in the growing climate economy literature empirically examine the joint effects of rainfall and temperature changes on aggregate economic outcomes (Dell et al., 2012; Burke et al., 2015 – hereafter DJO and BHM). After many robustness checks, both papers conclude that there is little discernible, robust evidence that rainfall has a statistically significant and consistent impact on GDP growth. However, temperature is shown to have a consistent and non-linear effect on GDP growth, with productivity being maximized at 13 °C in BHM. Following this pioneering work, a series of new papers have explored the impacts of temperature on both the growth and level of GDP (Newell et al., 2018; Kahn et al., 2019; Tol, 2019, Deryugina and Solomon, 2017; Diffenbaugh and Burke, 2019; Henseler and Schumacher, 2019; Burke and Tanutama, 2019). A typical finding is that temperature has negative economic impacts, but precipitation has no consistent and statistically significant impact.====To our knowledge there are only four recent papers that seek to specifically explore whether rainfall has an impact on aggregate economic activity at a global scale (Barrios et al., 2010; Brown et al., 2013; El Khanji and Hudson, 2016; Sadoff et al., 2016 – See Table Sup 1).==== These studies use national data to investigate whether rainfall has identifiable impacts on aggregated economic activity. Only Brown et al. (2013) find that precipitation affects GDP growth, noting that both dry and wet episodes of rainfall lead to a decline in per capita GDP growth rates. Surprisingly they find no impact on agricultural GDP growth, though it is the sector that is most affected by rainfall. None of the other papers find a robust relationship between the chosen measure of precipitation or water availability (which varies across papers) and indicators of economic growth. A recent study by Ortiz-Bobea et al. (2019) suggests that the correlation between dry and hot conditions could mask the impact of rainfall in studies where temperature, and not rainfall, has the largest impact. The study proposes an alternative measure of water availability by way of soil moisture. Further details are provided in Sup 1.====In contrast there is an extensive microeconometric literature which convincingly finds causal impacts between precipitation and agriculture (Auffhammer et al., 2006; Fishman, 2016; Lesk et al., 2016; Zaveri et al., 2020); industry and firm performance (Islam and Hyland, 2018); urban growth (Desbureaux and Rodella, 2019), and health (Maccini and Yang, 2009; Hyland and Russ, 2019).====Here, we argue that spatial aggregation of weather data at the country level explains why impacts of precipitation on GDP are found to be fragile and inconsistent at the macroeconomic level and yet are found to have powerful economic effects at the level of individual sectors. Rainfall and water availability exhibit spatial variability that is considerably higher than that of temperature (Lobell and Asseng, 2017). Indeed, the wettest areas in Alaska (4,880  mL year====) received 4,830 mL more precipitation on average per year between 1990 and 2014 than the Mojave Desert (52  mL year====). Such differences are also observed in the major urban centers of the USA with a difference of 1,800  mL year==== near Miami, Florida and 72  mL year==== in the Coachella Valley, California. And even higher spatial variability between the driest and wettest area is found in India (10,083  mL year====), Colombia (7,138  mL year====), Peru (6,518  mL year====) or Papua New-Guinea (6,476  mL year====). Temperature also varies within countries (e.g., a 40 °C difference between the coldest parts of Alaska and Miami, Florida) but globally, the within-country coefficient of variation is twice as large for precipitation than it is for temperature. Aggregation masks heterogeneity of impacts across regions (Barrios et al., 2010) -- a problem termed Modifiable Areal Unit Problem, or MAUP in the economic geography literature (Briant et al., 2010). More heterogeneity is lost for precipitation than for temperature in studies at the country level, causing important statistical distortions that have direct impacts on the results.====We demonstrate that highly aggregated statistical models may underestimate the impact of rainfall due to measurement error, since rainfall is spatially heterogenous, and much more so than temperature. We use recent global sub-national aggregated output data (Kummu, Taka and Guillaume, 2018a) derived from Gennaioli et al. (2013) and show a robust impact of rainfall on local GDP growth between 1990 and 2014. Following the literature, we use fixed effects panel regressions to isolate the impact of weather variables from time invariant factors or common time-varying factors that could be correlated with both weather and aggregate economic outputs.====At the smallest spatial resolution available (0.5°), we find a concave relationship between precipitation and GDP per capita growth. Rainfall increases total economic productivity at a decreasing rate, till it reaches a peak beyond which the marginal economic return declines with additional rainfall. The impact of temperature is in line with previous findings at a small spatial scale (e.g., BHM 2015). We then demonstrate that as the data are aggregated to larger spatial scales, the significance of the impact of precipitation becomes smaller until it ultimately disappears when the spatial unit is the country level. These results suggest the need for spatial disaggregation to capture local heterogeneity.====Our results further indicate that the relationship between rainfall and GDP growth is sharper in low income countries. However, in contrast, economic activity remains affected by temperatures in the developed economies. As a likely mechanism, we show that the relationship between precipitation and GDP growth is stronger in cells with large areas of cropland.",Does rainfall matter for economic growth?

In theory, such vintage differentiated regulation could reduce demand for new vehicles, which would reduce the social welfare gains of tighter standards. Using household data from 1996 to 2016, which includes periods of stable standards and periods of tightening standards, we provide the first direct evidence of the effects of standards on new vehicle purchases. Tighter standards induce statistically and economically significant reductions in new vehicle purchases, which raises welfare costs of tighter standards modestly.","Many consumer durable goods, such as refrigerators and air conditioners, are subject to energy efficiency or greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions standards. Typically, these standards apply to products when they are first sold to consumers, and they specify either energy efficiency or emissions rate standards such as a refrigerator’s annual kilowatt hours of electricity consumption. Used products (that is, those of an earlier vintage) are subject to weaker standards or no standards at all. Passenger vehicles are a prominent example of this form of vintage differentiated regulation of consumer products. Most new passenger vehicles sold globally are subject to fuel economy or GHG emissions standards, and many countries are tightening standards as part of their efforts to reduce GHG emissions. After the vehicles are first purchased, they are not subject to fuel economy or GHG standards, either when a vehicle’s registration is renewed, or the vehicle is sold.====From a consumer’s perspective, new and used products are imperfect substitutes for one another. Consequently, regulating new but not existing products can affect consumer demand for new products (Stavins, 2006).==== In theory, setting energy efficiency standards for new but not used products can increase or decrease aggregate new product demand. Tighter standards raise the relative cost of producing the new products, raising prices of new products. If the unregulated market provides the privately optimal level of efficiency, tighter standards will reduce aggregate new product sales, raising demand for secondhand products and delaying scrappage of older products (Gruenspecht, 1982; Jacobsen and van Benthem, 2015). On the other hand, if, due to a market failure, the unregulated market underprovides energy efficiency from consumers’ perspectives, consumers may value the efficiency gains more than the price increases. In that case, standards could increase aggregate sales of new products (NHTSA , 2012 and Houde and Spurlock 2016).====Potentially, there are two main welfare implications if tighter passenger vehicle fuel economy and GHG standards reduce aggregate new vehicle sales. First, as the literature has recognized, as standards tighten over time, new vehicles have higher fuel economy and lower GHG emissions than older vehicles. Therefore, lower new vehicle sales would undermine some of the fuel savings and GHG reductions caused by tighter standards.====The second effect, which the previous literature has not discussed, is that because vehicle manufacturers typically earn a markup to recover fixed costs of vehicle design and production (Berry et al., 1995), lower vehicle sales can reduce profits in the short run. In fact, many manufacturers claim this has occurred during recent tightening of passenger vehicle standards. In proposing to weaken federal fuel economy and GHG standards, the Trump administration argues that higher new vehicle prices reduce total sales (EPA and NHTSA US Environmental Protection Agency and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 2018).====Despite the possible welfare effects of vintage differentiated regulation of consumer products, we are not aware of any direct empirical evidence of the effects of vintage differentiated regulation on aggregate sales of new products. Jacobsen and van Benthem (2015) estimate the effects of gasoline prices on vehicle scrappage, but they do not estimate the effects of vehicle ==== on new vehicle purchases. The second welfare effect occurs independently of the scrappage effect. Other articles on the welfare effects of standards either assume away changes in aggregate new vehicle sales (e.g., Goldberg, 1998; Klier and Linn, 2012) or calibrate structural models to observed equilibriums rather than estimate parameters from observed effects of standards on consumer choices (e.g., Jacobsen, 2013). This lack of empirical evidence on standards contrasts with the substantial evidence on consumer responses to fuel prices.====Focusing on US passenger vehicles, we provide the first evidence that vintage differentiated regulation of consumer products affects purchases of new and used products, and we quantify two welfare implications of those effects. Hypothetically increasing standards by 1 percent (0.2 miles per gallon, mpg) in the year 2016 would have reduced new vehicle purchases by 0.4 percent, or about 70,000 units. The lower number of purchases reduces manufacturer profits and represents a deadweight loss that would raise the welfare costs of achieving tighter standards by 24 percent. This cost has not been considered previously either in the literature or in the regulatory agencies’ benefit-cost analysis. However, even after including these costs the estimated benefits of tightening the standards exceeds the costs.====Next, we outline the paper in more detail. After describing the data in Section 2, in Section 3 we present estimates of the effects of new vehicle standards on new vehicle purchases. We test the hypothesis that tightening the stringency of the standards reduces new vehicle sales. We model the effect of stringency on equilibrium vehicle purchases, without estimating the vehicle price changes.====The empirical analysis uses recent variation in fuel economy standards and a novel data set of household-level purchase decisions from 1996 through 2016. We collect data on about 150,000 households from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX), which includes household demographics and detailed information about the vehicles they obtained, including both new vehicle purchases and used vehicle purchases. We combine the CEX data with gasoline prices from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and vehicle attributes from Wards Auto.====We follow Klier and Linn (2010, 2016) in measuring the stringency of the fuel economy standards for each vehicle in the data. For new vehicles, stringency is defined as the log ratio of the fuel economy requirement the vehicle faces and the vehicle’s actual fuel economy. The variable is defined to be a proxy for the shadow cost on fuel economy that the standards create. We test whether the average stringency of new vehicles in a particular year affects total new vehicle purchases.====Tightening the standards reduces new vehicle purchases. The results are robust to adding additional controls for demand and supply shocks that could be correlated with the stringency variation in the data.====A virtue of the estimation equation is that we can use the coefficient estimates to quantify two welfare implications of the effect of stringency on aggregate new vehicle sales. We consider tighter standards in 2016, the final year of our sample. Maintaining the assumptions made by the regulatory agencies on the relationship between aggregate new vehicle sales and the entire stock of vehicles, the reduction in aggregate new vehicle purchases reduces fuel economy and GHG benefits by 0.4 percent, which is a small amount.====The decline in aggregate new vehicle purchases substantially reduces short-run manufacturer profits. The lower profits constitute a cost to manufacturers besides the direct costs of adding fuel-saving technologies to meet tighter standards. Accounting for the reduction in aggregate new vehicle purchases raises costs of tighter standards by 24 percent and reduces net benefits (the difference between benefits and costs) by 44 percent. (Note that this estimate does not require any assumptions on the vehicle stock mentioned above.) Despite the higher costs, net benefits of tighter standards in 2016 remain positive according to our calculations. For reasons we discuss in Section 4, the lower profits persist only in the short run, up to about five years after standards are tightened.====By providing the first direct estimates of the effects of vintage differentiated regulation of consumer products, our analysis complements recent papers that analyze the aggregate welfare and distributional consequences of standards and taxes. Jacobsen and van Benthem (2015) is perhaps most closely related to our analysis. They estimate the effects of used vehicle prices on scrappage and use a calibrated model to estimate the effects of standards on new vehicle purchases as well as scrappage of used vehicles. In contrast, we directly estimate the effects of standards on new vehicle purchases and do not analyze scrappage. We believe our analysis is the first to quantify the short-run reduction in manufacturer profits caused by the decline in purchases. This effect occurs in addition to the higher emissions caused by delayed scrappage in Jacobsen and van Benthem (2015).====Our results also have implications for the recent literature on the distributional effects of tighter standards (e.g., Davis and Knittel, 2017; Levinson, 2016). We do not find strong evidence that substitution from new vehicles caused by tighter standards is systematically correlated with income.",How do US passenger vehicle fuel economy standards affect new vehicle purchases?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069620300553,25 April 2020,2020,Research Article,237.0

Starting in March 2005, this policy greatly reduced exposure to a specific form of pollution—fine particulate matter—in neighboring downwind counties. Using data from the 1995 to 2013 waves of the U.S. Natality Detail Files, we investigate the impact of this reduced exposure on birth outcomes including premature birth, birth weight status and infant mortality. Our most consistent finding is that the CAIR reduced premature birth, particularly among women aged thirty-five and older, those who experienced clinically-designated “risky” pregnancies, and those who gave birth to female newborns. We also find a substantial reduction in infant mortality for newborns whose mothers experienced “risky” pregnancies. Taken together, our findings suggest that policy-induced reductions in exposure to fine particulate matter may lead to improved birth outcomes among those mothers and newborns most at risk.","Though mainly descriptive, mounting evidence suggests that exposure to air pollution may systematically harm infant health, even in developed countries like the United States. More recent evidence implies that a specific form of air pollution—fine particulate air pollution—may also have deleterious impacts on newborn health. “Fine particles” are formed by sulphur dioxide (SO====) and oxides of nitrogen (NO====) emitted primarily from coal fired power plants and, until recently, this form of pollution was largely unregulated. In addition to these power plants producing harmful emissions locally, such emissions may travel reasonably long distances due to prevailing downwind air patterns. As a result, individuals outside of their immediate vicinity may be harmed by fine particulate emissions from coal fired power plants.====In 2005, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) implemented the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) in order to limit emissions from power plants in the eastern United States that were found to interfere with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) of other states. In essence, the CAIR sought to reduce exposure to fine particulate matter in states neighboring other states with coal fired power plants. We examine the potential impacts of the CAIR on infant health outcomes, including premature birth, birth weight status, and infant mortality. Since reductions of fine particulate matter were particularly large in areas deemed “non-attainment” by the EPA, our empirical strategy allows the impact of the CAIR to vary by this designation; in effect, pregnant women and their children in non-attainment areas form our treatment group since they experience the largest drop in exposure to fine particulate matter, while those in “attainment” areas, which had very little exposure to fine particulate matter prior to the CAIR effectively serve as controls.====We use data from the United States Linked Birth and Infant Death Records for the period 1995–2013, inclusive. These data are very rich in terms of birth outcomes, and allow us to identify county of residence so that attainment vs. non-attainment area status, as described briefly above, can be determined. We implement a difference-in-differences strategy where the impact of the CAIR varies across these two statuses. Since prior research suggests that certain groups may be relatively more susceptible to the impacts of air pollution, we allow the overall impact of the CAIR to vary across child gender, a variable that indicates that mother’s age is at least 35 years old, and a variable that indicates a “high-risk” pregnancy status. Our most consistent finding is that the CAIR reduced premature birth, particularly among women aged thirty-five and older, those who experienced clinically-designated “risky” pregnancies, and those who gave birth to female newborns. In addition, we find that newborns categorized as being in “high-risk” pregnancies (i.e., those whose mothers have conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, or eclampsia) experience a reduction in infant mortality. These particular estimates translate into roughly 70 fewer cases per year of infant mortality among children whose mothers experience “high-risk” pregnancy.====While we believe we are first to examine these potential impacts of the CAIR, two other recent papers make important contributions in this area. In particular, Yang et al. (2017) and Yang and Chou (2018) examine the impact of the shutdown of a large polluting power plant on the health outcomes of infants in downwind counties. These studies examine the shutdown of a single large power plant during the time of the CAIR. While greater in magnitude than ours, the results from their work may not be as generalizable, since they investigate one of the worst polluting power plants, and also examine the before and after effect of a complete plant shutdown which is a rare occurrence. One of our paper’s contributions is that it examines the totality of eastern counties affected by the emissions reductions associated with the CAIR. Although the implied magnitudes are much larger in Yang and Chou (2018), qualitatively we find similar results; improvement in preterm births is greater than the improvement in birth weight and the estimate effect is greater for newborn girls.====The next section provides relevant background and is separated into two parts: the first explains the specifics of the CAIR policy, focusing on the period over which it was binding, while the second part focuses on relevant existing studies which assess the potential relationship between air pollution and infant health. While there are strong clinical reasons to expect a relationship between the two, relatively little systematic evidence exists, especially for fine particulate matter whose level, until relatively recently, was largely unregulated. Section 3 describes our data, while Section 4 presents our estimation strategy which exploits existing EPA area designations related to fine particulate pollution exposure.

Neonicotinoid insecticides are the most used class of insecticides in the world, but they are controversial because of their high toxicity to honeybees. In the United States, maize production accounts for the majority of neonicotinoid use, mostly as seed treatments. We find that neonicotinoids substituted for other major insecticides: plots planted with neonicotinoid-treated seeds were 52% and 47% less likely to be treated with pyrethroid and organophosphate insecticides, respectively. Although honeybees have been put at greater risk by neonicotinoids, the changed pattern of pest control instruments has reduced toxicity risk for mammals, birds, and fish. We also find that adoption of genetically engineered insect-resistant maize varieties significantly reduced the use of organophosphate and pyrethroid insecticides, thereby reducing toxicity exposure to all examined taxa. Policies aimed at restricting neonicotinoid use may need to account for undesirable unintended consequences.","Neonicotinoid insecticides have emerged as an integral part of agricultural production. Since their commercial introduction in 1991, they have become the most used class of insecticides in the world, totaling more than $3 billion in sales in 2012 (Jeschke et al., 2011; Bass et al., 2015). In the United States, where most applications take the form of seed treatments, neonicotinoids are now applied on more than 50% of soybean acres (Hurley and Mitchell, 2017) and more than 90% of maize acres, with maize alone accounting for over 60% of neonicotinoid use in U.S. agriculture (USGS , 2018). Despite their commercial success, neonicotinoids have come under intense scrutiny for their possible link to declining honeybee (====) populations. This hypothesis emerged subsequent to the development of Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), a phenomenon first described in 2006–07 when abnormally high bee losses were reported (Henry et al., 2012). In response to mounting evidence of neonicotinoids’ potential role in CCD, the European Union (EU) banned neonicotinoids in 2013 (Stokstad, 2013), and in the United States there have been recent calls to restrict their use (Goulson, 2018).====The policy questions raised by neonicotinoids are not new in the context of pesticides (Feder and Regev, 1975; Zilberman et al., 1991; Hubbell et al., 2000). Chemical inputs such as insecticides and herbicides are essential to modern commercial agriculture, and have been credited with contributing substantially to agricultural productivity increases in both developed and developing countries. Despite these benefits, pesticides remain controversial because of their potentially adverse health and environmental effects (Wilson and Tisdell, 2001; Lai, 2017). Most countries have developed elaborate regulations to address these external effects, which include risk assessments prior to approval (registration), and monitoring with ex post command and control mechanisms such as use restrictions and bans (deregistration) (Zilberman and Millock, 1997; Sexton et al., 2007). The pervasive market failures involved suggest that existing outcomes represent second-best solutions, with the real possibility of unintended effects. A major issue has to do with substitutability between insect control options. A specific product ban may limit a specific risk, ceteris paribus, but other risks may materialize as farmers choose alternative pest control strategies. Indeed, the risk-only approach that underpins the U.S. regulatory framework makes it difficult to account for substitutability and general equilibrium effects (Osteen and Fernandez-Cornejo, 2013). In the context of neonicotinoids, if a ban were implemented in the United States, farmers would likely turn to other currently available insect control options. From a risk perspective, therefore, the policy-relevant question is whether the post-ban situation would result in insecticide usage patterns that are better for the environment and/or human health.====In this paper, we provide novel empirical evidence on several key impacts associated with the widespread adoption of neonicotinoid seed treatments (NeoST) in U.S. maize. The main goals of this analysis are to identify the degree of substitution between NeoSTs and conventional insecticides, to determine what these substitution patterns imply in terms of environmental impact, and to predict farmer adjustments in response to a hypothetical neonicotinoid ban in U.S. maize. Concomitantly, we also aim to identify and disentangle the separate insecticide use impacts of NeoSTs from those attributable to the adoption of genetically engineered (GE) varieties that embed traits based on ==== (Bt) genes.====Economic analysis has shown that farmers ultimately care about the impact of pest damage on production. Existing economic models emphasize the damage-control input nature of pesticides (Lichtenberg and Zilberman, 1986; Oude Lansink and Carpentier, 2001; Wechsler and Smith, 2018), with farmers choosing preventative and/or responsive pesticide applications to maximize expected profits, subject to the constraints imposed by available options. Over the past two decades, there have been radical changes in the set of available insect control options. GE insect-resistant varieties were introduced in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and NeoST maize was introduced in 2004. Most farmers now use these newer options for insect control, relying less on conventional insecticides. In 2010, for example, just over 10% of maize area was treated with conventional insecticides, a more than 75% decrease from its peak at 45% in the mid-1980s (Osteen and Fernandez-Cornejo, 2013; Coupe and Capel, 2016).====Neonicotinoids can persist in the environment, accumulate in soils, leach into waterways, and they pose a threat to a number of other non-target species, especially pollinators and soil and aquatic invertebrates (Goulson, 2013). But the main available alternative pest control options—organophosphate and pyrethroid insecticides (Furlan and Kreutzweiser 2015)—have limitations of their own. Organophosphates are widely considered more dangerous for applicators and mammals than neonicotinoids (Hurley and Mitchell, 2017), and pyrethroids are highly toxic to aquatic life and often as toxic to non-target insects (Douglas and Tooker, 2016). Empirical evidence of substitution into these insecticides has recently been documented in the EU, where it has been found that the EU neonicotinoid ban has led to increases in the use of alternative soil and foliar applied insecticides in both maize (Kathage et al., 2018) and oilseed rape production (Kathage et al., 2018; Scott and Bilsborrow, 2019; Dewar, 2017).====The availability of detailed data has been a limiting factor to existing research on the impacts of actual neonicotinoid use in U.S. agriculture (Douglas and Tooker, 2015). The Pesticide National Synthesis Project maintained by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) provides the most comprehensive source of pesticide use data in the United States, including NeoSTs (Thelin and Stone, 2013). However, these data are only available at an aggregated (regional or national) level. Thus, while they can be used to construct some of the environmental impact metrics that we report below, they cannot be used to reliably characterize the impact of NeoSTs on the use of alternative insecticides, nor their impact on toxicity exposure to various species. For this purpose, farm-level data on a large scale is essential.====To address these shortcomings, this study uses data on insecticide applications from more than 89,000 U.S. farm-level surveys, encompassing 182,307 distinct sets of pesticide-related choices during the 1998–2014 period. The thrust of our analysis consists of estimating the impact of NeoST adoption on two different measures of insecticide use intensity. Importantly, all estimated models include control variables for the separate effects due to the introduction and diffusion of GE insect-resistant varieties that embed Bt traits.====Using linear probability models, we first estimate the impact of NeoST adoption on the likelihood of using each of five major insecticide subgroups: organophosphates, pyrethroids, carbamates, phenylpyrazoles, and category I insecticides.==== We find that NeoST maize adopters are 52% less likely to use a pyrethroid, 47% less likely to use an organophosphate, and 46% less likely to use a category I insecticide. These impacts are robust to the inclusion of Bt trait controls, which are themselves found to reduce insecticide use (albeit to a lesser degree than NeoSTs).====Although the results from the linear probability models are informative about the substitution effects brought about by NeoST adoption, they do not reveal the direction or magnitude of their net environmental impact. This is due to the fact that individual insecticides have widely different environmental impacts which depend, ====, on the species-specific toxicity of the active ingredient and its application rate. To address this pesticide-heterogeneity issue, we adopt a procedure consistent with risk assessment methods used by the EPA and several previous related studies (EPA, undated; Nelson and Bullock, 2003; Nowell et al., 2014; Kniss, 2017). Specifically, for each observed insecticide application we compute a ====: the ratio of the insecticide’s observed application rate to its toxicity rating. For each plot (our unit of observation), we then compute a ====: the sum of risk quotients for all applied insecticides on that plot, including the risk quotient for a NeoST (if adopted). Using these plot-specific hazard quotients as the dependent variable of interest, we then estimate NeoST impact regressions for four different species groups: mammals, birds, fish, and honeybees. In short, we do find that plots planted with NeoST maize pose higher toxicity risk for bees on average, as expected, but we also find robust evidence that such plots pose significantly lower toxicity risk for mammals and fish.====The strength of this paper lies in its empirical contribution to the literature, which is predicated on a large and representative sample of actual farmers’ choices. As with any observation-based empirical study, however, in estimating the impacts of NeoST adoption on insecticide use we face the issue of selection bias and unobserved confounders. In our setting, we must address the fact that farmers choose whether or not to adopt NeoST maize. To the extent that some farmers adopt NeoST maize for unobserved reasons related to their other insect control choices, then the estimated treatment effects may be biased. To control for unobserved confounders, we include farmer fixed effects, which eliminate bias that would result from unobserved confounding time-invariant farm-level factors such as education, risk aversion, and average farm-specific differences in insect pressure. We also include year fixed effects, which control for factors such as output prices, insecticide prices, and nationwide year-to-year variation in insect pressure and insect resistance. Perhaps the most important remaining potential unobserved confounder is expected pest pressure that varies over time and space. We note, however, that farmers who encounter high pest pressure will be more likely to use ==== of insect control. The estimated NeoST impact coefficient will soak up some of this effect and, therefore, be biased towards indicating complementarity, rather than substitutability, with insecticide use. We thus view our results as conservative estimates of the degree to which NeoSTs substitute for insecticides.====The analysis and findings presented here make several important contributions to the extant literature. With the exception of the limited case-study-based findings following the EU neonicotinoid ban (Kathage et al., 2018; Scott and Bilsborrow, 2019; Dewar, 2017), there are no large scale empirical studies that document and estimate the impacts of widespread neonicotinoid use. In addition, there is no existing work that uses farm-level data to estimate and disentangle the impacts of ==== NeoST and GE trait adoption on the likelihood of using specific insecticide groups, nor do any previous studies estimate their impacts on toxicity risk for different species. Whereas we find a significant role for GE traits, a result consistent with previous studies that do not control for neonicotinoids (Perry et al., 2016; Klümper and Qaim, 2014), our findings suggest that NeoST adoption has been ==== instrumental than Bt trait adoption in contributing to the large observed reduction in conventional insecticide use. Perhaps most importantly, our results contribute important information to the intensifying policy debate on neonicotinoid restrictions in the United States. A major implication of our findings is that policymakers should be aware of the potential for undesirable unintended consequences from neonicotinoid restrictions, particularly the potential for substitution into some of the more hazardous insecticide compounds such as organophosphates and category I insecticides.",Neonicotinoids in U.S. maize: Insecticide substitution effects and environmental risk,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069620300437,8 April 2020,2020,Research Article,239.0

Educating consumers about the costs of their individual energy consuming actions is complicated by the fact that residential customers often face a nonlinear price schedule, where the total amount consumed up to any point in the billing cycle determines the marginal price the customer pays for an additional unit of consumption.====A utility rolling out a program to improve energy cognizance would aim for its customers to respond in a way that is both consistent with the goals of the utility and of a magnitude that makes the program worthwhile. For example, households may increase or decrease their consumption after improving their energy cognizance, and this may be a temporary or more permanent response. Observing ==== consumption response is important to the utility if it reflects an increase in the customer's ability to respond to price changes, because this could improve the effectiveness of subsequent changes in the utility's tariff policy.==== This paper uses results from a field experiment in Puebla, Mexico, to evaluate the consumption responses to an intervention designed to improve energy cognizance. The intervention was a 20-minute workshop tailored to the household's typical monthly consumption that explains how usage of different electrical appliances owned by that household translates into marginal changes in the household's electricity bill given its typical position on the nonlinear tariff.====We find that in aggregate, households taking our intervention subsequently used less electricity. This result was driven by a subset of households that were heavy users before the intervention and consequently faced the highest marginal prices for electricity under the non-linear tariff structure in Puebla. These high-consuming households that randomly received the offer to take our workshop reduced energy use, on average, by nearly 3%. We estimate an average reduction in energy use of more than 6% for the high-consuming households that actually accepted our offer and took the workshop. The impact of our intervention was durable with the reductions in electricity use among the treatment group observed one year after the intervention, which was the end of our sample period.====Our study demonstrates that programs designed to improve the energy cognizance of customers can be a useful policy tool for utilities. Such educational interventions can offer a different response duration, magnitude, and mechanism relative to the more commonly studied utility interventions involving peer comparisons of consumption and normative appeals to conserve energy. Peer comparisons or normative appeals can be faster and easier messages to convey than developing energy cognizance. Ferraro and Price (2013) conclude from their study of non-pecuniary messages in a residential water experiment that “conservation strategies based on social comparisons or appeals to social norms …are best reserved for situations where immediate but short-lived conservation efforts are desired.” Our intervention on the other hand might provide a more persistent consumption impact but perhaps is less suitable when instant conservation efforts are required.====We demonstrate that the scale of the consumption response in this study was large enough to make the program cost-effective, if the goal of the program was to conserve energy. We also present descriptive evidence consistent with improved energy cognizance being the mechanism behind these consumption responses. First, we find that younger households and those with less formal education had larger changes in their consumption following the intervention when compared to other households. Further, although not precisely estimated, households facing the lowest marginal price on the nonlinear tariff schedule on average increased their consumption, in contrast to the large consumption reductions observed among those facing higher marginal prices. These observations, for an intervention design that focused on information provision without normative appeals or peer-group comparisons, are consistent with less informed customers decreasing their consumption after discovering that the marginal cost for some of their electricity-consuming actions was higher than they previously thought. These results are also consistent with less informed consumers increasing their consumption upon discovering the marginal cost of their electricity-consuming actions was lower than they thought.====Three key elements characterize our field experiment and form the basis of comparison with existing studies of information provision in utility settings: 1) our intervention provides quantitative information through a personalized workshop on how a customer's bill changes in response to changes in their use of major electricity-consuming appliances relative to their typical monthly consumption level, 2) it is free of any normative or peer-comparison appeals, and 3) it is conducted in an emerging economy setting. Prior research has contained subsets of these characteristics, but we consider this study the first that has contained all three elements.====The primary aim of our intervention was to create more informed electricity consumers by providing the personalized energy workshop. Similar information to what we provide is included in some studies that also contain goal setting, normative appeals or peer comparisons, making it difficult to separately identify whether such information provision is useful.==== The content in our intervention addresses the concern first expressed in Shin (1985) that residential customers are broadly unaware of the nonlinear price schedules they face (more recent studies in both electricity and water settings include Borenstein, 2009; Wichman, 2014; Ito, 2014; McRae and Meeks, 2016; Brent and Ward, 2019). We attempt to increase the sophistication of households by explaining how their bill is computed for the nonlinear price schedule they face and then demonstrating how changes in the use of different electricity-consuming appliances they own would change their electricity bill at their typical level of monthly consumption. This personalized educational invention differs from other approaches to improving the salience of electricity usage and consequent expenditures through varying the format of the bill (Wilhite and Ling, 1995), the frequency/time since last bill (Wilhite and Ling, 1995; Gilbert and Graff Zivin, 2014; Wichman, 2017) or transitioning to an electronic delivery method (Sexton, 2015). Each of these other approaches has been shown to impact consumption levels.====Our intervention is most closely related to Kahn and Wolak (2013), who administered a similar randomized controlled trial that targeted residential electricity customers in California. Their web-based intervention shows customers historical information about their marginal price – the highest price on the increasing block price schedule with positive consumption during the billing cycle – and the potential changes in their monthly electricity bill associated with changes in use of different electricity-consuming appliances.==== Kahn and Wolak (2013) found that those customers facing the lowest marginal price increased their consumption slightly, while those facing higher marginal prices decreased use, with larger absolute decreases associated with higher marginal prices.====However, our study necessarily departs from Kahn and Wolak (2013) – and many prior studies that incentivize more informed energy consumption – by tailoring the workshop for households in an emerging economy setting, where energy use for larger segments of the population might be closer to subsistence levels, and where web-based delivery of information is less feasible.==== Instead, our workshops were conducted in person, on the doorsteps of residences. Of the households in which we found someone at home, 60% chose to participate in the research and receive the information-based treatment, far exceeding response rates seen in similar information provision studies undertaken in more industrialized country settings. These high take-up rates, along with low labor costs to implement the treatment (relative to the bill savings from the observed electricity use reductions), can make education interventions in emerging economies cost-effective despite the need to deliver the information in person.====The findings and design of this intervention may be of particular relevance to utility policy makers in developing countries. The first reason relates to the information content; education may be a more appropriate policy goal than strict conservation, empowering households to make informed and financially self-interested decisions about how to increase or curtail their use of electricity-consuming appliances.====Second, our study design and in-person delivery method is more implementable in developing country settings. Finding methods to engage effectively with customers in these settings can be challenging as they generally lack modern infrastructure for efficient load management or technologies such as “smart meters” that can allow utilities to send real-time price signals and consumption feedback to customers.==== Therefore, promising real-time information provision tools such as those examined in Connecticut (Jessoe and Rapson, 2014) and Singapore (Wolak, 2015) are not yet applicable to virtually all developing country environments.====Finally, electricity services in most developing countries have been provided by a monopoly state-run utility for generations, potentially resulting in less engaged and informed customers. In contrast, utilities in the US have attempted to engage customers by administering a wide variety of energy efficiency programs since the 1970s (Gillingham et al., 2006), whereas such programs have only recently become more common in low- and middle-income countries (Davis et al., 2014). As a result, the baseline level of engagement with a utility or knowledge about electricity in a typical household might be different in developing countries, and the lessons from studies aiming for more informed energy consumption in industrialized settings might be less relevant.==== Although the questions we tackle and the applicability of our intervention are not unique to low- and middle-income countries, the ability to implement and scale consumer education programs in settings with low labor costs and low Internet penetration rates might provide certain advantages and greater impacts that could not be replicated in more industrialized settings. Rather than struggling to replicate the kinds of energy education and conservation programs used by the highest income countries, Mexico and other emerging economies could leverage their own cost and cultural advantages to overcome problems with consumer education and engagement.====The remainder of the paper proceeds to explain the electricity billing system in Puebla, Mexico, before describing the details of our randomized controlled trial and the specific information conveyed to customers through our intervention. A description of the empirical results follows, along with a discussion of several caveats associated with these results and then a comparison to previous research. We provide an estimate of the cost-effectiveness of our intervention both in absolute terms and relative to previous energy conservation campaigns in Mexico.

Past research has found significant, robust impacts of hotter temperatures on reducing economic growth. While rainfall is important for agriculture, impacts on aggregate economic activity remain elusive. In this paper, I argue that rainfall is a poor indicator of water availability, particularly in urban contexts. Instead, I find that changes in water runoff significantly impact economic growth. Results show that years in which runoff is significantly lower than average, local economic activity growth is depressed. This impact is strongest in middle-income regions, where runoff 1 or 2 ==== below normal levels reduces GDP growth by 0.4–0.6% and 1.3–2.5%. I examine two mechanisms, agricultural production and hydropower dependence. Globally, agricultural production is depressed by below average runoff shocks, although the resulting impact on GDP is likely low. Regions which are more urban and rely more on hydropower production in their energy mix are significantly more sensitive to these runoff shocks. With climate change expected to increase the variability of water runoff, these shocks are expected to become more frequent in the future and in some regions may significantly hamper growth.","The importance of water in society is all-encompassing. It is a necessary input in nearly all economic sectors, including and especially agriculture, power generation, and manufacturing. By 2030, water withdrawals are expected to increase by 50 percent for agricultural uses, and nearly 100 percent for industry, over 2010 levels (2030 , 2009Water Resources Group). Meeting this growing water demand will pose a major challenge, particularly for regions which are already water stressed. Further compounding this challenge is the expected increase in water variability due to climate change, which will make water supplies less predictable and more volatile.====In this paper, I explore the importance of changes to water resource endowments for economic growth. To do so, I utilize several global datasets with high spatial resolution, to measure local impacts. Local economic activity is measured using satellite imagery of night-time lights (NTLs). Water supply is measured using a dataset on predicted water runoff. This measure indicates the natural amount of water runoff available to a local area without accounting for upstream withdrawals, which would lead to endogeneity concerns. Using these datasets, I study how large deviations in local water runoff, termed “runoff shocks”, impact the growth of economic activity. While the impact of positive runoff shocks—years which experience relative increases in runoff levels—is ambiguous, negative runoff shocks—years which experience relative decreases in runoff levels—shows consistent and robust negative effects on economic growth. In addition to showing global results using NTL, I also test this relationship using municipal GDP data from Brazil and Colombia and find corroborating results.====There is a large and growing empirical literature on the economic impacts of weather and climate change (Dell et al., 2014 provide a review). Much of this literature has found that while changes in temperature can have robust impacts on economic growth—with hotter temperatures suppressing growth—evidence on the impacts of water availability, typically measured by annual precipitation, have been less clear (Dell et al., 2012,2014; Burke et al., 2015; Carleton and Hsiang, 2016; Colacito et al., 2019). Moreover, studies that do find impacts of precipitation tend to focus only on agricultural impacts (Mendelsohn Nordhaus and Shaw, 1994; Auffhammer et al., 2006; Auffhammer and Schlenker, 2014; Fishman, 2016),==== whereas water availability can impact economic growth through various other channels, including: linkages between the agricultural sector and other sectors such as agribusiness; energy production, particularly hydropower, but also other thermal energy production where water is used for cooling; reducing firm performance in water intensive sectors; general equilibrium impacts caused by rising food prices and reductions in agricultural labor income; health and disease impacts from flooding and droughts; and changes in time allocation when individuals need to spend more time and effort collecting clean water.====Given the dual trends of increasing water demand due to population growth and increasing wealth, and increasing water variability due to climate change, quantifying the cost of water supply shocks becomes critical. In the face of scarce resources, policy-makers require information on the cost of water supply shocks and water scarcity to determine efficient levels of investment in mitigation and adaptation infrastructure and policies. Up until now, the literature has failed to find a robust, causal link between water supply shocks and economic growth, making the case for investments such as these difficult. One of the likely reasons for this failure is that the literature has focused on rainfall as a measure of water availability. While water availability is certainly impacted by local rainfall, rainfall is also fleeting and tends to flow downhill. Some of that water will remain in the soil column, where it can be absorbed and transpirated by crops and plants, thus benefiting agricultural production. However, much of it will also ‘runoff’ the land, collect in streams and rivers, and can be transported hundreds of kilometers, eventually flowing into lakes, reservoirs, or the sea. By only measuring rainfall, past research does not account for a significant share of what ultimately becomes the available water supply. Water runoff—the sum of total discharges from precipitation, snow melt, or irrigation water that appears in surface streams, rivers, drains, or sewers====—better indicates total available water for economic activities. Indeed, many productive activities do not directly rely on rainfall, but instead depend on runoff that is collected in rivers and reservoirs, for instance irrigated agriculture, power generation (both hydropower generation and for thermal cooling), and industrial and other municipal water supplies.====In this article, I fill this gap in the literature and examine the link between shocks to the available water supply, as measured by water runoff, and economic activity. I employ an empirical strategy most similar to that of Dell et al. (2012) (henceforth, DJO), which uses a panel dataset to examine how fluctuations in weather, year over year, are related to economic growth. However, I make three significant changes to the DJO methodology which are important to identifying the impacts of water availability on economic growth.====First, I use spatially disaggregated data on both runoff and economic activity. DJO rely on country-year observations of GDP and weather. This aggregation can greatly mask underlying heterogeneity, which may impact precipitation measures more than temperature, given rainfall’s local nature. I therefore employ gridded data, with gridcells 0.5°==== in size (approximately 55  km==== at the equator). Uniform, gridded data will better identify local impacts of water availability, which are smoothed out in cross-country regressions where one part of a country could be undergoing a drought, while other parts are experiencing above average water endowments.====Changes in economic activity are measured by annual changes in NTLs. The use of NTLs as a proxy for economic activity, and particularly gross domestic product, has become very widely used in recent years. The link between NTL and economic activity is predicated on the fact that light is needed for the consumption of nearly all goods and services at night. Thus, as household consumption increases, one would expect a similar increase in lighting. This relationship is not entirely straightforward, given that the actual relationship between economic activity and NTL will depend on many factors, including public versus private light and the fraction of consumption occurring at night. Nevertheless, there is ample evidence of a robust and quantifiable relationship between these measures. In section 2, I provide a brief review of the literature that provides evidence for the link between economic activity and NTLs, as well as recent economic literature that employs NTLs as a proxy for economic activity.====The second major change is that I use runoff as a proxy for water availability, instead of precipitation. As noted above, most economic studies which measure the impact of water endowments focus on precipitation as their measure for water availability. This may be reasonable when focusing on agricultural outcomes, particularly in developing countries where much of agriculture is rainfed. However, as a measure of total availability, including water for irrigation, human consumption, and water used by cities, as well as for the detection of floods, water runoff may be a more complete measure. To show runoff’s better predictive power than precipitation, in section 5.4 I include various measures of precipitation in the same regression as runoff, thus allowing them to compete statistically.====Depending on the runoff model used, there may be concerns about endogeneity between runoff and economic activity. In addition to being impacted by weather, runoff in a particular location is also a function of both upstream land use and water withdrawals. Thus, as economic activity upstream changes, so will runoff downstream. The runoff dataset used in this study was chosen specifically to avoid such concerns. It does not factor in upstream withdrawals, and is based instead on water distribution determined from a hydrological model and a climate model. In addition, while it factors in land use, it uses a static measure which will therefore not be impacted by changes in economic activity (for more information see section 3.1).==== However, these inaccuracies are mitigated by the use of gridcell fixed effects and country time trends, which should account for local inaccuracies that are either time invariant (e.g. a region where runoff is always inaccurate by the same amount each year, perhaps due to positive, but unchanging upstream water withdrawals), as well as inaccuracies that are growing overtime (e.g. a region where upstream water withdrawals are increasing linearly over time). In addition, modeling runoff in the form of shock indicators will also minimize the impact of these inaccuracies. A water supply shock is highly likely to translate to a water balance shock (water supply – water demand), and thus the former is a good indicator of the latter.====Finally, rather than only examining levels of runoff, which forces the relationship between runoff and economic growth to be both linear and symmetric around zero, I examine the impacts of runoff ‘shocks’, which are calculated using z-scores. Using the long-run annual mean and standard deviation of runoff in each gridcell, I identify gridcells which experience unusually high or low levels of runoff. I define a moderate shock in a gridcell as annual runoff which is between 1 and 2 standard deviations away from the long-run mean of that gridcell. Similarly, a large shock is defined as runoff being at least 2 standard deviation away from the long run mean. By using dummy variables which indicate these four types of shocks (moderate and large negative shocks, and moderate and large positive shocks), I can flexibly estimate the impact of runoff variability in a semi-parametric manner, which allows for non-linear impacts. I also test for alternative specifications including log runoff, continuous z-scores, and 0.5sd bins.====I find that negative runoff shocks have a significant impact on economic growth. Globally, moderate negative runoff shocks reduce the growth rate of luminosity by 1.4 percent, and large negative runoff shocks reduce it by 4 percent. These impacts are largest in middle-income regions (i.e. 25th to 75th percentile of luminosity per capita) and increase with population density. Positive runoff shocks do not show a consistent or robust impact on the growth rate of luminosity, perhaps because they conflate the beneficial impact of additional water, and the harmful impact of potential floods. The results are corroborated by using data on municipal GDP per capita in Brazil and Colombia, where impacts are found to be largely similar.====I test for several heterogeneities and mechanisms in the results. First, I find that impacts are largest in middle-income regions-i.e. regions in middle income countries, as well as regions in the middle two quartiles of income per capita (as measured by luminosity per capita). Impacts also scale with levels of urbanization. These results imply that it is developing country cities that are most at risk from water supply shocks. By using a global measure of vegetation and cropland, I find that runoff shocks do have a modest impact on agricultural productivity, though likely not large enough to explain a considerable share of impacts on aggregate GDP. I also use data from China and India to show that hydropower dependent regions are most sensitive to runoff shocks, thus offering a potential transmission link from reduced hydropower production to slower growth.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2 describe the rationale for using water runoff as an indicator of water availability, and review the literature linking NTLs and economic activity and growth. In section 3, I describe the datasets used in this analysis. In section 4, I present my empirical strategy. Section 5 presents the main results using NTL, municipal GDP results from Brazil and Colombia, an analysis of heterogeneity of impacts and potential mechanisms, and robustness checks. Finally, I present a discussion of the results and brief conclusion in section 6.",Water runoff and economic activity: The impact of water supply shocks on growth,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069620300450,5 April 2020,2020,Research Article,241.0

A theoretical analysis indicates that higher tariffs have ambiguous effects on invasive pest introductions. An ==== using data from US Department of Agriculture surveillance screening indicates that tariff rates exert a negligible influence on expected invasive pest introductions from commodities currently facing positive tariffs. Removal of duty free status would decrease expected pest intercepts but undermine other goals of US ,"Trade always carries with it the risk that invasive alien species (IAS) present in commodities themselves, in packing materials, or in transport equipment could be introduced into domestic environments. Once arrived, some of those organisms can establish themselves and some that establish themselves will go on to cause significant ecological and economic damage. The global rate of newly recorded IAS averaged just over 70 per decade prior to the start of the 19th century and escalated to 4751 new records during 1991–2000 (Seebens et al., 2017). A primary factor in the growth of IAS introductions is the expansion of world trade (Office of Technology Assessment, 1993; National Research Council, 2002; Paini et al., 2016). Both the volume of IAS arrivals and the diversity of the organisms that arrive have increased with growth in the variety and volume of traded commodities and the number of trading partners.====The spread of IAS through trade depends on two primary factors: (1) the joint production of goods and their infestation levels in exporting countries, and (2) preventive measures implemented in importing countries under authority of the Phytosanitary Agreement of the World Trade Organization. Screening of import shipments is one of the main methods countries use to prevent introductions of harmful organisms. For example, all plant materials entering the US (including fruits, vegetables, cut flowers, bulbs, seeds, cuttings, other plant imports and packing materials) are subject to inspection for potential pests. Shipments in which certain organisms are detected are allowed to enter the US only after treatment by fumigation, exposure to cold, or similar methods. Shipments in which certain other pests are detected are not allowed to enter the US under any circumstances and must thus be re-exported or destroyed. In either case, the detection of potential IAS imposes a cost on exporting producers.====The economics literature suggests that tariffs may be a more powerful instrument for preventing invasive pest introductions than inspections, the idea being that a commodity tariff adjusted for expected damage from pest introductions acts as a Pigouvian tax that deters introductions by reducing both import volume and infestation levels (Costello and McAusland, 2003; McAusland and Costello, 2004). This literature shows that it is always optimal for an importing country to impose such Pigouvian tariffs but that there exist situations in which inspections are not optimal; in other words, there exist conditions under which tariffs should be the only policy instrument used to prevent IAS introductions (McAusland and Costello, 2004). An empirical study by Knowler and Barbier (2005) illustrates the use of such Pigouvian tariffs for a potentially invasive nursery plant while Prestemon et al. (2006) study the effects of lower forest product tariffs on the risk of invasion by forest pests. Inspired by issues raised by forest product imports, a theoretical analysis by Tu et al. (2008) examines how a Pigouvian tariff might affect the composition of exports between raw and processed products.====This paper provides a comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis of the potential effectiveness of tariffs as a means of reducing IAS arrivals at the micro level. We focus on the decisions of exporting producers over the export quantity and pest infestation of individual shipments and how the resulting arrival rate of IAS responds to tariffs and inspections imposed by the importing country. We use micro-level data to estimate these effects. For a subset of commodities we are able to estimate the corresponding consumer welfare loss associated with changes in tariffs and duty free status. Together, our empirical estimates and our focus on micro-level outcomes contrasts with the studies cited above, which emphasize responses at the country level.====We begin with a theoretical examination of the risk of invasive pest introductions. Tariffs and sanitary/phytosanitary (SPS) regulations are assumed to be country and commodity specific but independent of the idiosyncratic characteristics of an individual shipment. The number of exporting producers is large so the commodity-country-specific tariff is exogenous for each producer. We derive an individual exporter’s optimal choice of shipment volume and IAS infestation level conditional on tariffs and inspection intensity in the importing country. We then derive the importing country’s optimal inspection strategy for an individual shipment with a given value and tariff rate and analyze the characteristics of the resulting Nash equilibrium.====We use our theoretical framework to specify an econometric model of the effects of tariffs, duty free status, and commodity value and shipment volume on the risk of invasive pest arrivals in U.S. imports of fruits and vegetables. Data from surveillance screening conducted by the Animal and Plant Health Service of the US Department of Agriculture (APHIS) are used to estimate how the probability that at least one invasive pest is detected in a shipment depends on tariff rates, unit commodity value, and duty free status, controlling for commodity type, country of origin, production season, transport pathway, and port of entry into the US. The model is used to estimate the effects of raising tariff rates or rescinding duty free status on the probability of invasive pest detection in shipments of commodities differentiated by type and region of origin. The APHIS data also enable us to estimate how the number of shipments of each commodity from each country responds to variations in the tariff rate, commodity value, and duty free status, with controls for commodity type, country of origin, transport pathway, production season, and port of entry into the US. The empirical results are combined to produce an estimate of how the expected number of interceptions per year responds to tariffs and duty free status for all commodity/country import combinations.====Our results imply that Pigouvian tariffs are likely not an attractive means of preventing IAS introductions at the margin. We find that raising tariff rates on commodities facing a positive tariff induces small reductions in the probability of detecting an IAS and on the expected number of annual IAS arrivals. Removing duty free status reduces the probability of detecting an IAS in a shipment and leads to reductions in the expected number of IAS arrivals, primarily by decreasing the annual number of shipments. That combination would significantly reduce the number of expected IAS intercepts but would likely disrupt US trade policy and cause substantial US consumer welfare losses. We estimate trade elasticities for a subset of commodities and find that, for these commodities, loss of duty free status causes an expected welfare loss of $38.2 million per expected detection avoided.",Tariffs and the risk of invasive pest introductions in commodity imports: Theory and empirical evidence,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069620300449,2 April 2020,2020,Research Article,242.0

Using unique plant-level data for U.S. ==== from 1990 to 2007, we find evidence that, in response to increasingly stringent environmental regulations at the county level, multi-plant firms do exercise their greater flexibility in adjusting production, relative to single-plant firms. Specifically, in regulated counties, the likelihood of a plant shutting down is higher for multi-plant firms. Moreover, we measure the firm internal network effect at the local, neighborhood, and the wider-area levels, as defined by the number of affiliated plants clustered in different regional levels. Their effects on plant closure decisions for dirty subsidiaries vary with the network level. We further decompose the neighborhood network into those in regulated and unregulated neighborhood counties, and examine how these network metrics are associated with closure decisions of dirty plants affiliated with multi-plant firms. The presence of more sibling plants residing in neighboring counties that are free from regulatory controls are associated with a higher closure probability of dirty plants in a regulated county.","Environmental regulations have long been of considerable policy interest, and remain controversial. Supporters of regulatory controls point to significant health benefits associated with reductions in environmental pollution, while critics blame environmental regulations for productivity drops, job losses, and relocation of manufacturers. For both sides of the argument, a critical question relates to how firms respond to environmental regulation. Empirical contributions in this area have sought to quantify such response (Henderson, 1996; Becker and Henderson, 2000, 2001; List et al., 2003b; Becker, 2005). However, the existing literature has paid little attention to the role of a firm’s plant structure. Because multi-plant firms may behave differently than single-plant firms, multi-plant firms’ decisions about relocation, in response to regulatory controls, may impact the effectiveness of environmental regulations. They also have the potential to play a major role in the dynamics of employment, evolution of regional economies, and restructuring of industry. This is relevant because multi-plant firms account for a large share of U.S. manufacturing activities—as noted by Bernard and Jensen (2007), they employ 78% of the manufacturing workforce and produce 88% of the output. Within the same polluting industry and residing in the same county with regulatory pressures, multi-plant firms are also more likely to have emission above the critical level that triggers the need for regulatory compliance than single-plant firms (Becker and Henderson, 2000, 2001).====In this article, we follow Bernard and Jensen (2007) by focusing squarely on the probability of plant death, and investigate a channel that was not explored in their analysis. Specifically, we study the impact of environmental regulation on plant death: the extent to which stringent regulation leads “dirty” plants to exit an industry. In the process, the effects on plant closure of plant attributes, local agglomeration, and some county characteristics are investigated as well. We also examine whether multi-plant firms are more or less likely to shut down affiliated plants in response to stringent regulatory controls. Moreover, information on existing plants affiliated with the same headquarters is used to investigate the role of firms’ internal network. We measure internal network effects at three different regional levels: local, neighborhood, and the wider area, and we examine how these internal network effects interact with exposure to environmental regulations. We further decompose the neighborhood network into those in regulated and unregulated neighboring counties, and examine how these network measures affect closure decisions of dirty plants (relative to clean ones) affiliated with multi-plant firms.====The particular empirical focus of this article on the role of multi-plant firms, and their internal structure, is motivated by the theoretical ambiguity of how differently multi-plant firms, relative to single-plant firms, may respond to external pressure affecting profitability (Bernard and Jensen, 2007). In our context, multi-plant firms may exercise their greater flexibility in different ways. The availability of multiple plants may reduce the closure probability of a given plant because the firm may abate pollution by reallocating production activities across plants. Alternatively, a multi-plant firm may use plant shutdown as the margin of adjustment to comply with environmental regulation. The costs of a plant’s closure are lessened by the ability to shift production activities (and associated jobs) from plants in regulated areas to plants in unregulated areas. The consequences of plant closure are clearly less draconian for multi-plant firms—closure does not imply the end of the firm. The options available to single-plant firms in regulated areas, on the other hand, are more limited.====To carry out the empirical analysis outlined in the foregoing, we compile a unique detailed plant-level dataset for the U.S. manufacturing sector from 1990 to 2007. To measure plants’ exposure to environmental compliance costs, we match plant-level data with county nonattainment/attainment designations under the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) legislation of 1990. By exploiting the spatial and time variations of the CAAA, we estimate the heterogeneous responses of multi-plant firms and single-plant firms to county nonattainment designations. In particular, we propose a triple difference-in-difference model with interaction among a dirty industry dummy, a county regulation indicator, and the regional firm internal network that varies with exposure to environmental pressures.====We obtain some novel and interesting results. First, conditional on plant attributes and county characteristics, we find that nonattainment status under the CAAA legislation leads to some exit of dirty plants in regulated areas. Moreover, we find that multi-plant firms are more likely to close plants in regulated counties as compared to single-plant firms. The closure probability is positively correlated with the plant’s distance to the headquarters and the number of existing similar plants affiliated with the same parent company. Second, with respect to firms’ internal network effects, we find that the effects of regulation vary with the network level. At the neighborhood level, the larger the number of affiliated plants located in counties sharing borders with the regulated county, the more likely an affiliated dirty plant in the regulated county is to be closed. Third, when conditioning on the neighbor network effect by its exposure to environmental pressures, we find that the presence of more sibling plants residing in neighboring counties that are free from regulatory controls is associated with a higher closure probability of dirty plants in regulated counties. Such internal network effects in regulated neighboring counties are more pronounced in the post-CAAA period of 1990–1999.====This article contributes to the empirical literature that studies the impact of environmental regulations on firms’ site choices (Jeppesen et al., 2002; Brunnermeier and Levinson, 2004). One line of studies uses region-level data to examine the effects of regulatory controls on plant births. Using county-level data on plant birth from the U.S. Census Bureau during 1963–1992, Henderson (1996) shows that the ground-level ozone nonattainment regulation leads to the relocation of polluting plants from more to less polluted areas. The follow-up study by Becker and Henderson (2000) further distinguishes the county-level plant births by corporate and nonaffiliated sectors. Whereas the former refers to multi-plant firms, the latter indicates single-plant firms. They find a shift in plant births from the more regulated multi-plant firms to the less regulated single-plant firms. List et al., 2003a, List et al., 2003b revisit the conjecture of a negative correlation between environmental regulation and manufacturing plant birth. Using a county-level dataset for the State of New York from 1980 to 1990, their empirical estimates suggest that pollution-intensive plants adversely respond to county nonattainment designations. Using county-level data, List et al. (2004) examine the heterogeneous effects of environmental regulations on plant birth decisions for domestic and foreign plants. They find evidence that domestic plants are responsive to environmental regulations, while foreign plants are not. Also, environmental regulation stringency significantly impacts the site choices of relocating plants (List et al., 2003).====Another line of inquiry employs plant-level data to examine the effects of regulation stringency on plant location choices. Levinson (1996) considers six environmental regulatory measures for single-plant firms and branches of the 500 largest multi-plant manufacturers, and finds little evidence about the negative impacts of stringent state-level environmental regulations on plant births. List and Co (2000) focus on the state-level environmental regulatory effects on foreign multinational corporations’ new plant site choices from 1986 to 1993, and document a negative relationship between environmental stringency and plant birth. Tole and Koop (2010) examine the effects of environmental standards on plant birth decisions of gold mining multinationals across countries.====This article also adds to the literature in empirical industrial organization that examines the role of firm attributes in determining firms’ site choices.==== Using plant-level data from the Censuses of Manufactures from 1987 to 1997, Bernard and Jensen (2007) find that plants affiliated with multi-plant firms or with U.S.-based multinationals have significantly greater chances of being shutdown, controlling for plant attributes.==== Similarly, Kneller et al. (2012), based on Japanese plant-level data, find that plants belonging to multi-plant firms are more vulnerable to closure compared with similar single-plant firms. Moreover, they show that multi-plant multinationals are even more likely to shut down their affiliated plants. By contrast, this article aims to highlight the role of firms’ internal structure in response to stringent environmental controls. As such, our work is also related to recent research examining how firms spread the impacts of local shocks across regions through their internal network of affiliated plants. Local positive investment shocks in Giroud and Mueller (2015) are measured by the introduction of new airline routes between headquarters and affiliated plants, whereas Giroud and Mueller (2017) study local negative employment shocks by exploiting the regional variations in house prices during the Great Recession. In our context, the local shock of interest is the changing stringency of environmental regulation.====The remainder of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly summarizes the CAAA environmental regulation, and further expands on how regulation-induced cost shocks may affect plant closure. Section 3 presents data sources and variables construction. Section 4 provides empirical strategy and descriptive statistics. Section 5 presents results and robustness checks.

We use a within-subject design and a large-scale dataset of adults in an incentivized setting. The performance decrement is large despite the subjects working in a fully climate-controlled environment. Using secondary data, we find evidence of partial adaptation at the organizational, individual and biological levels. The results are interpreted in the context of climate models that observe and predict an increase in the frequency of very cold days in some locations (e.g. Chicago) and a decrease in others (e.g. Beijing).","How is the cognitive performance (“mental productivity”) of people working indoors, in climate-protected environments, impacted by outdoor cold? To what extent can adaptation at the organizational, personal, or biological level insulate against any decrement in performance?====This paper provides what we believe to be first evidence that outdoor cold has a detrimental impact on performance, and to speak in detail to issues of adaptation. Data comes from a large sample of subjects in a fully-incentivized setting.====Understanding the link from exterior temperature to indoor work is a key step in any projection of how a changing climate might impact productivity in sectors that are not as obviously climate-exposed as, for example, agriculture and tourism. While the attention of climate research in economics has been on increasing average temperatures and the effects of hot days on human outcomes, there is a dearth of evidence of any impacts of cold. This is an important gap in knowledge because climate models predict changes in the frequency of cold weather.==== Even as average temperatures increase, some places will experience more very cold days by the end of this century (e.g. Chicago), while other places will experience less (e.g. Beijing). The effect of cold on the human body and behavior is distinct from that of heat and works through different channels. Furthermore, there exists evidence that the mechanisms for adaptation are different.====The outcome data that we use for performance is 638,238 exams taken by 66,715 adult students over a 9 year period at the University of Ottawa, a large, comprehensive, research-intensive public university. It operates from a main campus located in the heart of the capital city. While the extent to which impacts on exam performance would also be seen in workplace productivity is an open question, academic scoring reflects a clean measure of mental proficiency which, at a minimum, seems likely to correlate with performance in a range of brain-intensive work tasks. At least three features of our setting make it an ideal context to explore our research question:====Secondary data allows us to investigate non-organizational adaptation. While an employer, for example, can heat the workplace, there are actions that individuals can take to protect against outdoor temperature conditions. We test whether reducing direct exposure through living close to place of work provides mitigation. To investigate the hypothesis that personal protection against extreme cold can be purchased (buying better winter clothing, using taxis on cold days, etc.) we investigate how temperature sensitivity relates to a proxy for subject income. To probe biological adaptation to cold conditions we (a) compare the sensitivity to treatment of domestic students with those from overseas (in particular from a set of hot countries) and, (b) examine how the sensitivity of the latter group evolves with repeated exposure.====We find a negative impact of outdoor temperature on indoor performance. The effect is substantial. In our preferred specification, which includes student fixed effects, year fixed effects, and controls for other weather conditions, a ten degree (1.75 standard deviations) Celsius colder outdoor temperature on exam day causes a reduction of about one-twelfth (8.09%) of a standard deviation in performance. The magnitude and significance of the effects prove highly robust to a wide range of tests. We speak to issues of mechanisms indirectly by characterizing the (less-than-complete) efficacy of adaptive strategies at various levels. While our study relates to adults taking university-level exams, such performance effects might be expected in a wider range of mentally-demanding tasks in the workplace.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review some pertinent existing research. In Section 3, we detail our administrative and weather data. Section 4 presents our identification strategy.

However, the air pollution effect has dramatically decreased over the past two decades: before 2003, a 10-unit increase in the Air Pollution Index could lead to a 3.1% increase in monthly cardio-respiratory mortality, but this effect has declined to 0.5% using recent data and is no longer statistically significant. Exploratory analyses suggest that a well-functioning medical system and immediate access to emergency services can help mitigate the contemporaneous effects of pollution on mortality.","Hong Kong (HK) is an autonomous territory, and a former British colony, in southeastern China. The city has about 7.5 million people and among the highest per capita incomes in the world.==== Notably, HK people have the highest life expectancy in the world, with male life expectancy being 81.32 years and female life expectancy being 87.34 years in 2017. Unlike other rich economies in the rest of the world, however, air quality in HK is poor and transboundary air pollution is a serious concern. For example, the annual average concentration of particulate matter (PM====) in HK was 45 μg/m==== from 2000 to 2015, which was more than twice WHO’s recommended level of 20 μg/m====. The NO==== concentration was 63 μg/m==== during this period, roughly 1.5 times higher than the WHO’s corresponding threshold.====This study estimates the causal impact of air pollution on mortality using 16 years’ of micro-level death data from HK. Our identification strategy builds on the fact that transboundary pollution (i.e., pollution transmitted from mainland China) plays an important role in determining HK’s air quality. HK is located near mainland China’s Pearl River Delta Economic Zone (PRDEZ), a major manufacturing center. Emissions from heavy industrial activities in the PRDEZ are brought to HK by wind, creating exogenous variations in local air quality. Using instruments based on the combinations of wind direction, air pollution in the PRDEZ, and distance between the PRDEZ and different districts of HK, we show that air pollution causes more people to die from cardio-respiratory diseases. Specifically, we estimate that a 10-unit increase in the Air Pollution Index (API) can cause a 1.77% increase in monthly cardio-respiratory mortality.==== The elderly are particularly vulnerable to air pollution, with a 10-unit change in the API leading to an 8.41% change in mortality. To understand how the air pollution effect changes over time, we split the sample by different sub-periods and find that the effect has been diminishing in the past two decades. Further analyses reveal that the diminishing effect is likely to be driven by medical improvement initiatives and the advancement of community-based healthcare services after the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic, not by changes in avoidance behaviors or public awareness of air pollution.====This study makes two primary contributions to the existing literature. First, this study is among the first efforts to estimate the causal health effects of air pollution in a high-income and high-pollution context. Existing literature mostly focuses on developed countries with a low level of pollution, such as the U.S. and the E.U., or developing countries with a high level of pollution, such as China and India. The high-income high-pollution setting is important because the air pollution effect can be non-linear and the pollution-mortality relationship may be altered by better institutional, and socio-economic background (====; ====). Within the small set of studies that focus on HK, most of them are associational studies that may suffer from endogeneity concerns (e.g., ====; ====; ====; ====). The only exception is ====, a concurrent study that also emphasizes the importance of investigating Hong Kong. ==== focus on how air pollution affects birth weight and infant mortality and find that while air pollution can reduce the birth weight of babies, it does not kill them. We differ from ==== in that we focus on different health outcomes (mortality for different age groups vs. infant health), adopt a different identification strategy (transboundary pollution vs. thermal inversion), and try to pin down the exact channels through which the pollution-mortality relationship can be moderated.====This paper also provides the first evidence that air pollution impact can be significantly mitigated by better medical institutions and provision of high-quality health care. Specifically, we show that the air pollution effect has significantly reduced after the SARS epidemic, during which HK government made massive investments and structural reforms in healthcare systems. We also find that the air pollution effect is larger for districts that do not have a hospital with Accident and Emergency (A&E) services, highlighting the critical role of emergency care in saving vulnerable people from dying from air pollution attacks. Several alternative explanations, including non-linear dose-response between pollution and mortality, smoking, and avoidance behavior, can be ruled out after further analyzing relevant data. Our finding suggests that a well-established medical system can help mitigate the contemporaneous health effect of air pollution, which also partly explains why HK people can have the longest life expectancy in the world despite breathing relatively dirty air.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. ==== discusses air pollution in HK, existing evidence, and our empirical strategy. ==== describes our data and presents some stylized facts about HK and the PRDEZ’s air quality.

I exploit temporal variation in decades-long averages of weather and estimate crop acreage elasticities with respect to climate change in the United States. I find substantial climate change adaptation through acreage adjustments in US agriculture. Climate change explains about 10–35% of the observed US corn and soybean expansion over the past 30 years, and climate-driven crop substitution has played an important role. The acreage response is heterogeneous across major and minor producing areas and across dryland and irrigated counties.","Agriculture is an industry highly sensitive to climate change (IPCC, 2014). Focusing on crop yields, a vast literature has documented the negative impact of climate change on agriculture and its threat on future food security (Schlenker and Roberts, 2009; Schlenker and Lobell, 2010; Welch et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2016; Gammans et al., 2017; Schauberger et al., 2017). The concern becomes even more pressing as recent studies find minimal climate adaptability in crop yields (e.g., Schlenker and Roberts, 2009; Burke and Emerick, 2016). However, climate change will also change comparative advantage in agriculture, and the induced crop reallocation can potentially mitigate the overall impact of climate change (Costinot et al., 2016). How much agriculture will adapt through changing cropping patterns is therefore very important for designing cost-effective policies for climate change adaptation.====This paper provides the first empirical estimate of acreage elasticities with respect to climate by examining how planted acres of US corn and soybeans respond to long-run climate change. As the largest producer of corn and soybeans in the world, the United States accounts for about 30–40% of the world's total exports of these two crops (USDA, 2017). Cropping patterns in the United States have also experienced substantial changes over the past few decades. From 1980 to 2016, the planted acres of corn and soybeans in the United States increased by 11.9% and 19.3%, respectively, while wheat acres experienced a 43.2% reduction (USDA, 2016).==== The shift in acres was substantial in the Northern Plains and the Upper Midwest, where both temperature and precipitation have increased (Melillo et al., 2014). While favorable market conditions and technological improvements, such as advances in biotechnology, have been recognized as leading factors driving the changing acres (e.g., Olmstead and Rhode, 2011; Roberts and Schlenker, 2013; Barrows et al., 2014), the contribution of climate change is not well understood.====In this paper, I estimate how climate change affects the planted acres of corn and soybeans using US county-level data by exploiting the temporal variation in long-run climate change rather than short-run weather fluctuations. Guided by the scientific literature, relevant climate information is summarized by ====, defined by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as “three-decade averages of climatological variables including temperature and precipitation.” In a panel fixed effects estimation, the key variation comes from the within-county variation in climate normals that reflects the gradually updated local climate. Because the regional comparative advantage evolves differently as the regional climate endowments differ, I explicitly allow for spatially heterogeneous acreage response in the estimation.====I find that rising temperature and precipitation have increased the planted acres of corn and soybeans in cool and dry areas, but decreased their acres in warm and moist areas. The results are robust to a set of different specifications and not sensitive to the inclusion of additional socioeconomic and policy relevant controls. I also show that short-run weather fluctuation does not confound the effect of long-run climate change, and climate effects differ significantly from weather effects on acreage.====In terms of semi-elasticities of corn and soybean acreage with respect to climate, a uniform 0.1 °C increase in the 30-year average growing-season temperature would lead to a 0.9% acreage reduction, while a uniform 1 cm increase in the 30-year average of growing-season precipitation would induce a 4.0% acreage increase. Referring to the observed temporal variability of climate normals, the response to temperature change is less elastic than the response to precipitation change.====A comparison with price elasticities in the literature suggests that corn and soybean acreage is less responsive to changing climate than to changing prices. However, given the persistency in climate change over decades, the climate-driven acreage change is still substantial. Based on the preferred estimates, a back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that 10–35% of the observed US corn and soybean acreage expansion since 1980 can be explained by climate change. From another perspective, about 1.1–3.8% of the current US total corn and soybean outputs would not have been realized had no climate change over the past three decades, assuming average yields on the expanded acres. Bringing in additional acreage data, I also show that the acreage response of corn and soybeans is partly realized through acreage substitution with other major crops.====There is some heterogeneity in corn and soybean acreage response across major and minor producing areas. In particular, major areas in the cool region is much more responsive to warming, reflecting a lower adjustment cost relative to minor areas. Another dimension of response heterogeneity is related to irrigation. Using a subset of counties with detailed irrigation information, I show that the effect of climate change on irrigated acreage is very limited, especially for the precipitation effect. As irrigation breaks the linkage between crop growth and precipitation, more rainfall in dry areas no longer serves as a strong incentive for growers to expand their corn and soybean acres.====Previous studies on climate change impacts on agricultural supply largely focus on weather impacts on crop yields. On one hand, these estimated effects may only capture limited adaptability to long-run change in the climate, potentially biasing the predicted impacts of climate change (Hsiang, 2016; Blanc and Schlenker, 2017; Mendelsohn and Massetti, 2017; Carter et al., 2018).==== On the other hand, crop acreage is typically assumed to be fixed, which precludes the potential mitigation effects associated with induced acreage adjustments.====An early strand of literature has related micro-level crop choice to different climatic characteristics (e.g., Kurukulasuriya and Mendelsohn, 2007; Seo and Mendelsohn, 2008; Wang et al., 2010). Due to the cross-sectional nature of these studies, their results are prone to the omitted variable bias. Recently, some attempts have been made to estimate acreage adjustments to climate change using panel estimation (Miao et al., 2016; Cohn et al., 2016). However, their identification is based on weather variation so that the results mostly reflect acreage response to short-run weather shocks rather than long-run climate change.====By providing the first rigorous empirical estimation of acreage response to changing climate, this paper contributes to the understanding of climate change impacts in several ways. An innovation in this paper is to use long-average weather, as a proxy for climate, in a panel fixed effects estimation framework. This strategy permits identifying climate change effects directly. By demonstrating significant climate effects on crop acreage, this paper highlights an important adjustment margin that has been overlooked in the recent economics literature on climate change. The reduced-form estimates in this paper complement the structural estimation of climate-induced crop reallocation in Costinot et al. (2016), strengthening the finding of agricultural adaptation to climate change through changing cropping patterns. The spatial pattern of the estimated acreage response also echoes the early predictions made under the production-function approach as well as the theoretical predictions in the Ricardian literature (Adams et al., 1990; Mendelsohn et al., 1994).====The heterogeneity in acreage response across major and minor producing areas illustrates that expanding crop production to new regions may face more obstacles. This finding also links to the recent discussion of high switching cost in the supply response literature (Scott, 2013; Gouel and Laborde, 2018).==== The heterogeneous response found on irrigated acreage builds on the literature on the role of irrigation in climate change adaptation (e.g., Schlenker et al., 2005, 2006; Tack et al., 2012; Taraz, 2017). In particular, this paper finds that local yield adaptation supported by irrigation may provide disincentives for adaptation through acreage adjustments, linking to discussions of the effectiveness of water institutions in adapting to climate change (Libecap, 2011).",Climate change and adaptation in agriculture: Evidence from US cropping patterns,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069620300292,4 March 2020,2020,Research Article,246.0

If car owners care about the emissions of their cars, we expect the used-car market to react to the arrival of new information about the emissions of cars. One possible reaction is sorting based on heterogeneous preferences for environmental quality (see, e.g., Hendel and Lizzeri, 1999, for a comprehensive discussion of sorting in markets for durable goods under heterogeneous preferences). Car owners with high preferences for environmental quality could sell their cars to individuals with low preferences for environmental quality. The green consumer theory argues that owners of environmentally sustainable cars have a higher preference for environmental quality than the average car owner (e.g., Kahn, 2007). Accordingly, owners of environmentally sustainable cars should have strong sorting motives when new information arrives about the lower environmental quality of their cars.====In this study, we exploit the decline in the observed environmental quality of Volkswagen (VW) diesel cars after the disclosure of the stunning VW emissions scandal to investigate reactions to information disclosure. On September 18, 2015, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) disclosed the installation of defeat device software in the emission control systems of VW diesel engines (EPA, 2015). This disclosure reduced the observable environmental quality of VW diesel cars because the defeat device negatively affects the environmental and engine performance of the manipulated cars. Furthermore, the durability of several parts of the exhaust system (e.g., the catalytic converter) could significantly decline after retrofitting, thus increasing maintenance costs. Since market participants did not expect the information revealed by this disclosure, the resulting decline in observable environmental quality is a quasi-experimental exogenous shock to the used-car market.====VW advertised the cars with defeat devices under environmentally sustainable labels. Accordingly, the buyers of VW cars with defeat device should have a higher preference for environmental quality than the average car owner (following the arguments of the green consumer theory). This should create motives for sorting in the used car market after the disclosure of the emission scandal.====Several studies show that car buyers’ willingness to pay is sensitive to fuel prices (e.g., Allcott and Wozny, 2013; Busse et al., 2013; Sallee et al., 2016). These studies argue that car buyers take the future fuel costs of vehicles with different fuel economies into account. Banzhaf and Kasim (2019) investigate sorting of cars based on the fuel economy between households with high and low frequencies of car use. They provide evidence that households with a high frequency of car use switch to cars with a better fuel economy when gasoline prices increase. We contribute to this literature by providing evidence for sorting based on preferences for environmental quality.====Tadelis and Zettelmeyer (2015) investigate the random disclosure of information (for potential bidders) about the quality of used cars during online auctions. The unexpected disclosure of new information increases the sales probability and the revenue for sellers. Surprisingly, the results remain the same regardless of whether the disclosed information increases or decreases the observable quality. They argue that the (re-) sorting of bidders with heterogeneous quality preferences increases competition, even if the new information reveals low quality. In contrast to Tadelis and Zettelmeyer (2015), we focus on the arrival of new information related to environmental quality.====Peterson and Schneider (2014) investigate the defect probability of different car components and the corresponding turnover rates for different car models. Components with a high probability of an easily detectable defect increase the turnover rates of cars. This is evidence for sorting with respect to observable car quality. However, it is difficult to test the causal effect of information disclosure on the supply of used cars because we are usually unable to observe exogenous variation in observable used-car quality. Furthermore, Peterson and Schneider (2014) do not consider car components that affect the environmental quality of cars.====We base our analyses on data collected from a large German online car advertisement portal. The volume of this online market is approximately 3.6 million cars per year, which reflects a trade value of 40 billion euros per year or 50% of the German used-car market.==== Our sample contains 1.1 million newly offered cars between August 2015 and April 2016. Furthermore, we observe detailed car and seller characteristics. We employ conditional difference-in-differences estimators to investigate asking prices and market shares of diesel cars by carmakers and time periods before and after the disclosure of the VW emission scandal. The conditional difference-in-differences approach accounts for important variables that could affect the structure of the used-car market. For this purpose, we use semi-parametric radius matching estimators with bias adjustment (Lechner et al., 2011).====We find that the supply of used VW diesel cars increases significantly after the disclosure of the emission manipulation scandal. The positive supply effects increase with the probability of manipulation. Furthermore, we find evidence of negative effects on asking prices for cars with a high probability of manipulation. We rationalize these findings using Peterson and Schneider's (2016) model of sorting in durable goods markets. The findings support the notion that owners of environmental sustainable cars have a higher preference for quality than the average car owner. This enables the owners of manipulated VW cars to (partly) externalize the utility loss imposed by the emission scandal by selling the car to buyers with relatively low preferences for environmental quality.====We provide evidence that spillover effects to non-manipulated VW diesel cars do not explain an increase in the supply or decline in the asking price of used cars. This mitigates the plausibility of several alternative explanations for our findings, for example, that the overall expected reliability of diesel cars decreases after the disclosure of the scandal or that mainly risk averse car owners bring their used cars to market.====Furthermore, we provide evidence that these results are strongly driven by the supply of minivans and sport utility vehicles (SUVs). Compact cars drive the negative asking price effects. This suggests that owners of VW minivans and SUVs can (partly) externalize the loss of the environmental quality to buyers with a relatively low preference for environmental quality. In contrast, owners of other VW compact cars have to bear the full costs of the scandal, since they can only sell their cars with high price reductions.====In the next section, we introduce the background of the VW emission scandal. In Section 3, we introduce a small sorting model. In Section 4, we describe the data. In Section 5, we explain our empirical strategy. In Section 6, we report the empirical results. In Section 7, we discuss alternative explanations for our findings. The final section draws conclusions.

Behavioral nudges or interventions such as information provision, social comparisons, commitment devices, and others have been shown to be effective in diverse contexts: smoking cessation, education, exercise and weight loss, energy and water conservation.==== Yet, often little is understood about how and why these interventions work. Understanding the underlying mechanisms has important implications for welfare effects as well as the external validity of particular nudges for other settings.====Our study focuses on understanding the mechanisms driving an especially policy relevant behavioral intervention: Home Energy Reports (HERs). HERs provide information about a household's own energy usage, how that compares with neighbors' usage, and estimated monetary savings from several suggested conservation actions. The reports have been shown to be remarkably cost-effective: a simple additional section to consumers' monthly bills produces energy savings that range from 2 to 6%.====We introduce HERs into a new environment, college dormitories, where tenants do not directly pay for energy. Focusing on this setting allows us to make two contributions to our understanding of social comparison nudges. First, our interventions solely target behavioral channels for reductions, such as competitiveness, social norms, or moral suasion, which could operate independently from direct monetary incentives. Second, to the extent that our subjects are representative of how other populations respond to HERs, we can learn whether those nudges are likely to be effective when tenants make choices about energy consumption, but landlords pay the bills. Approximately 21% of rented residential properties are under landlord-pay contracts for energy (EIA, 2015), and for commercial buildings that figure is close to 20% (Jessoe et al., 2019). If tenants under these types of contracts respond to HERs with consumption reduction, then HERs could be an important lever to help ameliorate moral hazard for consumers who otherwise have little incentive to conserve.====Social comparisons like HERs are becoming an increasingly important policy mechanism for addressing energy conservation, where price-based approaches are often difficult to design and implement. In some parts of the world, such as the United States, it has been politically infeasible to implement large-scale Pigouvan taxes or cap-and-trade programs for carbon emissions. While energy efficiency subsidies are used more widely, they are difficult to design optimally without knowledge of elasticities of demand for both energy consumption and efficiency in durables.==== These difficulties with traditional price-based approaches, combined with the remarkable cost-effectiveness of HERs, have led to widespread use of that intervention. As of mid-2015, leading HER provider, Opower, was working with close to 100 utility companies in 9 different countries, sending regular letters to 15 million households (Allcott and Kessler, 2019).====A few hypotheses have been advanced as to why HERs have been successful in promoting conservation: they may serve as continuous reminders of the monetary savings opportunities (addressing consumer inattention); may appeal to competitiveness and (above average) consumers' desires not to feel out of the norm (social norms, see: Bénabou and Tirole, 2006; Levitt and List, 2007); may increase the moral burden of being an above average user (moral suasion, see: Ito et al., 2018); may simply empower subjects with information to act on previously established intention; or could combine all of those and other factors.====In order to better understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of HERs, we conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) for heating and cooling in a university undergraduate residence hall, where students do not directly pay energy bills. As in most residences where tenants do not pay for energy, participants in our study also could not make significant capital investments. That implies that we can estimate the effect of HERs in a setting where behavioral channels, rather than pecuniary motives, are the primary mechanisms that affect energy consumption.====Previous literature has explored the effects of energy conservation nudges in the context of campus housing. Delmas and Lessem (2014) recruited students using an opt-in design for a study at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Randomizing within the 4.4% of the population that opted to participate, they show that public displays of least versus most efficient consumers can reduce electricity usage by almost 20%. Another treatment arm of that study looks at the effect of providing private energy usage information to students, along with average usage of a comparable neighbor. However, the treatment effect for that group was not statistically distinguishable from zero. Further, the design of their reports differed substantially from those provided by Opower.====Our trials take place in an upper-division undergraduate residence hall from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. We used an opt-out recruitment design, with a 99% participation rate.==== We randomly assigned 2/3 of subjects to receive weekly HERs via email (remaining 1/3 of subjects were control).==== Thermostat observations were used to generate personalized heating/cooling energy reports for treatment rooms, designed to closely replicate HERs used by utilities in traditional residential contexts. Our results reveal no statistically significant change in behavior for the treatment group compared to control. Our estimates are precise enough to rule out reductions of the size found in traditional residential contexts. When residents pay for energy, an estimated 45–67% of the 2–6% short-run savings come through behavioral channels rather than through capital investments (Brandon et al., 2017).==== We can rule out thermostat changes greater than 0.36 °F, which suggests that HERs do not change behavior in our context.====There are a few aspects about our population and our setting that differ from the traditional residential context (homeowners from the general population who pay utility bills). However, we argue that our experimental setting is a feature of our study in several ways. As discussed above, hypotheses are that HERs nudges work either due to competitiveness, social norms, and moral suasion (behavioral channels), or due to new information (on neighbor consumption) about monetary savings opportunities, or a combination of those factors. We reiterate that our setting eliminates the motivation to use HER information for monetary gains. Thus, if behavioral channels are a primary driver of HER treatment effects in the traditional residential context, then our estimated null effects imply that behavioral factors are much less effective for a student population. However, it can be argued that our subjects tend to have “greener” preferences and place a heightened importance on peers, such that the effects of competitiveness, social norms, and moral suasion would likely be stronger with a student population, compared to standard residential contexts.====Two other important differences between our setting and the traditional residential context are that 1) we focus on thermostats (as opposed to plug load), such that we only look at behavioral changes related to heating/cooling demand, and 2) we deliver the HERs intervention through email. One might worry that behavioral responses in our context are limited due to those differences. However, we highlight that recent evaluations show that emailed home energy reports are just as effective as physical mailed reports, at least in standard residential settings (Henry et al., 2019). Further, results from two additional studies, one performed in a different location and one performed with our population, point to the important role of the lack of financial incentives in driving our results.====First, in a study that closely mirrors ours in almost all respects, except that the tenants do pay for energy, Brülisauer et al. (2018) find strong treatment effects of the HER intervention. Like our study, their randomized controlled trial: 1) took place in a student dormitory over a short time frame (less than one semester), 2) focused exclusively on air-conditioning usage (as opposed to plug load), 3) used weekly e-mails to deliver HERs, 4) used an opt-out recruitment design. In fact, their results suggest that focusing on one behavioral channel (cooling) could make HERs more effective than nudges promoting energy conservation on all fronts. It might be more effective to increase consumers' engagement with high-return conservation activities related to heating and cooling, rather that turning off lights or shutting off computers, which have less energy savings potential.====While Brülisauer et al. (2018) offer convincing evidence that an energy-paying student population may respond to weekly emailed HERs focused only on heating and cooling, it could still be the case that students in our context are less attentive and responsive to emails than their population. The Brülisauer et al. (2018) study took place in Singapore, which might have a student population that is demographically and culturally very different from students in the United States. We therefore offer evidence from a second randomized controlled trial in our setting, which demonstrates that our subjects did open and read emails from our sender. Further, we demonstrate that they knew how to reduce their thermostat settings, and were willing to do so before leaving their rooms for an extended period of time (winter break), even though they opted not to significantly lower settings during the HERs study period.====At the end of our HER study period, we re-randomized rooms into treatment and control, and sent simpler messages to the treatment group, asking students to turn down their thermostats to 68 °F before leaving for winter break.==== Students are unlikely to be occupying their rooms during break, such that heating demand might be lower for all of them. Messages for this secondary experiment came from the same sender as that from our main trial, and arrived during finals week, a very busy time for students, when cognitive costs may be considered higher than usual. Nevertheless, the simple nudges prior to winter break were successful in promoting a 1.1 °F setpoint reduction for treated rooms (approximately 1.5% of the full sample average setpoint; or 43% of the average within-room, across-time setpoint variance during the Fall semester).====The significant treatment effect during winter break suggests that the null effect from HERs during the regular semester is unlikely to have been driven by inattention (i.e. students not opening or not reading emails from our sender). The strong effect prior to break demonstrates that students were still opening, reading, and reacting to emails from our sender at the end of our HERs study period. Further, it demonstrates that students understood how to make changes to thermostat settings for energy conservation. Therefore, it is not the case that subjects tried to respond to the HERs but did not understand how to do so. They were willing to make changes to thermostat settings, at least during a period with very different energy demands. The nudges might have worked before break because students knew that they would not experience thermal discomfort (colder rooms) during the time that they expected to be away.==== Post-study surveys of students are also suggestive that they were receiving the HERs and reading them, but they did not feel compelled to change their behavior during the semester.====To the extent that our findings can be extrapolated to other non-dormitory residential contexts, they may have important implications for policymakers considering HERs to promote conservation in contexts where tenants do not pay their energy bills. We present some reasons why our results from thermostat settings in college dormitories might extend to other such contexts. First, we argue that our focus on thermostats alone was not a significant limiting factor in terms of behavioral responses. We note the that prior literature found large behavioral responses to cooling-only HERs in dormitory settings similar to ours in almost all respects, except that tenants did pay for energy (Brülisauer et al., 2018). In addition, our population was willing to make substantial changes to their thermostats in response to a simple request to conserve while they were away from their residence during winter break. Second, if behavioral channels were a primary driver of response to HERs in typical residential settings, then our null result would imply that college students are particularly unresponsive to behavioral nudges. However, we argue that this seems unlikely, given that college students tend to place a heightened importance on peers, so that the effects of competitiveness, social norms, and moral suasion would, if anything, be stronger with a student population, compared to standard residential contexts.====Given their low costs and ease of implementation, simple HERs nudges may seem attractive to policymakers for changing behavior in contexts where monetary incentives are not present, such as when tenants do not pay utility bills. However, assuming that our findings can be extrapolated to other non-dormitory residential contexts, they suggest that social comparisons like those offered in HERs may not be effective at changing consumption behavior in those environments.====The following sections provide further details about this study. In Section 2 we present a conceptual framework and derive testable hypotheses related to the impact of HERs in our setting. Section 3 describes our research design.

We show that within this dynamic oligopolistic framework, ==== may lead to a lower discounted sum of ","A significant and rising share of world trade consists of natural resources.==== This includes trade in renewable resources such as fish. For example, world exports of fish increased by 60 per cent from 33 million tonnes to 53 million tonnes between 1990 and 2007, according to statistics from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). In value terms, world fish exports rose from $53 billion in 1998 to $98 billion in 2008. In Canada, for instance, fisheries products are the largest single food commodity export.==== Trade in certain renewable resources is further facilitated by the structure of tariffs they face in export markets with tariff rates rising with the stage of processing. Policy analysis regarding trade in renewable resources is complicated by the fact that their extraction often generates negative externalities. In the case of fisheries, open access in the absence of well defined property rights may lead to over-exploitation and eventual depletion of the resource stock if each firm aims to maximize its individual profit without internalizing the impact of its own extraction on rivals' extraction prospects. Thus, for common property resources, a dynamic analysis is warranted since current policies are inextricably linked with welfare of future generations. In this paper, we use a differential game to examine whether policies that promote Free Trade in such resources improve the welfare of trading partners.====Our model setup consists of ==== countries with one firm each. All firms extract the renewable resource from a common pool. Each country also consumes the resource. Thus, under Autarky, each country is served by a monopolist. Under Free Trade, the firms compete in quantities in a single integrated market. Our setting reflects the market structure in industries such as fish where a few large fishing companies behave oligopolistically in the global market.==== The firms use closed loop strategies such that, at any instant in time, each firm's extraction is a function of the resource stock, which in turn depends on the extraction of all firms. The advantage of using closed loop strategies is that they yield subgame perfect Nash equilibria, while open loop strategies, where extraction is a function of time but not the stock, typically do not.====We note that a number of papers in the previous literature have used a differential game framework with closed loop strategies to analyze common property resources, although they analyze a closed economy context rather than allowing for trade across countries. For example, Benchekroun (2003) examines the impact of unilateral production restrictions, while Benchekroun (2008) examines the effect of changes in the natural growth rate of the stock and of the number of firms. These papers, together with Lambertini and Mantovani (2014, 2016) characterize the subgame perfect Nash equilibria of a common property duopoly, highlighting different features. They show that extraction strategies and value functions take a piecewise-linear form, which depends on the resource stock level. There can be a unique or multiple long-run stationary equilibria, depending on the parameters of the model. Also, non-linear feedback solutions may be unstable. Fujiwara (2008) builds on Benchekroun (2003) to show that linear feedback strategies lead to a smaller output than monopoly, static duopoly and non-linear feedback strategies. Taking into account such strategic behaviour and possible non-linearities of the growth of the resource stock, Colombo and Labrecciosa, 2013a, Colombo and Labrecciosa, 2013b examine the role of property rights and convergence to the Cournot equilibrium, while others characterize the optimal taxation policy (see, for example, Kossioris et al., 2011). Within a similar setting, while Fujiwara (2011) examines losses from competition, Benchekroun and Gaudet (2015) study the impact of mergers. Benchekroun and Long (2016) introduce a concept of firms’ social status which depends either on extraction levels or profit levels, while Grilli and Bisceglia (2017) consider a finite planning horizon. Vardar and Zaccour (2018) extend Benchekroun (2008) by introducing pollution externalities that are generated as a by-product of extraction. We contribute to this literature by comparing the equilibria under Autarky and Free Trade within a setting similar to that used in the above papers.====Another paper to compare Autarky and Free Trade in a differential game context is Fujiwara (2009), which examines the effect of trade liberalization on a polluting oligopoly where firms emit an accumulative pollutant as a by-product of the production process. Since Fujiwara (2009) does not model a renewable resource sector, the state variable is a pollution stock rather than a resource stock, and there is a quadratic cost associated with pollution. We note that the increasing segment of the growth function of the resource in our paper is similar in terms of mathematical expression to the state equation considered in Fujiwara (2009). While Fujiwara (2009) focuses on steady state analysis, our contribution is to examine how trade liberalization affects aggregate welfare over time after accounting for how the transition to the steady state is affected by moving from Autarky to Free Trade.====Our work is more closely related to Fujiwara and Shinozaki (2010) which examines the effect of trade liberalization in a common property duopoly. They find that although the effect of reductions in trade costs on welfare is non-monotonic, welfare under Autarky is unambiguously higher than that under Free Trade, a result that is in contrast to that derived in static models and driven by the feedback strategies used by firms. Our model setting differs from Fujiwara and Shinozaki (2010) in the following ways. In our paper, under Free Trade, there exists a single integrated market rather than markets that are segmented across countries. We include ==== > 2 firms in our oligopoly. Moreover, while Fujiwara and Shinozaki (2010) focus solely on the steady state welfare level, we also analyze the effect of moving from Autarky to Free Trade on the transition to the steady state. It is important to augment the steady state analysis presented in earlier papers by taking into account the relevant intertemporal trade offs faced by policy makers within this context. Since consumers are shown to be better off in the short run and worse off in the long run due to trade liberalization, we contribute to the policy debate surrounding trade in renewable resources by determining the conditions under which the long-run effects outweigh the short-run effects of trade.====Another paper to focus on aggregate consumer surplus over time for a common pool renewable resource sector, using a closed-loop differential game model, is Colombo and Labrecciosa (2018). They examine the impact of increased cooperation between firms, rather than that of freer trade. They show that increased cooperation makes consumers worse off in the short run and better off in the long run such that the discounted sum of consumer surplus increases in cooperation for initial stock levels below a threshold. An important distinction between our framework and the one used in Colombo and Labrecciosa (2018) is that, in our paper, under Autarky the countries’ markets (and thereby the demand functions faced by each monopolist) are separate whereas in Colombo and Labrecciosa (2018) firms, whether they face a short-run output restriction or not, always sell in the integrated market. While in our paper each firm under Free Trade faces a larger market size than under Autarky (a salient feature of trade liberalization in practice), in Colombo and Labrecciosa (2018) each firm faces the same larger market regardless of the degree of cooperation. Thus, the move from Autarky to Free Trade, as captured in our paper, is qualitatively different from the move from full cooperation to non-cooperation and its analysis cannot be inferred from the findings of Colombo and Labrecciosa (2018). Therefore, the impact of trade liberalization merits a separate analysis, especially in light of the increasing empirical significance of international trade in renewable resources.====Our first contribution is to show that, within our context, the steady state stock level is unambiguously lower under Free Trade than under Autarky, implying that the externalities due to open access are exacerbated by allowing for trade. This result points to a parallel with the exhaustible resources literature. As shown by Hotelling (1931) and Solow (1974), in the context of exhaustible resources, the “monopolist is the conservationist's friend.” We obtain a similar result in the context of a renewable resource in that the steady state stock of the resource is highest when there is monopoly extraction of the resource under Autarky. However, we would like to point out that the Autarky and Free Trade scenarios in our framework cannot be generated by a comparative statics with respect to the number of firms. This is because, in our framework, when under Autarky a firm is a monopolist in its market, it has access to a smaller market than under Free Trade.====This result, that is, the steady state stock level is unambiguously lower under Free Trade than under Autarky, is also in line with empirical observations. While world exports of fish increased by 60 per cent between 1990 and 2007, world fisheries production rose by 42 per cent from 98 million tonnes to 140 million tonnes, according to FAO. However, annual catches from oceans and fresh water fisheries were constant during this period, at around 90 million tonnes, with most of the growth in production and trade accounted for by aquaculture. These statistics have raised concerns that the world's oceans and fresh water fisheries may have reached peak production and could be over-exploitated in the face of growing demand, as summarised by the World Trade Report (2010). This may also explain why renewable resources are twice as likely to face export taxes as other sectors, as noted in the WTO's Trade Policy Reviews.====The impact of trade on consumer surplus of an individual country is a priori ambiguous. On the one hand, the smaller resource stock in the long run leads to lower consumption (and consumer surplus) in the long run. At the same time, higher extraction in the short run leads to higher consumption (and consumer surplus) in the short run. A natural question that arises, and which has not been addressed in the previous literature, is whether consumers are better off due to freer trade once we aggregate their gains and losses over time. By capturing the transition dynamics, we are able to show that aggregate consumer surplus over time decreases due to freer trade as long as the stock does not exceed a certain threshold, in sharp contrast to most static trade models. Producer surplus always decreases with a move from Autarky to Free Trade. Together, the results on consumer and producer surplus imply that there exists a threshold in terms of the stock level below which aggregate social welfare over time is lower under Free Trade than under Autarky.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the benchmark case of Autarky. Section 3 presents the Free Trade scenario. Section 4 compares Autarky and Free Trade. All variables representing the Autarky scenario are denoted by the superscript “====″, while all variables respresenting the Free Trade scenario are denoted by the superscript “====”.

This paper examines how fracking-related trucking affects fatal crashes in North Dakota using the exogenous timing of fracking operations near a road segment. The results show that an additional post-fracking well within six miles of a road segment led to 8% more fatal crashes and 7.1% higher per-capita costs in accidents. Transport activities at wells’ other operational stages did not affect fatal crashes. These additional fatal crashes emerged mainly from collisions involving trucks, resulted from a higher traffic volume rather than a higher crash rate and occurred during daytime rush hours rather than during the rest of the day. Alcohol-involved drivers increased among these fatal crashes most likely due to their vulnerability to heavier fracking-induced traffic rather than more alcohol-involved truck drivers near the fracking sites.","Since the late 2000s, the prevalence of hydraulic fracturing, a.k.a. fracking, has triggered a nationwide shale oil and gas extraction boom in the United States. The literature on the regional economic effects shows that the shale energy boom generates employment, wage earnings, royalty and business income, and positive spillovers to neighboring regions (Munasib and Rickman, 2015; Feyrer et al., 2017; Maniloff and Mastromanaco, 2017). However, the created jobs and income may have exaggerated the regional welfare gains, because local amenities deteriorated as civil disturbances and violent crimes rose (James and Smith, 2017), water contamination was detected (Gopalakrishnan and Klaiber, 2014; Muehlenbachs et al., 2015), and disamenities such as dust, noise, and nightlights increased (New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC), 2015).====Among these studies, the growing traffic burden borne by the fracking boomtowns remains understudied (e.g., Food&Water Watch, 2013; Graham et al., 2015; Muehlenbachs et al., 2019). Compared with conventional oil and gas production, shale-energy extraction involves a more dispersed system of transport and infrastructure, which could affect a larger population and interfere with regional economic activity (Measham et al., 2016). From 2006 to 2015, many fracking boomtowns in the United States witnessed a surge in road fatalities whereas the national fatal crashes decreased by 17% (FracTracker Alliance, 2014; National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 2017). Despite various conjectures by the popular press about the reasons for the phenomenon (e.g., Urbina, 2012; Lohan, 2014), identifying a causal relationship is challenging because of confounders such as the influx of migrants and commuters to the fracking boomtowns (Food&Water Watch, 2013; Wilson, 2016). Although part of the spike may be explained by the growing population and commute vehicles, a more concerning cause is the heavy trucks servicing the energy sector. First, truck trips required by a fracking well are almost twice as many as needed by a conventional well due to intense fracking-induced water injection and wastewater disposal (NYSDEC, 2015). The concentrated truck traffic near the fracking sites could lead to more truck-involved crashes and even collisions among cars due to increased traffic volume. Second, trucks pose greater threats to other vehicles in collisions due to their higher front ends and heavier body structures (Li, 2012; Jacobsen, 2013; Anderson and Auffhammer, 2014). Thus, fracking-related trucking could result in severer crashes.====This study identifies the causal relationship between fracking-related truck traffic and fatal traffic crashes using empirical evidence from the Bakken Formation in North Dakota. Our identification strategy exploits monthly variations in truck traffic within a road segment arising from the exogenous timing of fracking activities nearby. Assuming that a road segment is more likely to be traversed by trucks servicing nearby wells rather than distant wells, we use the monthly-varying numbers of wells in various operational phases within a buffer zone of a road segment to capture the temporal changes in truck traffic. We measure the truck traffic related to fracking water injection by the number of nearby horizontal wells completed in the current month, to which off-site water is hauled and injected for fracking immediately after well completion (i.e., “fracking wells”). We measure the truck use related to wastewater disposal by the number of nearby horizontal wells completed in the previous month, from which post-fracking wastewater flowbacks are hauled away to the disposal sites (i.e., “post-fracking wells”). We focus on the fracking effects on fatal crashes, as measured by the impact of one more well near a road on the count of fatal crashes and the associated total and per-capita fatality and injury costs in terms of the Value of a Statistical Life (VSL). Our purpose differs from Muehlenbachs et al. (2019) that estimates the trucking effect, i.e., the effect of one more truck on the road on the number of car-on-car collisions and car insurance premiums paid by residents nearby. To isolate confounding traffic, we control for the number of newly drilled wells in the current month that captures the drilling equipment transport and commute vehicles (i.e., ""spud wells""). We also control for the number of producing wells that captures the traffic in regular oil and gas production. By contrast, Muehlenbachs et al. (2019) allows for a differential effect on truck routes closer to wells compared to those farther away, expecting smaller confounding effects for the latter because commuting workers are more likely to access wells through the former.====Our paper reveals a different aspect of accident externalities of the shale resources boom than what has been found in Muehlenbachs et al. (2019). In drilling towns of Pennsylvania, residents paid higher car insurance premiums because more trucks on the road induced more non-fatal car-on-car crashes whereas fatal crashes did not change much (Muehlenbachs et al., 2019). By contrast, as more fracking wells emerged in North Dakota, we find an increased number of (i.e., the ==== margin) and higher severity of (i.e., the ==== margin) truck-involved fatal crashes whereas car-on-car fatal crashes were not affected. About 80% of these truck crashes were truck-on-car collisions, and 20% were truck-only crashes. The identified effects occurred during wastewater disposal in the post-fracking stage rather than the water injection phase. On the extensive margin, fatal crashes increased by 8% due to an additional post-fracking well within six miles of a road segment, which was equivalent to 0.0038 fatal crashes for an average road segment. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that an additional 17 fatal crashes took place per year across the sampled road segments, representing a 49% increase relative to the annual crash counts of the drilling counties in North Dakota in the baseline year of 2006. These additional fatal crashes cost $197 million, or 1.26 times as much as the average annual federal non-tax revenues from the drilling counties in North Dakota from 2006 to 2014 (Office of Natural Resources Revenue, 2019). On the intensive margin, an additional post-fracking well within six miles of a road segment led to 7.1% higher per-capita costs in accidents or additional costs of $18,883 equivalently. A considerable portion of the increased costs, such as medical expenses and lost wages, might be borne by not-at-fault drivers. In nine drilling states that apply no-fault auto insurance laws,==== injured not-at-fault car drivers can sue at-fault truck drivers only when their injury severity meets certain statutory thresholds; otherwise, they pay for the personal injuries through their own insurance (Insurance Information Institute, 2018). Meanwhile, not-at-fault drivers have to bear the costs if truck drivers are underinsured or the trucking companies file bankruptcy, which is getting more common given the increasing medical costs and the VSL (Hymel et al., 2013; Muehlenbachs et al., 2019).====Our results provide evidence of the fracking effects on fatal crashes in a low-traffic scenario of North Dakota. This is a valuable addition to the findings of Muehlenbachs et al. (2019) because fracking has been widely applied in more than thirty U.S. states and its traffic impact is expected to vary dramatically with local road infrastructure, traffic regulations, population, etc. We estimate that one fracking well brought in an additional 3404 traffic counts per year in North Dakota, which is higher than the estimate of 645-1001 in Pennsylvania (Muehlenbachs et al., 2019), though the population density of the former is only 1/30 of that of the latter. Our estimate is nevertheless in the range of 2300–4000 reported by the FracTracker Alliance (2014). Given that the average daily traffic counts in our sample were 4663 compared with an average of 7574 in Muehlenbachs et al., 2019, our findings imply a higher share of fracking-induced traffic among the total traffic in North Dakota. This feature could contribute to the increased accident severity identified in our study, which are in line with findings in the transportation safety literature that heavier vehicles impose greater risk on others (Li, 2012; Jacobsen, 2013; Anderson and Auffhammer, 2014). There could be similar case in other states such as Montana, Wyoming, and New Mexico that also experienced a massive influx of truck traffic to rural drilling towns that used to be sparsely populated. This new knowledge contributes to a broader perspective of the overall regional costs and benefits tradeoff of the shale energy boom (Gopalakrishnan and Klaiber, 2014; Muehlenbachs et al., 2015; Munasib and Rickman, 2015; Feyrer et al., 2017; James and Smith, 2017; Maniloff and Mastromonaco, 2017).====We contribute to the literature by providing new insights into the underlying mechanisms, including the crash rate, the crash time patterns, and shifts in the crash drivers' characteristics and behavior. Our findings expand the literature about various legal interventions (Cohen and Einav, 2003; Cohen and Dehejia, 2004; Abouk and Adams, 2013), regulatory policies (Deangelo and Hansen, 2014), and economic tools (Adams et al., 2012) that affect traffic fatalities. We estimate that each well resulted in 3404 additional traffic counts in its fracking year but do not find changes in the crash rate. It suggests that the increased fatal crashes were caused by a higher traffic volume rather than a higher chance of accidents. We then show that fatal crashes occurred near the fracking sites mainly during the daytime rush hours but not during the rest of the day, which informs the specific hours that require traffic risk mitigation measures and adds to the literature on road safety management interventions (Mooren et al., 2014). In contrast to the evidence from Pennsylvania (Muehlenbachs et al., 2019), we also find that alcohol-involved drivers increased among the fatal crashes near the fracking sites, whereas over 95% of these drivers were driving cars. Although wells’ fracking operations were unlikely to alter the spatial distribution of drinking behavior, the share of alcohol-involved drivers could increase because they were more vulnerable to accidents than sober drivers in heavier traffic induced by fracking-related trucking. The suggestive evidence complements Levitt and Porter (2001) who finds that alcohol-involved drivers are at least seven times more likely to cause a fatal crash than sober drivers.",Fraccidents: The impact of fracking on road traffic deaths,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069620300267,6 February 2020,2020,Research Article,250.0

We use the US shale gas revolution as a quasi-natural experiment to analyse two extensive margins of adjustment by heterogeneous UK firms. First, we consider whether energy intensive UK firms have established new affiliates in the US in response to the shale gas shock. Second, we explore within-firm plant-level adjustments to consider whether the energy price gap increases the propensity for firms that have US operations to shut down their energy intensive UK plants. We find evidence in support of these two margins of adjustment. Taken together, these results suggest that ==== have relocated energy intensive production from the UK to the US due to the endowment-driven energy price gap.","Over recent years, trends in energy prices and energy independence have diverged across developed countries. In the US, the development of hydraulic fracturing (fracking) techniques has led to a considerable increase in the supply, and corresponding fall in the price, of natural gas and petroleum liquids. This contrasts with an increased reliance on energy imports in many other OECD countries, most notably in Europe. To take one example, the UK’s endowment of natural gas and oil has been in steady decline as the North Sea oil and gas fields have matured. Imported fuels are relatively expensive due to the economic costs of transportation, especially in the case of natural gas. Therefore, industrial natural gas prices are now around 2.6 times higher in the UK than the US (on average for 2012–2015). Fig. 1 illustrates the close relationship between the natural gas endowment gap and the absolute price gap for the UK-US, while Fig. 2 shows the contrasting trends in dependency on energy imports for the two countries.====A number of business leaders and analysts have expressed concerns about the effect of the energy price gap with the US on the international competitiveness of European firms, raising the possibility that they will either shut down, or move to the US in order to take advantage of lower energy costs. For example, the International Energy Agency suggests that the energy price gap with the US will hurt Europe’s competitiveness for “at least 20 years”.==== Likewise, according to the Chief Executive of Eon, Johannes Teyssen: “There is no near-term cure for Europe’s energy price gap with the US … Companies will continue to move overseas as a result.” “The price difference is unnerving some companies and deciding their investments.”==== Predictions of this type follow directly from theories of vertical foreign direct investment (FDI), where international differences in factor endowments influence the pattern of investment and firms locate different stages of the production process according to where the factors used intensively in production are relatively cheap.====In this paper, we investigate whether firms behave in this way using the US energy revolution as a quasi-natural experiment, and rich micro data on the FDI decisions and energy intensity of individual UK manufacturing firms.==== Our results suggest that UK firms have adjusted to the US energy endowment shock at two extensive margins. First, we find that energy intensive UK firms have established new affiliates in the US in response to the endowment-driven energy price gap. We find that this effect is strongest for firms with the most energy intensive manufacturing units. When measuring energy intensity as an average across all UK manufacturing units owned by a firm, there is a much weaker effect on the firm’s decision to invest in the US. These results suggest that it is important to take within-firm differences in energy intensity into account when modelling firm-level FDI decisions in the presence of energy endowment shocks. We find the results are robust to various concerns about omitted variables, measurement issues and pre-existing trends. In a falsification test, we also show that the US energy endowment shock does not explain UK outward FDI into other European countries. These findings support the interpretation of our results as the causal effect of the US energy endowment shock on UK FDI into the US.====Second, we find evidence that the endowment-driven energy price gap between the UK and US has led to the increased closure of energy intensive UK plants. Relative to a control group of multinational firms that are not investing in the US, we find that US investors are more likely to shut their energy intensive UK plants after the energy price gap emerges. This result holds when we control for unobserved firm heterogeneity and is robust to alternative measures of the energy price gap. These findings provide justification for the fear that the growth of US fracking has led to the relocation of energy intensive production from the UK to the US. More generally, the results provide new evidence on the relationship between input costs and the location of manufacturing plants.====This paper contributes to various strands of the existing literature. First, we add to work that investigates whether energy prices are a source of comparative advantage and therefore affect international trade and investment. This literature focuses mostly on industry level trade responses, rather than firm level investment decisions. Arezki et al. (2017) investigate the impact of the US shale gas revolution on the production and trade patterns of US manufacturing industries. They estimate that lower relative natural gas prices led US exports to increase by more than $100 billion for energy intensive manufacturing industries in 2012. Other studies that investigate the effect of energy prices on trade at the industry level include Aldy and Pizer (2015) and Sato and Dechezlepretre (2015). One study on FDI effects is Saussay and Sato (2018). They consider the impact of energy prices on (2-digit) industry level mergers and acquisitions for a panel of 41 countries. We are the first study in this literature to investigate the micro level investment decisions of individual firms that are heterogeneous in their use of energy. This approach is important to understand the mechanisms underlying the industry level responses previously identified. Only a few studies have previously considered the relationship between energy prices and firm-level investment decisions, including Ratti et al. (2011) and Panhans et al. (2017). Due to a lack of disaggregated data on the energy intensity of individual firms or a quasi-experimental setting, these studies base identification of such effects on national variation in energy prices across many countries. Such an approach makes it impossible to rule out other country-time specific confounders as drivers of this correlation.====Second, we add to the more general literature on the determinants of outward FDI. There are several studies that analyse the comparative advantage motive for FDI – namely, that international differences in factor endowments influence the pattern of investment according to the factor intensity of production (e.g. Eaton and Tamura (1994), Yeaple (2003) and Alfaro and Charlton (2009)). We add to this literature by adopting a novel test of the comparative advantage motive: we exploit a quasi-natural experiment in the form of a shock to a single country’s (the US) endowment of an input to production (energy). We then use this to study the effect on the outward FDI behaviour of firms that are heterogeneous in their intensity of use in this factor of production. To the best our knowledge this has not been done before.====Third, we contribute to the literature on the effect of outward investment on the home-country operations of multinational firms. This literature largely focuses on the role of international wage differentials (Braconier and Ekholm, 2000; Head and Ries, 2002; Muendler and Becker, 2010; Harrison and McMillan, 2011; Simpson, 2012), motivated by concerns that multinationals offshore low-wage, labour intensive production to economies with lower labour costs. Developing countries are less likely to be attractive destinations for FDI in capital intensive industries, as they are typically capital scarce. Thus, we add to the literature by examining FDI between developed countries with similar capital-abundancy and labour markets, but with very different relative prices for a different input to production (energy). Energy prices may be an important consideration for the location of capital-intensive firms – which are also usually energy intensive – and thus may provide an alternative motive for offshoring production than international differences in wages. To the best of our knowledge, no previous studies on the effects of outward FDI on the home-country operations of firms have considered this motive.====The rest of this paper proceeds as follows. In section 2 we set out the econometric approach. Section 3 describes our dataset and presents summary statistics. Section 4 gives the results of the analysis.

We assume that a regulator and a representative polluting firm interact in a Stackelberg differential game, and we specifically allow the firm to pollute above the limit, and pay the corresponding fine. A crucial element is how progressive the fine is with respect to the degree of non-compliance. Some of our results contradict the related literature on the control of stock pollutants under full-compliance. In particular, we find that setting standards dependent on the pollution stock (setting quantities) is preferred if fines are sufficiently non-linear; while setting fines dependent on the pollution stock (setting prices) is preferred if fines are linear or almost linear, and specially when the environmental problem is particularly harmful.","Very frequently, emissions released by polluting facilities accumulate overtime and the resulting environmental damages depend on the stock of pollution. Examples include, among others, global warming and wastewater discharges. So far, the literature has offered the modelling of optimal environmental policies in such dynamic contexts under alternative assumptions, for example, in cases of asymmetric information between regulators and polluting sources (see, for example, Hoel and Karp, 2001, and the references cited therein), when firms undertake investment decisions that affect future abatement costs (Biglaiser et al., 1995; Karp and Zhang, 2016), or in non-point pollution problems with heterogeneous sources (Xabadia et al., 2008; Goetz and Xabadia, 2015). However, all these studies acknowledge full compliance.====In this paper, we deal with the possibility that polluting sources deliberately exceed the regulations in stock pollution problems. For example, in the case of pollution limits or standards, this occurs when firms decide to pollute above the limits. This may be the case when the marginal expected costs of violating the standard (or the expected fine for non-compliance) is lower than the marginal abatement cost savings of exceeding it.====An important environmental problem where our analysis can be applied is the pollution of rivers and lakes from industrial saline wastewater discharges. Many point sources are likely to generate highly saline wastewater, including agro-food, petroleum, textile, leather, mining or power industries, see, for example, Lefebvre and Moletta (2006). These discharges are known to adversely affect aquatic life, water potability and agriculture. Most legislations around the world, such as the Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC, the US Clean Water Act 1972, or the Australian legislation, establish measures to prevent the adverse impacts from saline pollution. In practice, restrictions of wastewater discharges are regulated by means of pollution permits that specify maximum allowed levels of salt concentration at each specific point source, depending on the backround level of salt in the river.====An example in point is the regulation of saline pollution of the Hunter River, in Australia.==== The Hunter River contains high levels of salt as a result of run-off and infiltration, weathering of the geological strata, and saline groundwater inflows, but also due to a range of anthropogenic sources, such as mining, land clearing and agriculture. The regulation balances the water quality needs of agricultural users with the discharge needs of mines and power stations. Facilities use permits to discharge their salty water into the river, but only when it contains adequate fresh water to dilute the salt and maintain water quality. Therefore, the scheme balances the amount of salt that industries can directly discharge with the background level of salt in the river. When river flows are low, no discharges are allowed. During periods of high flows, limited discharges can occur; but only if facilities have sufficient salt credits. The scheme is operated by WaterNSW under a service agreement with the NSW Environment Protection Authority (EPA). To ensure compliance with the permits, the program uses a broad range of enforcement mechanisms, including monetary penalties, formal warnings, official cautions, licence conditions, notices, directions, and prosecutions.==== However, these enforcement tools do not ensure full compliance. Indeed, several companies have been alleged by EPA to have breached environmental legislation.====This example illustrates the importance of studying pollution standards and enforcement strategies in stock pollution problems, taking into account the possibility that facilities may decide to exceed the standards. This is our objective in this paper. We specifically model the dynamic interaction between a representative polluting firm and a regulator by means of a differential game played ====. Firm's emissions accumulate overtime, and environmental damages at a given time depend on the pollution stock. To correct for the externality, the regulator sets a pollution standard and a fine for non-compliance overtime, while the firm chooses emissions, which could be, at any time, above the standard. We assume that the firm seeks to maximize discounted profits throughout an infinite time horizon, while the regulator is concerned about social welfare, that is, firm's profits net of environmental damages and the social costs of implementing sanctions.====In our context of non-compliance, it is important to point out that the regulator controls two instruments simultaneously: the pollution standard (==== instrument) and the fine for non-compliance (==== instrument). Put differently, the standard cannot be enforced without a fine. This clearly contrasts with previous literature on the control of stock pollution under full compliance, where the relative merits of either a standard or a tax are analyzed. There, either a standard is imposed, and firms are assumed to pollute exactly what they are commanded without paying anything; or a tax per unit of pollution is imposed, and firms decide (and pay for) all pollution discharges. Importantly, while our fine is clearly a price instrument, however, it should not be exactly referred to as a tax, since it only applies for pollution levels in excess of the standard. The firm will not pay any amount as long as it matches the standard; and it will only pay for discharges in excess of the standard.====Our analysis considers subgame-perfect and hence time-consistent regulatory policies which, in consequence, are credible policies. Interestingly, the optimal standard becomes harsher as long as the environmental problem worsens overtime, while the optimal fine becomes larger. Thus, both the standard and the fine work as complementary instruments for pollution control, and become harsher (softer) as long as the pollution stock increases (decreases).====From this benchmark scenario where the regulator can control both the standard and the fine overtime (scenario ====), we then move to analyze other more restrictive, although probably more realistic, situations. One possibility is that the regulator sets the emissions standard overtime, while the fine is an exogenous constant. This is our scenario ==== (or ==== scenario). An alternative situation occurs when the regulator only sets the fine, while the emissions standard is an exogenous constant (scenario ====, or ==== scenario).====In these two scenarios ==== and ====, we find that the respective control variables evolve in a similar fashion as in the benchmark case ==== described above. That is, the standard decreases as the pollution stock increases (in scenario ====), while the fine for non-compliance increases as the pollution stock increases (in scenario ====). Interestingly, scenario ==== approaches scenario ====, as long as the progressive part of the fine for non-compliance is more important, while the performance of scenario ==== is much less dependent on this progressive term.====A relevant research question in all this constrained analysis is ==== Should we pick scenario ==== or scenario ====? Put differently, should the regulation be based on quantities or on prices? In a static context of asymmetric information, the seminal paper by Weitzman (1974) shows that regulating through quantities is preferred as long as marginal environmental damages are steeper than marginal abatement costs. Later on, Hoel and Karp (2001) extend this analysis to stock pollution problems, showing that a steeper marginal environmental damage, a lower decay rate or a higher discount factor (all of them suggesting that the environmental problem worsens) favor the use of quantities. The first effect matches the result by Weitzman (1974), while the other two are specific of stock pollution problems.====The question here is whether we can make a similar claim when non-compliance is an issue. Importantly, our focus is different: we concentrate on the effects of non-compliance, while at the same time we assume symmetric information between the regulator and the firm.==== This implies perfect monitoring, which helps us to concentrate on the effects of the penalties for non-compliance.====An idiosyncratic aspect in our study is the specific structure of the fine for non-compliance. For tractability reasons, we consider a linear-quadratic shape, where the regulator can only control the linear part.==== There is, however, an additional quadratic component that measures the progressivity of the fine, which is crucial in the performance of all scenarios, specially in scenario ====. As long as the quadratic component of the fine increases, scenario ==== becomes more attractive than scenario ====. The reason is that the standard becomes more effective in affecting pollution, since the marginal fine depends on the standard, and this dependence increases with the progressivity of the fine.====Our results suggest that controlling through fines (prices) is preferred under linear enforcement, while controlling through standards (quantities) is preferred under progressive enforcement (and the more progressive the fine, the more in favor of standards). These results are robust to different specifications of the most relevant parameters of the problem, namely environmental damages, the discount rate, or the degree of assimilative capacity of the environment. When the fine is sufficiently progressive, the prevalence of quantities (scenario ====) is preserved, regardless of the specific parameters describing the environmental problem. However, as long as the fine is not that progressive, larger environmental damages, lower discount rates or lower decay rates favor the use of prices (scenario ====). Again, scenario ==== is not relevant for controlling emissions when the fine is linear or not sufficiently progressive, and therefore scenario ==== gains importance in controlling harmful situations.====Hence, our different focus results in a different conclusion. As pointed out above, Hoel and Karp (2001) consider asymmetric information while they acknowledge full compliance, and they conclude that quantities are preferred under larger environmental damages, lower discount rates or lower decay rates. In our context, however, non-compliance is an issue and information problems are absent, and we find the prevalence for prices in the cases where the environmental problem is harmful (as long as fines are not very progresive in the amount of the violation).====Besides scenarios ==== and ====, a second set of restrictions entails situations where agents partially ignore the pollution stock. On the one hand, we assume that the regulator can control the two instruments (standard and fine), but he/she is restricted to constant values of the standard and the fine. These constraints may obey practical reasons dealing with simplicity of the regulation, for example. However, a more simplistic implementation comes at the cost of lower credibility, since these policies are no longer time-consistent. On the other hand, we also consider the case where the firm behaves myopically, not acknowledging that higher pollution will induce a higher fine and a lower standard. In the myopic case, policies are credible and the regulator needs to rely on harsher fine and standard. Both cases result in higher long-run pollution stock and lower social welfare.====Up to our knowledge, this is the first theoretical study of this kind. As stated before, several papers analyze optimal regulations in dynamic settings, but they do so by assuming perfect compliance.==== Also, the vast majority of existing works about the relationship between regulatory stringency and compliance assumes static contexts, and therefore neglects the possibility that pollution may accumulate overtime, see, for example, Downing and Watson (1974), Harford (1978), Jones and Scotchmer (1990), Keeler (1995), or Arguedas (2008, 2013), among others. There is also a relevant literature on optimal dynamic enforcement, for example, Harrington (1988), Harford and Harrington (1991), Raymond (1999), Friesen (2003), or Zhang and Xu (2016), but these studies assume exogenous standards. Up to our knowledge, the only exception that studies optimal standard setting in dynamic contexts allowing for non-compliance is Arguedas et al., 2017, but restricted to flow pollution contexts.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present the model. In Section 3, we analyze the characteristics of the benchmark policy where the regulator can control for both the pollution standard and the fine (scenario ====). In Section 4, we extensively compare this scenario with two restrictive situations where the regulator can only control for the standard being the fine exogenous (scenario ====), or the fine, being the standard exogenous (scenario ====). In Section 5, we present other restrictive cases where, for several reasons, decision agents may partially ignore the pollution stock. We conclude in Section 6.

In such cases, Kaldor-Hicks cost-benefit analysis seeks ==== Pareto-improvements by showing the hypothetical potential for the winners to compensate the losers via lump-sum transfers. In their absence, once a costly climate policy is actually implemented, it unleashes distortions and general-equilibrium effects rendering unclear whether Kaldor-Hicks potential improvements lead to ","Climate change is an externality – the Stern Review (2007) calls it the greatest market failure and largest externality in history. What is more, both the externality and the measures needed to address it are, necessarily, intergenerational in nature. After all, greenhouse gases are long-lived and their effects linger, long after they appear. Similarly, costly measures adopted today may generate benefits far into the future, well beyond the lifespan of the generations funding them. As such, any response towards combating climate change will require strong political action across generations. By the same token, however, any policy response will likely create intergenerational winners and losers and, in turn, raise thorny questions about intergenerational equity and its trade-off with efficiency. Pearson (2011) phrases it bluntly: “Should we sacrifice our use of cheap fossil fuel energy today so that generations yet unborn, who presumably will be richer than we are, can avoid adjusting to a warmer world?” Even if we could agree the answer is yes, how should the near-term costs of clean-up be allocated across generations in a fair and efficient manner? For if it is not perceived to be fair, why would different generations participate in this cross-generational initiative? There are other concerns of a more practical nature. Specifically, “there is no political institution or mechanism through which the present generation can securely compensate […future] generations for the consequences of global warming […and symmetrically,] there is no obvious way for future generations […] to compensate us for our sacrifices if we take expensive greenhouse abatement measures today.” (Pearson, 2011, pp. 23) Is it possible to navigate our way around these concerns?====In this paper, our goal is to produce a simple model capturing intergenerational conflict of the type alluded to above. In the main body of the paper, we study a business-as-usual world (henceforth, “BAU”), a small, open, overlapping-generations economy in which a single production factor, labor, causes emissions. (Later in the paper, we study using numerical methods, a closed economy with endogenous factor prices and include capital as an input as well.) There is no within-generation heterogeneity and agents are not altruistic.==== Unabated emissions reduce future productivity (an intergenerational externality) but has no direct effect on utility. There exists an abatement technology, not used in the BAU world, that can reduce emissions at some cost that is increasing and convex in the intensity of the abatement. As such, over time, the BAU economy gets increasingly polluted, consumption falls, and generational welfare levels decline.====The government contemplates abatement action aimed at correcting the underlying externality. To that end, it can issue debt to finance its abatement activities and may impose a distortionary labor tax to service that debt. Since emissions linger for generations, benefits from the government's clean-up effort take time to ramp up thereby creating winners and losers across cohorts. The government is committed to a policy package that abates a constant fraction, ====, of emissions funded by an associated debt-tax policy which is constrained by an intergenerational Pareto criterion: no generation ==== policy is allowed to be worse off compared to the BAU world.==== Under such a policy, we show pollution levels start to decline, generating downstream welfare gains. Some of these gains are taxed – without hurting anyone, in a Pareto sense – to help pay off the debt. Along the transition, every generation faces less pollution, consumes more and is happier than if life had continued in the BAU world.====The imposition of a generation-by-generation Pareto criterion is deliberate and instructive.==== It allows us to employ insights from overlapping-generation models of deficit financing – see Bovenberg and Heijdra (1998) and more recently, Andersen and Bhattacharya (2019) – to address Pearson (2011) concern about there being “no obvious way” by which generations can share clean-up costs: we allow for inter-generational compensation for investments in environment-friendly policies via debt financing. The general logic is to use debt to pay for the abatement policy and repay the debt by imposing taxes on future generations. Because abatement causes productivity to improve in the future, it is possible to produce more output in every future period. The government can tax some of that gain to help repay the debt even as it offers each future generation no less utility, possibly a bit more consumption. By insisting government policies meet the generational Pareto criterion, we are, in effect, arguing that Pearson's other concern – lack of a political institution – is not that critical: after all, policies that satisfy the Pareto criterion are less likely to be blocked as they make their way through modern democratic processes.====Standard welfare economics, recently emphasized by Foley (2007) and Heal (2009), suggests that in the presence of a huge uninternalized externality such as climate change, the BAU scenario cannot be Pareto efficient and hence action to correct the externality must, ====, offer a Pareto improvement: “the gains must outweigh the costs so that the gainers could compensate the losers and still gain. We can all come out ahead — whether we actually do is a matter of institutional design.” (Heal, 2009) This remark from Heal (2009) captures the essence of the standard approach to check whether a proposed policy intervention is potentially desirable: use the Kaldor-Hicks compensation criterion and verify if it generates an efficiency gain – a ==== potential for a government to use ==== taxes on the winners and use the proceeds to compensate the losers (leaving both as happy as before the policy introduction).====However, in the absence of nondistorting taxes, as numerous welfare economists have noted and Nishiyama and Smetters (2007) observe, “…constructing a policy that is ==== Pareto improving from a policy that improves Hicksian efficiency is a tougher task.” [emphasis ours] How so? First, distortionary taxes influence production decisions with feedback effects on both individual and government budgets, the environment, and other variables influencing welfare. Second, an actual policy, ====, would release its own dynamics, produce general-equilibrium gains and losses spread across generations, and those would all have to be properly accounted for if the policy upon implementation is to be deemed genuinely Pareto-improving, generation by generation. We take on this “tougher task” using analytical means.====What makes the analysis challenging is that the very act of actually compensating generations releases its own dynamics. For sure, investments in environment-friendly policies via debt financing allow future generations to reap gains, but they also have to participate, via tax payments and additional debt purchase, in the servicing of the outstanding debt. Debt will be growing at the gross rate of interest, ==== > 1; hence, it is not trivial whether the downstream gains from a better environment can cover the aforediscussed compensation (including interest) ==== prevent the debt from growing without bound. In sum, ==== major contribution of this paper is demonstrating existence of a ==== of ==== (abatement policies) financed by distorting taxes, which, once implemented, induce a path of Pareto-improvements over the BAU and keep the associated path of debt well-behaved. It bears emphasis here, unlike many papers in this line of work, we are not restricting the analysis to ==== ≈ 0 for if ==== ≈ 0 is considered, a marginal increase in ==== would produce a first order benefit in terms of (taxable) future productivity gains and only a second order effect on debt via the effect on interest rates – in that case, it would not be surprising gains in future taxes could gradually repay the debt. In our case, more ambitious abatement policies are more costly and have both a first ==== second order effect on debt, which means it is no longer clear whether future taxes arising from the taxing of the first order productivity gains are enough to eventually pay off the debt.====There is another important dimension in which we advance the literature. As Karp and Rezai, 2014a, Karp and Rezai, 2014b argue, a convergent conclusion from the literature emanating from the Stern Review (2007) and the IAMs – summarized in Heal (2009) – is that current generations must sacrifice consumption in order to combat climate change.==== This conclusion is often blamed as the reason why climate negotiations have proven to be a non-starter.==== We take on the challenge of studying policies that not only satisfy the generational Pareto criterion in utility terms, but also ensure that no generation has to sacrifice consumption along the way. Our results connect up with the broader literature on sustainability – Neumayer (2007), Sterner and Persson (2008) and Heal (2009) – that recognizes limited substitutability between a loss to environmental capital (due to global warming) and gains to incomes/consumption and argues for the need to maintain at least a minimum critical level of the former. In a way, requiring that consumption not decline ties our hands substantially; it precludes the possibility of exploiting the substitutability of the environment and consumption to leave generations as happy as in the BAU.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the related literature while Section 3 lays bare our contribution relative to the Kaldor-Hicks criterion. Section 4 describes the model economy with an exogenously-specified interest rate, endogenous labor-leisure choice and the BAU environment, and exposes the inefficiency arising from the environment externality. Section 5 studies a constant environmental policy under an intergenerational Pareto criterion and the associated implementation hurdles for the tractable case of quasi-linear preferences.

Using plant-level data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), I examine an unexpected shift in the use of traditional enforcement by environmental regulators in Florida, showing that all of the state's plants decreased emissions and improved compliance following an increase in penalties for those with Priority Violations. The largest improvements were observed among plants with the highest expected costs of compliance, which is consistent with the theory of dynamic enforcement. These results are robust to the use of control plants from nearby southern states, as well as control plants selected via a matching algorithm. The paper's findings (1) provide quasi-experimental evidence on the effectiveness of traditional enforcement actions, and (2) suggest that dynamic incentives may matter for plant compliance decisions.","The economic theory of enforcement and criminal punishment is well known: in order to deter crime, the expected punishment for a crime must exceed its expected benefit (Becker, 1968). However, there is a significant challenge in designing policies that minimize the sum of criminal and enforcement costs. “Dynamic enforcement,” where penalties and other enforcement actions are based on previous noncompliance, is one policy that can help reduce these costs. In the general economics literature, dynamic enforcement, state-dependent enforcement, graduated punishments, and otherwise similar practices have been shown to achieve cost minimization even when monitoring is imperfect or penalties are restricted (Ostrom, 1990; Polinsky and Rubinfeld, 1991; Dixit, 2009).====In environmental economics, dynamic enforcement is consequential because, despite low penalties for first-time offenders, regulators can deter noncompliance through the threat of increased penalties and monitoring for repeat offenders. This means that a plant must consider the current penalty for a violation, as well as the increased cost for any future violations. The effect is bolstered if there are associated reputational costs (Hamilton, 1995; Konar and Cohen, 2001). Although the combination of these factors makes dynamic enforcement theoretically appealing, it poses significant challenges in terms of empirically estimating the effectiveness of traditional enforcement measures. These challenges include the potential for omitted variable bias, reverse causality, and the improper specification of firms’ regulatory perceptions (List, 2007; Gray and Shimshack, 2011; Shimshack, 2014).====Currently there is only limited empirical evidence on the effect of traditional enforcement actions within a dynamic enforcement setting (Helland, 1998; Eckert, 2004; Shinkuma and Managi, 2012; Blundell et al., 2018). This study employs a unique quasi-experiment with detailed panel data on emissions, regulatory activity, and compliance in order to evaluate the response of manufacturing plants in the United States to the use of traditional enforcement, in a dynamic setting. This experiment follows the federal EPA's review of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) in 2012. The EPA found that penalties issued previously by the Florida DEP for “High-Priority Violations” were inadequate. Following the review, there was a substantial increase in penalties for priority plants in Florida, with little change in the enforcement for other plants. The limitation of a penalty increase for priority plants, without changing the criteria for classification, allows for clean identification of the effects of traditional enforcement actions on plant behavior.====Therefore, this study makes two contributions to the literature on enforcement. First, I use quasi-experimental variation to quantify the extent to which an increase in penalties improves compliance and other environmental outcomes. Second, I provide empirical evidence that firms’ responses from this quasi-experiment are consistent with the theory of dynamic enforcement, indicating that dynamic incentives may matter for the design of enforcement policy.====Using a difference-in-differences approach, I find that all Florida plants had an increased rate of compliance following the 2012 review. These effects range from 0.15% to 43.1% with the largest estimated effects for plants that were a priority as well as plants that were noncompliant but not classified as a priority during the pre-treatment period. In addition, I examine the mechanisms behind the improved compliance of Florida plants. I find that the emission of harmful pollutants from all Florida plants decreased roughly 31% and evaluation failures by Florida plants with a history of noncompliance decreased by 2.1%. I show that these results are consistent with the underlying theory of dynamic enforcement by using a Difference-in-Difference-in-Difference framework. Florida plants with the highest expected costs of compliance had the largest improvements in compliance and other environmental outcomes.====These findings are robust and not based on sample selection. In particular, corresponding results are found using control plants from Alabama, South Carolina, and Georgia, as well as with control plants selected by subindustry and plant characteristics via a matching algorithm. Using supplementary data, it is evident that the improvements in Florida plant compliance continued into 2017. Furthermore, I find that the changes in compliance found in Florida cannot be explained by macroeconomic shocks. Overall, these findings indicate that plant responses to increased enforcement are consistent with the theory of dynamic enforcement, but do not rule out other possible theories.====This study's findings should extend to other situations, including environmental settings, where dynamic enforcement has been documented. This includes enforcement of the Clean Water Act (Shimshack and Ward, 2008; Earnhart, 2004), regulations related to petroleum storage (Eckert, 2004), waste disposal (Stafford, 2002; Shinkuma and Managi, 2012), and oil spills.==== Non-environmental situations include tax compliance and worker safety (Landsberger and Meilijson, 1982; Ko et al., 2010). Evans (2016) also finds significant effects with non-traditional enforcement via a watch list, in conjunction with the dynamic enforcement of the Clean Air Act (CAA).",When threats become credible: A natural experiment of environmental enforcement from Florida,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009506961830740X,30 December 2019,2019,Research Article,254.0

There are few rigorous empirical estimates regarding the efficacy of these policies, particularly for outcomes such as transit ridership or traffic flow, which are of key policy relevance. Exploiting features of the roll out of SFpark, a smart-parking program for the city of San Francisco, we are able to estimate its effect upon public transit usage and traffic flow. Using a difference-in-difference strategy and a rich micro data-set on transit bus ridership along with data from SFpark, we find that SFpark led to a significant increase in bus ridership and a reduction in traffic flow. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that the economic benefits resulting from avoided pollution and reduced congestion consequent to SFpark is larger than the approximate nominal costs of the program. Overall, our results suggest that smart-parking programs can help mitigate many traffic-related externalities, yielding significant economic benefits.","Parking is a growing problem in U.S. cities due to the increasing growth in population and automobiles, reflecting the fundamental fact that cars remain parked about 95% of the time (Shoup (1997b); Marsden (2006); Shoup (2006)). Parking is a key intermediate good in the modern economy, since every automobile trip concludes with it (Inci, 2015). In view of the significant variations in the demand for parking along both space (location) and time dimensions, economic principles, articulated as long ago as 1953 by Vickrey, indicate that some form of spatio-temporally varying pricing is required to attain efficiency. Yet, parking worldwide is either free or administered via a combination of policies based very loosely, at best, upon average demand and spatio-temporal administrative restrictions (including time enforcement). These policies are not only inefficient but also create additional externalities, in particular leading to driving purely for finding parking (“cruising”). Thus, inefficient parking policies can contribute to congestion via cruising (extensively documented in Shoup (2011)), adding to the already significant congestion burden in cities.====Excess demand for parking is widely acknowledged to be a contributing factor to increased congestion in urban areas. Cities experiencing rapid increases in automobile usage have focused largely on policies aimed at reducing entry into the most congested areas by adopting measures such as road tolls or congestion pricing, where motorists entering the central business district pay a fee during peak hours (Albert and Mahalel (2006); Hess (2001); Hamre and Buehler (2014); Fosgerau and de Palma (2013); Verhoef et al. (1995); Gibson and Carnovale (2015)). These charges are meant to rationalize traffic entering the city center. Nonetheless, once traffic enters the designated central region of a city, congestion within the region is strongly influenced by many aspects of parking (van Ommeren et al. (2012); van Ommeren et al. (2011)), which are spatio-temporally heterogeneous in ways difficult to account for easily by a congestion charge. Thus, even with a congestion charge, the problem of optimizing on-street parking remains.====In view of recent technological improvements, and associated cost reductions in metering of parking spaces, managing parking more efficiently at a finer temporal scale via so-called “smart-parking” has become more popular, and constitutes a market-based way of optimizing on-street parking. Programs of this nature are already in effect in cities as diverse as Seattle, San Francisco and Beijing and in planning or discussion phases in others. The primary goal of these programs is to use parking spaces more efficiently by appropriately encouraging turnover, leading to better parking availability and reduced cruising. These programs involve a variety of changes to parking policies, including differentially pricing parking based on occupancy along with other measures intended broadly to enhance parking efficiency.====It is important to note that parking policies are likely to affect not only congestion via cruising but, similar to congestion-related policies, also lead to altered trade-offs between public transit and private automobile (“auto”) usage. This aspect assumes importance in view of parking policies having been repeatedly cited as strong motivators for driving in travel surveys (SFMTA (2015)). To illustrate, a survey from 2005 of travelers in the San Francisco Bay area found that if parking were free, only 5% of respondents would take the bus and 75% would drive alone (SFMTA, 2014b). However, if parking were priced, then as many as 43% of respondents would take the bus and only 37% would choose to drive alone. Consequently, there may well be channels for welfare enhancement beyond those directly envisaged by parking management policies. While estimating the effects of changes in aggregate travel patterns and mode by measuring the reduction in vehicular usage is an active area of research for congestion charges (e.g., Gibson and Carnovale (2015)), little is known regarding how changes in parking management affect travel mode at the city-block level, which is the level at which parking management rules vary.====As noted most recently in Inci (2015), markets for parking are important, complex and understudied, with a particular lack of empirical studies relating parking policies to key outcomes of importance for urban quality of life: congestion and pollution. Our study is an attempt to fill precisely this gap. In this study, we investigate the effects of the SFpark program, a smart-parking program in San Francisco administered by the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Authority (SFMTA). The explicit goal of SFpark was to significantly enhance the efficiency of parking management using both demand responsive pricing and other non-price-related measures, with the aim of reducing cruising for parking. We use the fact that the SFMTA made no changes to bus schedules consequent to (or in anticipation of) SFpark. In addition, while parking price changes were exogenous to individual travelers, they were endogenous at the aggregate level: price changes, in direction and magnitude, occurred every rate adjustment period (of approximately 8 weeks) depending upon the previous period's occupancy. Thus, the magnitude and direction of price change at each block could not have been known a priori by any individual traveler, ruling out any rational way of anticipating the effects of the program.====We focus on two aspects of the relationship between parking and urban transportation that have been discussed in largely disparate literatures: transit usage and traffic flow. SFpark could potentially affect the travel mode split at the parking block level by encouraging either automobile use, if the effect of better availability of parking slots due to increased parking turnover is dominant, or an increase in transit ridership if effects other than this are dominant. We are also interested in the effects on traffic flow in view of the explicit goal of SFpark to reduce congestion and improve traffic flow. While prior studies (e.g., Millard-Ball et al. (2014); Chatman and Manville (2014)) have shown that SFpark is associated with decreases in one aspect of congestion, cruising for parking, there has been no similarly rigorous evaluation regarding the effects upon overall traffic flow. We use data from the SFpark pilot evaluation project (“SFpark pilot project”) for on-street parking, which includes hourly data on parking occupancy, metered rates and measures of daily traffic flow, between July 2011 and July 2013. We supplement these data with a rich, detailed panel data set on the SFMTA's Muni transit bus system in San Francisco that includes information on bus ridership at a given time, date, and bus stop for all bus lines. Using these data, along with urban U.S. estimates for pollution and San Francisco-specific figures for congestion costs, we quantify the effects on transit usage of the implementation of SFpark and assess the environmental and economic effects of the program.====Our findings shed light on several aspects of urban transport that relate to parking. First, we find that SFpark led to an increase in bus ridership of about 21 passengers per census block, date, and time-band==== (representing 11% of average bus ridership), suggesting that mode choice in the aggregate is responsive to parking policies. This is a result that is commonly reported in stated-preference studies, but has not been quantified at the scale of census blocks using very detailed public transit ridership data.==== Second, SFpark led to reduced daily traffic flow, with daily average lane occupancy, our first measure of traffic flow, falling by a substantial 5 percentage points (representing a 29% reduction in the daily average lane occupancy), while a second measure of traffic flow, daily average vehicular count, falls by 4 vehicles (although not significant). We also observe some variation in the effects of SFpark across the two-year period of the program, indicating some degree of reoptimization as travelers learn about the effects of the program and adapt to it. Using San Francisco-specific estimates of avoided pollution and travel patterns, we find that our estimates translate to economic benefits of at least $35 million over the two-year duration of the pilot program, a sizable figure for a policy that envisaged rather moderate changes in parking policies.====Our study contributes to the literature in several different ways: it provides the first well-identified estimate of the changes in transit usage attributable to parking management using very detailed transit micro-data, and contributes to the sparse empirical literature regarding the effects of pricing parking (van Ommeren et al. (2011); Millard-Ball et al. (2014), Millard-Ball et al. (2013); Pierce and Shoup (2013a); Pierce and Shoup (2013b); SFMTA (2014b); Chatman and Manville (2014)); it sheds light on two distinct aspects of the effects of SFpark not previously explored, thereby providing a complementary perspective to previous studies of SFpark (e.g., Millard-Ball et al. (2014)); and complements the related theoretical literature examining the effects of parking upon congestion (Arnott and Inci (2006); Arnott and Rowse (2009); Arnott et al. (2015)).====The rest of the paper unfolds as follows: Section 2 contextualizes our questions by relating them to the relevant literature.

As a result, polluting plants in hundreds of counties faced significant new regulatory costs. This paper discusses the selection process by which counties were designated as nonattainment and provides empirical evidence on the impacts of these regulations on employment, establishments and establishment size in exposed ","The Environmental Protection Agency's National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) have been called the most costly environmental regulation implemented in the history of the United States.==== While proponents have cited the health benefits that come from improving air quality, industry groups decry them for the extra production costs they impose on pollution-emitting establishments. Economists have long recognized the importance of these regulations and have devoted considerable research to examining their economic impact. Indeed, a number of prominent papers have studied policy-induced changes in outcomes ranging from health benefits (Isen et al., 2017) to labor market transition costs (Walker, 2013) to impacts on productivity (Greenstone et al., 2012). Employment has been a primary outcome of interest (Greenstone, 2002; Kahn and Mansur, 2013) and more recently economists have explored the effects on market structure (Ryan, 2012). All of these papers have examined the original implementation of the NAAQS that began in the 1970's and a revision of the standards that occurred in 1990.====The more recent 2004 expansion of the NAAQS has received far less attention by researchers.==== This despite the fact that nearly ==== as many counties entered into nonattainment status in 2004 than entered during the 1990 expansion. Given the size of the recent expansion and the fundamental changes that have taken place to the manufacturing sector and labor markets over the past quarter-century, the 2004 NAAQS expansion represents a chance to reassess our understanding of this key U.S. environmental policy. Evaluating the economic effects of the ozone nonattainment standard is of considerable interest not only to policy makers who are required by law to reevaluate the nonattainment standards every five years, but also to economists seeking to understand the broader economic implications of regulating a key sector of the economy.====A primary motivating factor for this study is that the U.S. manufacturing sector in 2004 was fundamentally different than the manufacturing sector regulated under previous expansions of the Clean Air Act. Just between 1990 and 2004, capital intensity, measured as capital-output ratio, nearly doubled and the large majority of manufacturing industries had become significantly more concentrated (Autor et al., 2017; Grullon et al., 2016). Despite steady increases in overall manufacturing output, the number of workers in the sector had declined by over 20% and both worker turnover and job reallocation saw noticeable downturns (Haltiwanger et al., 2012).====While the state of the manufacturing sector had changed considerably by 2004, the basic framework of the nonattainment standards and the types of costs they imposed on manufacturers had not. When a county enters nonattainment, polluting plants located in that county are forced to comply with a variety of new regulations. Existing plants are required to install “reasonably available control technology” (RACT) as defined by the EPA and new emission sources are required to achieve “lowest available emission rate” on top of the RACT requirement. Any new emissions source, whether it be a newly constructed plant or an expanding plant, also must undergo a lengthy “New Source Review” process and is required to obtain offsets for every new ton of emissions it produces. The upshot of these regulations is that they increase entry and investment costs for firms in polluting industries (Becker and Henderson, 2000; Becker, 2005).====This paper attempts to gain insights into how these regulatory costs affected employment levels, number of establishments and establishment size in newly regulated regions using county-industry data from the County Business Patterns and the National Emissions Inventory. Results from a matched difference-in-difference specification suggest that immediately following the regulation, employment in county-industries that entered into nonattainment actually shrank less relative to employment in the constructed counterfactual. This short-term employment effect is shown to dissipate and ten years following the regulation the effect is close to zero and statistically insignificant. However, the number of establishments permanently decreased by around 6% and establishment size increased by around 8%. The employment finding sheds light on the labor demand effects of the regulation and the establishment and establishment-size results are consistent with previous research finding changes to market structure following the ozone nonattainment standards (Ryan, 2012).====Past theoretical work has put forth various mechanisms through which environmental regulations may affect labor demand and market structure. Consider labor demand: to comply with environmental regulations plants may hire new workers to install and maintain their new pollution abating capital and to monitor their now altered production process. Assuming no change in production levels, this would result in firms demanding additional labor (Morgenstern et al., 2002; Greenstone et al., 2012). However, as costs go up, plants may also choose to downsize or relocate production to less regulated regions, thus reducing the number of workers in the regulated region. With respect to market structure, increases in fixed costs can result in fewer new firms entering the market and increased market power for incumbent firms in industries that are already highly concentrated.==== As a result, regulation can favor large, incumbent firms and reduce market competition due to the declining number of new firms (List et al., 2003). Because of the theoretical ambiguity of the employment effect and the limited research on market concentration indicators such as number of plants and plant size, empirical work informing the direction and magnitude of these effects is particularly informative (see Heyes (2009) for a literature review on regulation and competition). Past research has shown the employment and market concentration effects of the policy are of first order importance to understanding the net benefits of the policy. For example, Walker (2013) finds that workers faced $5.4 billion of transition costs and Ryan (2012) finds that product market surplus declined by as much as $3.2 billion in the cement industry alone as a result of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments.====However, the empirical task of estimating the impact of nonattainment standards is complicated by a variety of selection concerns which, even in the economics literature, are not always explicitly discussed.==== Section 2 provides a detailed description of this selection process, describing how states negotiate with the EPA to determine which counties will enter nonattainment status. Exceeding the pollution threshold is a key criteria but it is neither a necessary or sufficient condition for entering nonattainment status. In addition to the county's pollution readings, the final determination is, among other things, based on whether its emissions contribute to nearby counties' ability to meet air quality thresholds and, crucially for identification purposes, trends in emissions of the county's stationary sources.====Given this selection process, it is not surprising that summary statistics display substantial differences between industries in nonattainment counties and industries in attainment counties. In short, counties switching to nonattainment not only have more employment, establishments and NO==== emissions, but they are also less likely to be experiencing reductions in industrial activity prior to the implementation of the regulations. Because selection is based on observations’ trends, identification strategies that assume regulated and unregulated regions have common trends will provide biased treatment effects. Similar problems will arise comparing border counties when treated counties are specifically selected based on their economic activity and polluting activity rather than by exogenous state borders. As such, the empirical strategy used to identify the effect of nonattainment status should directly control for the selection process that ensures that polluting industries in counties entering into nonattainment will be different both from national industry trends and different than the overall manufacturing trend in the county.====To account for concerns over selection into nonattainment status, this paper uses a nearest-neighbor propensity score matching technique developed by Heckman et al. (1997) and Heckman et al. (1998) and used more recently in the environmental literature by Fowlie et al. (2012), Banzhaf and Walsh (2008), Gray et al. (2014) and Petrick and Wagner (2014) among others. For every “dirty” county-industry that enters into nonattainment status in 2004, I construct a counterfactual of ==== “nearest-neighbor” county-industries based on a rich set of pre-treatment characteristics. A strict overlap condition is imposed whereby, for each county-industry entering nonattainment, only observations in the same industry and Census division are included in its pool of potential controls. From this pool, the counterfactual(s) is selected based on pre-treatment manufacturing activity levels (employment size), pre-treatment manufacturing activity trends and pre-treatment NO==== emissions levels. Matching on these pre-treatment characteristics, particularly the pre-treatment trends, helps overcomes concerns that selection into the treatment is endogenous.====A few cautionary notes bear mention when interpreting the results. First, neither the employment, establishment or plant size results represent a direct pecuniary measure of the cost of regulation. They are important economic outcomes with political economy and welfare implications but converting these effects into a specific dollar cost requires assumptions that are beyond the scope of this paper. This is particularly relevant given that the paper does not attempt to explicitly model changes in market power for firms in the regulated industries. Second, these results do not speak to the impacts of the regulations on firms’ profits or productivity. Indeed, as suggested by Greenstone et al. (2012), hiring additional workers to comply with regulation will in fact lower plant productivity. Finally, the number of establishments and establishment size are only proxies for market structure. Products vary in the extent to which they can be transported and in the extent to which they can be substituted. While the estimated treatment effects are symptomatic of changes in market structure, more information and modeling are needed to understand changes in market power.====Despite these caveats, the finding of a temporary employment increase in nonattainment counties relative to similar attainment counties suggests that, at least in the medium-run, concerns over regulation-induced job loss were overstated. Of greater concern are the establishment and plant size results which may suggest a change in market structure following the regulations. While there are many important questions that remain, this study adds new evidence of how the ozone nonattainment standards specifically, and environmental regulations more generally, are likely to shape today's manufacturing sector.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows.

Leveraging the randomization created by Beijing's vehicle license plate lottery, we estimate the effects of the policy on travel behavior. We find that the policy reduces the total stock of cars in Beijing by 14%. It also causes large reductions in vehicle distance traveled, morning rush hour driving, and evening rush hour driving.","Cars are a major contributor to some of the most important environmental issues today: air pollution, congestion, and climate change. Much of the future growth in cars is expected to occur in the developing world. Demand for petroleum in non-OECD countries has passed that of OECD nations, and is expected to grow a further 60% by 2030 (EIA, 2015).====Despite the large negative externalities associated with cars, policy makers have struggled to formulate an effective response. Road space rationing, where cars with selected license plates are fined if they drive on certain days during peak congestion hours, has been deployed in large cities such as México City, Santiago, and São Paulo. Davis (2008) concludes that driving restrictions have little effect on vehicle use, air pollution, and congestion in México City. Wang et al. (2013) find that almost half of drivers evaded Beijing's vehicle use restrictions. Even so, Viard and Fu (2015) find that the Beijing vehicle use restrictions result in some air quality improvements, and Zhong et al. (2017) find that they reduce ambulance calls and reports of heart-related symptoms. Overall, these studies highlight a key problem with road space rationing: evasion of these policies is widespread, diminishing their effectiveness.====In this paper, we study a second type of policy response that an increasing number of cities are undertaking: restrictions on vehicle ownership. In cities like Singapore, Beijing, and Shanghai, potential car buyers cannot freely add cars to their households, but must first bid in an auction or win a lottery for the right to purchase a car. As of 2017, eight Chinese cities with a combined population of more than 165 million restrict vehicle ownership. Many additional cities are considering similar policies (Yang et al., 2014). Vehicle ownership restrictions may be more effective than road space rationing because evasion is more difficult: one would have to purchase a car with a license plate from another area and be subject to the constant threat of fines. However, fines have not deterred those evading road space rationing, and no prior study has examined whether vehicle ownership restrictions are actually effective.====We perform the first evaluation of the effectiveness of vehicle ownership restrictions at reducing vehicle ownership and vehicle use. Our setting is the Beijing vehicle license plate lottery, which began in 2011 and reduced new car sales by roughly three-fourths in its first year compared to the previous year. The lottery includes a randomized drawing that allows us to overcome the problems of confounders that usually apply to analysis of car ownership. Our paper sheds light on vehicle policies in China, one of the most important car markets and the top contributor worldwide to greenhouse gas emissions. In contrast to the mixed performance of road space rationing, we find unambiguous effects of vehicle ownership restrictions: they sharply cut car ownership and the amount of driving.====A major hurdle to analyzing ownership restrictions is that vehicle ownership is surely endogenous; many unobserved characteristics influence both car ownership and travel behavior.==== Unobserved individual and household characteristics are likely to be a particularly salient problem when investigating the relationship between vehicle ownership and travel behavior. For example, because cars are often used for commuting, unobserved job opportunities or preferences over modes of transportation may bias attempts to compare households based on the number of cars they own. However, in the Beijing lottery, conditional upon entering, winning the lottery is randomly assigned and is therefore exogenous to all other characteristics of the household. As a result, we can evaluate the effects of the policy by comparing car ownership and travel behavior across winners and losers. Moreover, lottery status represents a natural instrumental variable (IV) for vehicle ownership, allowing us to estimate the effects of vehicle ownership on travel behavior.====We first show that lottery outcomes are uncorrelated with determinants of travel behavior, supporting the validity of the empirical strategy. While we cannot directly compare unobservable individual-level attributes, we confirm that observable household and individual attributes that should not be affected by the lottery, such as gender and birth year, are statistically indistinguishable across lottery winners and losers. Furthermore, winning the lottery is a strong predictor of car ownership, reducing concerns about weak instruments bias.====Then, we estimate the reduced-form effects of winning the lottery on vehicle ownership and travel. On average, winning the lottery increases the probability that a household has at least one car by 42 percentage points. Winning the lottery more than doubles total distance driven and the probability that the individual drives during the morning or evening rush hours.====In addition to the reduced-form effects of winning the lottery on car ownership and travel behavior, we estimate the effects of car ownership on travel behavior. This analysis provides insight into the potential effects on travel behavior of other policies that may affect ownership. To address the endogeneity of ownership, we use the lottery outcome to instrument for the number of vehicles owned by the households. Consistent with the reduced-form estimates, we find that reducing the number of household cars sharply cuts kilometers traveled–both overall and during rush hour times.====Finally, we use the reduced-form results to estimate the aggregate effects of the lottery on vehicle ownership and travel. These should be considered partial equilibrium estimates, in that they hold fixed congestion levels (and other factors that may affect vehicle ownership and use) at the levels observed during the lottery. Between 2011 and 2014, these restrictions decreased the total stock of cars in Beijing by 14%, a large amount.==== Moreover, removing the lottery would increase total VKT in Beijing by 15%. Similarly, morning and evening rush hour car use would increase by 10%, implying that vehicle ownership restrictions have caused large decreases in congestion. Although we do not observe vehicle emissions, lower VKT implies substantial reductions in emissions of local air pollutants and greenhouse gases.====These conclusions have important implications for localities considering vehicle ownership restriction policies. In combination, our findings suggest that these policies are very effective at decreasing the number of cars owned and total distance driven. These changes also would be accompanied by substantial reductions in congestion, fuel consumption, and pollution emissions. In cities such as Beijing, with well-developed public transportation systems, our results also imply that limiting the expansion of vehicle ownership does not significantly increase overall commute distances.====The decrease in driving caused by the ownership restrictions implies substantial environmental benefits. However, we note that policies restricting vehicle ownership may still be economically inefficient. External costs of driving clearly vary across space and time, with travel in central areas of cities and during rush hours imposing higher costs. Pricing congestion and emissions would be more efficient because they restrict driving in proportion to external costs. In complementary work using the same data (Liu et al., 2018a, 2018b), we find that the Beijing lottery had unintended consequences, reducing fertility rates and female employment. Moreover, lotteries themselves may be allocatively inefficient compared with auctions, as demonstrated by Li (2019). Notwithstanding these inefficiencies, our analysis shows that Beijing's vehicle ownership restrictions have unambiguously reduced vehicles owned and distance driven, standing in stark contrast to the effects of vehicle usage restrictions.",The effect of vehicle ownership restrictions on travel behavior: Evidence from the Beijing license plate lottery,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069619300300,7 October 2019,2019,Research Article,258.0

We identify a new ","Attempts to tackle climate change and limit global carbon emissions such as the 2015 Paris Agreement naturally threaten the revenues of fossil energy resource owners like the OPEC countries. Also, the recent discussions on stranded assets and a carbon bubble emphasize far-reaching implications of climate policy for international capital markets.==== Both dimensions are potentially important for OPEC countries, which not only export oil, but also hold large sovereign wealth funds==== and other types of petrodollar-financed capital investments (cf. Andersen et al. (2017)). Moreover, the Saudi government's announced plan to establish a new large sovereign wealth fund and make “investments the source of Saudi government revenue, not oil” (Waldman, 2016) suggests that these countries' supply strategy increasingly rests on two pillars.====While the strategic supply-side reactions to climate policies have been extensively studied, the two-pillar nature of OPEC countries' supply behavior has not been considered in this literature so far. In doing so, we identify a new transmission channel of climate policy which can significantly alter the supply reactions to the policies by taking two additional observations into account. First, the two pillars – oil revenues and capital asset returns – are intertwined by the interplay of the oil and the capital market due to the considerable complementarity of oil (and other fossil resources) and physical capital reflected in the central role of oil in the world economy. Oil prices can heavily affect the business cycle and the resulting returns for stock- and bondholders, especially in the major oil importing countries.==== Also, long-term paths of economic growth and capital accumulation are affected by the availability of oil.==== In turn, fast-growing economies like China have a significant impact on oil demand and prices.==== Second, despite many suppliers of oil, the global market share of 42% (in 2013) of OPEC suggests a significant degree of concentration in the oil market, especially in the longer run.====To represent the multi-dimensional interaction between the oil market, the capital market, and oil market power we build on the scarce literature on fossil resource monopoly in general equilibrium.==== We introduce climate policy into the framework of Marz and Pfeiffer (2015). The “capital asset motive”, which was newly identified therein, results from the capital income pillar pointed out before and from the influence of resource supply on capital returns.==== Specifically, we apply a two-period general-equilibrium model of the world economy with oil, capital, and labor as production inputs and endogenous capital formation. The interest rate and savings, which determine physical capital accumulation,==== are endogenously affected by oil supply. The resulting capital stock drives oil demand and revenues for the exporting country. These relationships are known to the government, or the state-owned oil company, of the oil-rich country, which finances its households' consumption by exporting oil and investing its savings in the importing country, which produces final goods.==== We focus on a monopolist as the opposite to perfect competition, and abstract from extraction costs and backstop substitutes for simplicity.====The new transmission channel of climate policy arises from the asset motive and endogenous savings. First, the impact of the introduction or increase of a future carbon tax in the importing country on oil profits incentivizes the oil exporter to accelerate extraction, exacerbating climate damages – an outcome coined the “Green Paradox” by Sinn (2008). Second, however, facing the future oil income loss and overall oil asset devaluation, the oil-rich country saves more to smooth consumption. Larger future asset holdings strengthen the complementarity-driven influence of oil supply on the exporting country's future capital income. The resulting incentive to postpone oil supply can be strong enough to overcompensate the first acceleration incentive.====The literature on the supply-side effects of climate policies has thoroughly examined whether, and when, the extraction of fossil fuels is accelerated or not, and whether this leads to larger climate damages. A wide range of aspects and mechanisms have been considered, like more detailed representations of extraction costs, perfect and imperfect substitutes, dirty substitutes like coal, or the interaction between geographical and intertemporal leakage.==== In most of these contributions, resource market power is not crucial. For example, van der Ploeg and Withagen (2012) and Grafton et al. (2012) both conclude that market power does not fundamentally change their results from the respective competitive market case. More recently, however, Andrade de Sá and Daubanes (2016) pointed out that climate policies can be neutral with respect to monopolistic resource extraction under permanent limit pricing (cf. Hoel (1978, 1983)). Gilbert and Goldman (1978), van der Meijden and Withagen (2016), and van der Meijden et al. (2018) also show that with phase(s) of limit pricing due to resource market power with a substitute, policies like a subsidy for the substitute can induce postponement instead of acceleration of extraction. We also contribute to the understanding of the role of market power for the supply-side reaction, without considering extraction costs, backstops, or limit pricing. Instead, we focus on capital-market implications of market power in general equilibrium, which the aforementioned literature does not take into account.====The focus on the role of market power also differentiates our work from the literature on supply-side reactions to climate policies in general equilibrium (Long, 2015; Eichner and Pethig, 2011; Smulders et al., 2012; Long and Stähler 2018).==== Van der Ploeg (2016) and, in particular, van der Meijden et al. (2015) who apply frameworks very similar to ours, except for their competitive oil market, are the closest to our work. Van der Meijden et al. (2015) first show that the general equilibrium adjustment of the interest rate to oil supply changes can attenuate the supply-side reaction to climate policy. This effect is very small, and also present (and still very small) in our monopolistic supply setting. Second, they obtain a “tiny” postponement of extraction under quite extreme parameter settings only by assuming asymmetric preferences of the oil-exporting and oil-importing country. In this case, climate policy also directly affects the interest rate by the induced redistribution of resource rents and the according adjustment of the capital market. With market power and the capital asset based transmission channel we do not have to assume asymmetric preferences for climate policy to induce postponement of extraction. We therefore focus on symmetric preferences. By considering the respective extreme of monopoly or perfect competition, van der Meijden et al. (2015) and our contribution are complementing each other, but we point out a completely different transmission channel of climate policies.====In the numerical analysis, postponement of extraction can be observed for a wide range of plausible parameter settings. In the reference case, present extraction drops by 1.28 percent for a future ad valorem carbon tax corresponding to a carbon price of about 100 dollars per ton of carbon.==== By contrast, present extraction changes by 0 percent if the monopolist neglects the new capital asset channel and increases by 0.52 percent for a competitive oil market. Overall, we show that (even) an over time increasing carbon tax can be a viable policy option in contrast to conventional partial equilibrium analyses of climate policy instruments.====We present our model in Section 2 and characterize the monopolist's extraction decision in Section 3. In Section 4 we identify and interpret the mechanism that may lead to postponement of extraction, complemented by a numerical analysis in Section 4.3. In Section 5 we discuss our results with respect to the empirical evidence on the elasticity of oil demand and with respect to the oil market structure by introducing a competitive fringe of oil producing firms.

First, substantial fossil fuel reserves will be stranded at the end of the fossil era. Second, this is true for exploration capital too. Third, unanticipated changes in present or expected climate policy cause discrete jumps in today's valuation of physical and natural capital. Fourth, if timing and intensity of climate policy are uncertain, revaluation of assets occurs as uncertainty about future climate policy is resolved. To highlight these four effects, we use an analytical model of investment in exploration capital with intertemporal adjustment costs, reserves depletion and market capitalization, and calibrate it to the global oil and gas industry. Climate policy implements a carbon budget commensurate with 2 °C peak warming and we allow for immediate or delayed carbon ","World leaders have agreed at the Paris International COP21 Conference on Climate Change to limit global warming to 2 °C with the goal of eventually lowering that further to 1.5 °C relative to pre-industrial temperatures. Even the 2 °C target only allows for a couple of hundred Giga-tons of carbon (Gt C) of future emissions (the so-called carbon budget). But oil, gas, and coal reserves are about 3 or 4 (and for probable resources 10 to 11) times higher. McGlade and Ekins (2015) predict that one third of all oil reserves and half of gas reserves must be kept in the ground to meet the 2 °C target (McGlade and Ekins, 2015).==== Burning ==== fossil fuel reserves induces global warming far higher than 2 °C and it is surprising that share prices of oil and gas majors hardly reacted to the news of the Paris agreement.====Table 1 indicates that oil and gas companies are heavily exposed to the risk of being unable to burn all their reserves if climate policy becomes more ambitious. Total proven oil and gas reserves amount to over 300 Gt C at current economic conditions and continue to increase (BP, 2016); including coal, this figure would more than double.====Not only international companies are at risk, downstream business and producers of electricity and final goods that rely heavily on fossil fuel are strongly exposed to forced write-offs of their carbon assets. Oil-, gas- and coal-based economies are also at risk of sudden shifts in expectations about future prices for fossil fuels, often their most important source of foreign exchange, and financial markets are prone to instability emanating from policy-induced drops in the market values of fossil fuel based industries, much like during the financial crisis of 2007 which started in the relatively small residential U.S. real estate sector (Hjort, 2016; Battiston et al., 2017).====Our main objective is to gain an analytical and quantitative understanding of the determinants of stranded assets in the fossil-fuel industry. While the stranding of natural reserves assets has been studied widely, the stranding of financial assets is still little understood. Hence, we investigate the effects of different types and intensities of policy on market valuations, investments, and carbon resources and their scarcity rents belonging or accruing to international oil and gas companies, as well as the overall characteristics of the transition to the fossil-free era (e.g. transition time and the amount of locked-up carbon) and the overall cost of policy in terms of aggregate welfare at time zero.====To gain a better understanding of what stranded assets in the context of climate policy means and to situate our research within the previous contributions, we distinguish the following four effects:====Although the first two types of asset stranding have been studied in detail, the latter two are subject of ongoing research and we believe we are the first to formally analyse all four in a consistent analytical framework. To explain and quantify these effects, we adapt Pindyck's (1978) canonical model of exploration investment, discoveries, and depletion by introducing intertemporal adjustment costs for exploration investments. Exploration thus reacts to expectations about future changes in climate policy. To what extent exploration investments must be written off and stock market value is wiped out depends on how irreversible these investments are and how costly they are to adjust for other purposes. Without such intertemporal (or inter-sectoral) adjustment costs or some form of irreversibility in exploration investments, the risk of policy does not lead to discrete jumps in market capitalization and one cannot address the issue of stranded hydrocarbon and physical assets (Karp and Rezai, 2019).====Our focus is the effects of different climate policy instruments on asset stranding (cf. Goulder and Parry, 2008; Fischer and Newell, 2008; Fischer and Salant, 2017; Rozenberg et al., 2019). We compare the effects of certain and uncertain policies designed to keep global carbon warming below the Paris target of 2 °C. Certain policies include: (i) an immediately implemented carbon tax; (ii) a delayed but credibly announced carbon tax that necessarily has to be higher to achieve the same temperature target; and (iii) a renewable energy subsidy designed to stay below the temperature cap. We compare outcomes under (ii) and (iii) with those under (i). We then focus on the effects of uncertainty around the carbon budget and ==== in two scenarios where politicians might wake up in the future and “tip” into action (we refer to this as “policy tipping”): (iv) there is a risk that climate policy gets toughened to meet the temperature target at some future date (before it is too late); and (v) there is a risk as in (iv) but it is eventually followed through at some even later date by a definite move to toughening climate policy to meet the temperature target in case the previous attempt at climate policy gets botched.====Policies (i) and (ii) give rise to a carbon tax that rises at a rate equal to the interest rate. Relative to the first-best policy (i), the delayed carbon tax (ii) speeds up fossil fuel extraction as companies try to avoid the burden of taxation. As a result, carbon emissions are brought forward thus accelerating global warming ahead of introducing the delayed carbon tax, which is the green paradox effect (cf. Sinn, 2008). To make up for the time wasted and the additional emissions due to the green paradox, the delayed carbon tax must be higher than an immediately implemented carbon tax to meet the same temperature target. The second-best climate policy (ii) shifts demand and carbon emissions to the near future and discourages costly exploitation investment and discoveries. This boosts the profitability of existing exploration capital stock and preserves some of the shareholder wealth lost under the immediate tax. Whether aggregate welfare at time zero increases or not depends on whether oil and gas supply is more responsive to prices than energy demand (van der Ploeg, 2016). A subsidy to renewable energy (iii) also accelerates fossil fuel use and global warming in the short run (green paradox) but curbs ==== fossil use and emissions and warming in the long run. Investments in discovery and exploration are discouraged and more fossil fuel is locked up. Scenarios (iv) and (v) illustrate what the risk of policy tipping does to the market capitalization of oil and gas companies at various points in time: at the introduction of uncertainty, before the date at which policy tipping might take place, and after that date depending on whether the attempt to implement an announced climate policy is successful or abandoned (stranded assets effects 3 and 4 above).====Our model focuses on the oil and gas industry and reduces the role of renewable energies to that of a perfect substitute for fossil fuel, which can be produced at constant unit cost without requiring capital investments. This carbon-free source of energy drives out fossil fuel in a finite number of years.==== We investigate these issues in a calibrated version of our model of exploration investment, fossil fuel discoveries, climate policy, and stranded financial assets. Our focus is on exploration investment and discoveries of oil and gas reserves. Oil and gas companies must make substantial exploitation investments in rigs and similar infrastructure. With a risk of policy tipping or an unanticipated change in future climate policy, past exploitation investments become stranded and the share prices of oil and gas companies will drop. If previously announced attempts at policy are abandoned or botched, profitability and capitalization of these companies will rise.====Gollier (2019) discusses the effects of correlations between uncertainties in consumption growth and marginal abatement cost on the risk-adjusted discount rate to be used for the Hotelling path for the efficient carbon price, but we will abstract from such uncertainties and focus at policy uncertainties instead. Salant (2016) shows that the ongoing risk of future regulatory intervention increases the cost of maintaining a cap in the European Emissions Trading System even if no regulatory intervention occurs. We obtain a similar insight, but our aim is to show the different types of stranded assets effects caused by policy tipping in a general equilibrium framework. The novelty of our paper is to disaggregate the welfare effects of anticipated climate policies on the objective function of the oil and gas industry. We find that a delayed carbon tax compatible with staying below 2 °C boosts market capitalization of the oil and gas industry relative to an immediately implemented carbon tax compatible with staying below 2 °C, since it allows the industry to shift production towards the present and carbon taxation to the future. Given that there are adjustment costs to capital, this improves the profitability of the oil and gas industry as measured in the discounted stream of profits. The same reasoning applies to the cases of a renewable subsidy and risks of policy tipping. These second-best policies, however, come with deadweight loss for society.====Section 2 reviews empirical evidence on the drivers of discoveries and exploration investments showing that fossil fuel companies do not anticipate an end to their business model anytime soon and that the availability of fossil fuels is not a limiting factor on economic growth as purported by the “peak-oil” hypothesis. Section 3 sets up our model of exploration investments and discoveries of fossil fuel reserves and derives the first-best optimal allocations that are compatible with a temperature cap of 2 °C. Section 4 shows that the resulting first-best command optimum can be replicated in the market economy if policy makers implement a Hotelling path for the carbon tax with no need for a renewable energy subsidy. Section 5 discusses how second-best and policy-tipping scenarios can be calculated. Section 6 discusses our calibration to business as usual and contrasts with first-best outcomes. Section 7 discusses the second-best outcomes. Section 8 shows how markets respond to probabilistic policy tipping. Stranded assets effects 1 and 2 occur in all scenarios, while second-best outcomes induce in addition effect 3. Effect 4 only occurs under probabilistic policy tipping in section 8. Sensitivity results are presented in section 9. Section 10 concludes and discusses stranded assets in other industries and policy implications.

We also provide a simple formula for how the optimal subsidy to deployment of a “clean” sector depends on its rate of “learning-by-doing” and on its socially-optimal growth. So, if the sector should grow faster for other reasons, its optimal subsidy is increased, showing that its optimal growth rate is faster still—our “acceleration effect”. Our calibrations show that, to limit global climate change to 2====C warming, investments in coal-fired power stations must end very soon. Considering second-best settings, we show that carbon taxes achieve stringent policy targets more efficiently, but subsidies to the “clean” sector deliver higher welfare, and are more efficient, when policy targets are more mild.","When should we make a “green” investment? Is early deployment of expensive options worthwhile, if it helps us to “learn”? And how soon should we ensure that all new investments are “green”? These questions are pertinent across many sectors, especially when investments are long-lived. For example, cities may need to expand to house 1.5 billion more people over the next two decades; characteristics of their current development may affect emissions for many years to come (Bhattacharya et al., 2015). In this paper we focus our attention on one critical source of greenhouse-gas emissions: the power sector.====So, in particular, what is the optimal time to stop investment in fossil-fuel-based power plants? The world continues to make big investments into their construction, particularly coal-based plants: estimates suggest that almost 1 trillion US dollars of such investments are planned (Shearer et al., 2016). Given the long lifetimes of fossil fuel based power plants, the emissions embodied in this infrastructure potentially undermine stringent long-term climate objectives, such as the 2====C target (see Pfeiffer et al., 2016). As such, a fast coal phase-out strategy is considered as one of the necessary conditions to achieve a transformation in line with the Paris Agreement. Some countries such as the UK, Finland and France have significantly reduced their power production from coal in recent years and announced the phasing out of coal completely in the coming 10–15 years. On the other hand, production of electricity from renewable sources has become more competitive, expanding dramatically, primarily due to the decline in costs driven by learning-by-doing in this sector.====Economists advocate a withdrawal from polluting sectors driven by carbon pricing. And investments in the clean energy sector are driven by subsidies. So a natural third question is to ask: which of these policy instruments (carbon tax or subsidy) is more efficient in terms of maximizing social welfare in a second-best setting, where only one instrument is available?====In this paper, we study these questions both theoretically and numerically. Our analysis is thus in two complementary parts. First, in a simplified and very general model, we explore the properties of irreversible investment decisions (Arrow, 1968; Arrow and Kurz, 1970; Greenwood et al., 1997). The model characterizes optimal irreversible investment decisions when it is known that returns on this capital are due to fall, leading to important implications even without uncertainty. And similarly, we explore investments, returns and optimal subsidies for investments into technologies in a sector that undergoes learning-by-doing (Wright, 1936; Arrow, 1962).====We then quantify the importance of irreversibility and learning-by-doing in a dynamic general equilibrium climate-economy model. This is based on DICE-2013 (Nordhaus, 2014a) and its annualized version (Cai et al., 2016) but deviates in two important ways. Firstly, the energy sector is modeled explicitly, with irreversibility in investments in capital stocks in both a “dirty” sector and a “clean” sector, and with the latter sector characterized by learning-by-doing. And secondly, as well as using the damage function of Nordhaus (2014a), we also consider scenarios in which global temperature changes do not exceed 2====C. This stringent target makes both the irreversibility and the learning-by-doing more important, and it is more in line with current international aspirations. Given the two externalities present in our model (global warming and learning-by-doing), we consider cases in which both a carbon tax and subsidy instruments (the first-best setting) or only one of the two instruments (the second-best) are available.====The four main findings of the paper are as follows. First, we establish a theoretical result for the relationship between climate policies and investment in dirty capital stocks, which we call the “irreversibility effect”: if dirty capital cannot be converted to other capital, then it is optimal to stop investing in dirty capital earlier (compared to a case in which investment is reversible). Irreversibility in investment implies an earlier shift to investment in the clean sector, to avoid a future stranding of assets in the dirty energy sector. This shift therefore reduces emissions in the short term. We thus demonstrate that irreversibility effects on the demand side ==== the effects of a carbon tax in the short term. This is in contrast with the standard Green Paradox effect (see e.g., Sinn, 2008, 2015; Jensen et al., 2015) which focuses on the ==== of a fossil fuel resource and shows that the knowledge of an increasing carbon tax will increase extraction of fossil fuels and will thus ==== the effects of the carbon tax in the short-term. Moreover, at the time at which investment in dirty fossil fuel infrastructure stops, returns on its existing assets go above those of the general economy. From the perspective of an investor, this result makes perfect sense. In the long-term, returns on this investment will fall, and thus, current investments are only attractive when short-term excess returns (relative to those of the general economy) are sufficient to compensate for future losses.==== It is natural to ask for how long this “short term” irreversibility effect is relevant. We obtain a lower bound for the time period by which disinvestment must be advanced. If other things are equal, this lower bound is higher for longer-lived assets.====Second, we provide a simple and elegant expression for the optimal subsidy on technologies whose price evolves as a result of “learning-by-doing” occurring in a sector. This subsidy increases with the learning rate, and also with the optimal rate of growth of capital in this sector. (Indeed, it is simply the product of the learning rate with the sum of optimal growth and depreciation). We call this the “====” for technology policy. Thus suppose, for example, that a carbon tax on substitute sectors makes the clean technology more competitive, and so enhances growth in this sector. The acceleration effect says that the ==== growth rate is now faster still: higher growth due to market forces implies a higher optimal subsidy, supporting this high optimal growth. So, the importance of learning-by-doing is accentuated by the early withdrawal from the dirty energy sector.====Third, our quantitative results support our theoretical findings and illustrate that the net (of depreciation) rate of returns on dirty capital infrastructure with irreversible investments follows an unusual trajectory: while initially matching the returns in the general economy, it rises above the returns in the general economy when investment in dirty capital stops, and remains higher for some period of time. Within this period and for some time thereafter, investment in dirty capital will be equal to zero, although the dirty capital is not underutilized. However, returns on dirty capital will fall eventually, reaching zero once this capital is indeed underutilized (so net returns will be negative). Quantitative results illustrate that the timing of these effects depends on the climate policy target: the irreversibility effect is present only if policy objectives are stringent enough.====We can identify the acceleration effect on the optimal subsidy when we compare mild to more stringent targets. With more stringent targets, the renewable sector grows faster. Our theoretical result predicts this, for two reasons: in the stringent case, competing sectors face a higher carbon price, and additionally, the optimal subsidy is higher. We also can observe the acceleration effect by varying the learning rate and calculating the associated optimal subsidy. In early periods, the subsidy is convex in the rate of learning, because technologies whose costs decline faster will also have higher initial optimal growth. However, in later periods (for instance, 2050 or 2100), the relationship is slightly concave. Rapid early deployment of fast-learning technologies leads to faster market saturation, and so slower optimal growth in later periods. Thus, at such times, the subsidy is sub-linear in the learning rate.====Finally, under the second-best setting, we quantitatively explore which instrument—carbon tax or subsidy—yields a lower welfare loss compared with the first-best situation. We show that under a less ambitious climate policy, the economy is better off with the subsidy, while carbon pricing induces a lower welfare loss compared with the subsidy if climate policies are more ambitious.====In terms of the implications of our results, this paper contributes to the debate on characteristics of optimal policy to combat climate change. Some advocate a “gradual slope” in policy implementation because economic growth implies that the current generation is poor relative to future generations, and so should not bear large costs of emission reductions. Moreover, doing so reduces pressure for premature retirement of the existing dirty capital stock, and it provides valuable time to develop low-cost, low-carbon-emitting technologies.==== Others counter this line of reasoning by arguing that an effective way to reduce abatement costs is to accelerate learning-by-doing.==== We find that early investment in the renewable sector is crucial, not only to accelerate the decline in the costs of clean energy, but also to prevent later stranding of assets that use fossil fuels. Our quantitative results within the second-best setting (with only one policy instrument available) emphasize the importance of adopting carbon pricing, an instrument that can facilitate a rapid decarbonization of the global power sector under an ambitious climate policy target like that set under the Paris Agreement. However, considering the past 10–20 years, relatively unambitious policy has manifested itself in a large part through subsidies on renewables; if that less ambitious level of emission reductions had been optimal, that single choice of instrument may well have been an excellent second best. Our quantitative results under a second-best setting, where carbon pricing action is restricted by political economy issues, illustrate that the subsidy needs to be higher (if the carbon tax is lower than the optimal first-best level) to compensate. In later periods, once renewable technologies reach maturity, there is no need to maintain the same level of subsidies. Thus, the subsidies help to overcome political constraints in the short-run, to reach the climate target, and help to develop the renewable sector to play its role in the economy in the longer term.====Finally, our paper speaks to the debate on stranded assets and climate policy.==== The literature so far has focused on the necessity of stranding fossil fuel reserves, if one is to limit climate change to less than two degrees of warming.==== As we show, the implications for investment are different when one considers the stranding of assets that ==== the fuel.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section we discuss related literature. In Section 3 we present a simple analytical model in which we characterize optimal irreversible investment decisions when the anticipated returns on those investments will fall in the future. In Section 4 we consider a simple model of investment into production processes that undergo learning-by-doing. Section 5 describes how we set up the full dynamic general equilibrium climate-economy model to quantify the theoretical results.

Political-economy related aspects are considered in the government's objective function. Lobbying power of firms or fiscal considerations by the government lead to time inconsistency: The government will deviate from a previously announced carbon ,"Achieving internationally agreed climate targets will require ambitious climate policies. While those policies are generally seen as welfare improving (as they internalize external costs), they will also create losers who may have the political power to veto the necessary reforms (Arent, 2017; Sovacool et al., 2016; Trebilcock, 2014). Hence, in order to successfully implement climate policy, it is important for governments to consider aspects related to the political economy of reforms together with other factors such as the reforms' technical soundness and administrative feasibility (Rentschler and Bazilian, 2017; Sdralevich et al., 2014). The energy sector is a major contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, primarily due to fossil fuel combustion. The IPCC (2014) estimated the global share of energy related emissions to be 65 per cent of all anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Investment into fossil energy production is continuing (Jackson et al., 2017) despite recent costs degressions into alternatives, notably renewable energy (Creutzig et al., 2017). One reason for this ongoing trend is related to the distribution of costs of mitigating climate change, e.g. through higher carbon prices. These costs are borne by workers (e.g. in the fossil fuel sectors), fossil fuel resource owners, owners of fossil energy firms, and consumers that would suffer from potential energy price increases (Fay et al., 2015; Vogt-Schilb and Hallegatte, 2017). Some actors have been particularly powerful lobbyists in the past, influencing climate policy outcomes (Kim et al., 2016).====Investments in fossil fuels, particularly coal, endanger long term climate stabilization targets as they commit societies to large carbon emissions in the future (Bertram et al., 2015; Davis et al., 2010; Edenhofer et al., 2018). Limiting global warming to well below two degrees Celsius, as demanded by the Paris Agreement, might imply that some fossil capital stocks might not be used at full capacity – these assets become stranded. The term ‘stranded assets’ is used to describe various situations, which include assets that are lost as a consequence of climate impacts, capital that is retired prematurely or is under-utilized as a consequence of climate policies, and fossil fuel resources that cannot be burned if a given climate target is to be reached (Caldecott, 2017). The latter is also referred to as unburnable carbon (McGlade and Ekins, 2015). Recent literature has focused on stock market implications of climate impacts (Dietz et al., 2016) and the consistency of investment decisions with climate targets (Carbon Tracker Initiative, 2013, 2015).====In this emerging literature, assets are stranded due to an unanticipated shock, either in climate-change related damages or in energy policy (e.g. Rozenberg et al., 2017). However, investment decisions are guided by expectations and it seems implausible to assume that investors neglect consideration of climate policy or climate damages. When expectations are rational and perfect insurance markets exist, shocks would not create losses. If no prefect insurance markets exist but firms are risk neutral, expected losses should be zero. Stranded assets are therefore related to a concrete realization of an uncertain variable. Another possibility of stranded assets to occur is shown by Baldwin et al. (2018), where investments are irreversible and an announced carbon tax increases at a sufficiently high rate. Because owners of dirty capital cannot divest above the natural depreciation rate, profits become negative at some point of time due to excessive capacity. As profits are excessive before they turn negative, losses are compensated in earlier periods.====In this paper, we employ a non-stochastic perspective on the role of stranded assets for climate policy that is related to the strategic game between regulator and investors. We develop a stylized model of the power sector with non-polluting renewable and polluting fossil firms. We consider political economy aspects á la Grossman and Helpman (1994), such as the lobbying power of energy firms, of fossil fuel resource owners and of owners of land, as well as fiscal policy aspects. Stranded assets occur if investors naively believe in the government's announced tax policy and if the government deviates from its policy after investments had been made. Hence, stranded assets arise due to a non-anticipated time-inconsistent policy. Time-inconsistency, in turn, results from the government taking political economy aspects (lobbying power or public finance aspects) into account. Assuming rational expectations, investors anticipate the government to deviate from its previously announced policy. Under rational expectations, only two time-consistent policies exist: The optimal policy is either a zero carbon tax (effectively no climate policy) or a prohibitive carbon tax (implying no fossil energy production) – all or nothing. Which equilibrium prevails depends on the political power of firms that have no constant-returns-to-scale technology, here landowners and fossil resource owners, as they lobby for higher rents. Lobbying power of firms with constant-returns-to-scale, here energy firms, and fiscal policy considerations become irrelevant as profits and tax revenues are zero.====The paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we review the economic literature on time inconsistency and climate policy, given its importance for our modeling approach. We then introduce our benchmark model in Section 3. In Section 4, we endogenize the policy choice by considering a government objective function that includes public finance as well as political economy aspects, in addition to standard welfare aspects. Our results are discussed along four dimensions: 1) the role of alternative policy instruments; 2) the role of land rents; 3) the implications for the environment; and 4) dynamics with more general production functions. We conclude in the final Section.",All or nothing: Climate policy when assets can become stranded,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069618302432,4 February 2019,2019,Research Article,263.0

These policy instruments imply different transitions to the same balanced growth path. The optimal carbon price minimizes the discounted social cost of the transition to clean capital, but may prompt premature retirement of existing polluting capacities and significant private costs in the form of stranded assets. Second-best mandates and feebates affect new investment decisions without providing incentives to under-use existing polluting equipment. These instruments lead to higher discounted social costs, but smoother ====, and do not result in premature retirement or stranded assets. A phased-in carbon price can avoid premature retirement but still result in stranded assets, that is in a drop of ==== for the owners of polluting capital. We discuss a potential trade-off between the political feasibility and cost-effectiveness of climate mitigation policies.","For the past centuries, economic growth has involved installing fossil-fueled capital, such as coal power plants and gasoline-fueled cars, which release greenhouse gases (GHG) to the atmosphere. Science has established that this release of GHG was resulting in dangerous climate change. To stabilize climate and manage disruption and damages, economies must reduce emissions to near-zero levels (IPCC, 2014; Fay et al., 2015). Doing so implies a transition from production based on polluting capital to production based on clean, carbon-neutral capital.====In principle, the optimal policy to enforce such a transition is to use a carbon price (Pigou, 1932; Nordhaus, 1991; Pearce, 1991), imposed through a carbon market or, perhaps preferably (Goulder and Schein, 2013), a carbon tax. Combined with targeted innovation policies, a carbon price could redirect investment away from polluting and towards clean capital at a relatively low cost (IPCC, 2014).====Such carbon prices, however, may create immediate ====, that is, assets that suffer from premature write-downs, devaluations, or financial liabilities.==== The lifetime of equipment in the transportation, building, industry, and energy sectors range from about a decade–in the case of a car– to half a century for power plants, and even centuries for city shapes and transportation systems (Davis et al., 2010; Guivarch and Hallegatte, 2011; Sachs et al., 2014). Older vintages were built before climate change was identified as a serious threat, and many existing vintages were intended for use several decades into the future (Davis and Socolow, 2014; Rozenberg et al., 2015; Shearer et al., 2017; Pfeiffer et al., 2018). A sudden change in prices induced by environmental taxes may decrease the income generated by these assets, causing them to lose a significant share of their book value prematurely. For instance, a taxi company could write off the book value of its fleet if gasoline prices increase significantly. At worse, carbon prices could make carbon-intensive assets become entirely unprofitable. For instance, Johnson et al. (2015) estimated that a carbon price consistent with the 2 °C target will result in the premature retirement of at least 165 billion US dollars' worth of coal power plants worldwide.====Stranded assets may create political economy issues and obstruct the implementation of substantial carbon prices (Jenkins, 2014; Bertram et al., 2015; Vogt-Schilb and Hallegatte, 2017). Indeed, stranded assets are a visible loss of wealth concentrated in a few vested interests, such as the coal industry, who may oppose reform — and in some cases may even have the power to veto it (Olson, 1977; Trebilcock, 2014).==== In a recent speech, the Governor of the Bank of England also expressed concern that the magnitude of such stranded assets could threaten the stability of the financial system (Carney, 2016).====This paper uses a simple model to investigate how alternative policy instruments may reduce stranded assets and premature retirement of polluting capital during the transition to clean capital. We focus on the effect of instruments such as mandates for new power plants; moratoriums or bans on new coal power plants; ==== programs that tax new energy-inefficient equipment and subsidize new energy-efficient equipment; energy efficiency standards on new buildings and appliances; and subsidized loans and tax breaks for investing in energy efficiency. These instruments are similar in redirecting private investment away from polluting capital and towards clean capital without directly affecting the owners of the existing stock of polluting capital, for instance without providing incentives to drive less or operate existing gas power plants instead of existing coal power plants.====We analyze how using carbon prices, mandates, feebates, or performance standards leads to different costs and dynamics of the transition from polluting to clean capital, with a particular focus on premature retirement and revenues from existing capital. We compare the first-best carbon price, designed to reduce the discounted cost of the transition, and second-best feebates or mandates designed to minimize costs while avoiding premature retirement. A motivation for comparing these instruments is that while some governments have enacted carbon prices (World Bank, 2016), most existing emission-reduction policies regulate only new investment (IEA, 2016; IPCC, 2014, p. 28).====In addition, phased-in carbon prices have been proposed to reduce adjustment costs (Williams, 2012); and actual implementation of carbon prices, for instance in British Columbia and France, have been staged progressively. We thus also look at the second-best phased-in carbon price schedule designed to minimize costs while avoiding premature retirement.====We use a Ramsey model with two types of capital (as in Acemoglu et al., 2012): ==== capital, which creates GHG emissions, and ==== capital, which does not. We disregard knowledge spillovers and we model the climate change constraint as a GHG concentration ceiling. Investment is assumed to be irreversible, as in Arrow and Kurz (1970): existing polluting capital cannot be converted back into consumption or transformed into clean capital.====We allow for under-utilization of existing polluting capital, however; a feature that is generally omitted in multi-sector growth models. In a model with two types of capital and possible under-utilization of capacities, emission-reduction efforts can be divided between two qualitatively different channels: (i) long-term abatement through accumulation of clean capital instead of polluting capital (e.g. agents buy electric cars instead of gasoline-fueled cars); and (ii) immediate abatement through under-utilization or early decommissioning of polluting capital (e.g. agents drive less or scrap their gasoline cars).====We find that all policy instruments lead to the same long-term growth path, in which most installed capital is clean and carbon concentration is maintained at its maximum acceptable value. The optimal carbon price and the second-best phased-in carbon price, feebates, and mandates, however, induce different short-term pathways in terms of emissions and costs, and in particular different levels and distribution of costs.====Unsurprisingly, the carbon price minimizes the total discounted cost of the climate change policy. Under a carbon price, investment is redirected towards clean capital until polluting capital has depreciated to a level compatible with the concentration ceiling.====In addition, the carbon price creates stranded assets. In particular, part of the existing polluting capital is under-utilized or retired prematurely if climate policies are stringent enough; that is, if the carbon price is greater than the marginal productivity of polluting capital over its carbon intensity. Such outcomes are part of the least-cost strategy, because under-utilization or the early scrapping of polluting capital reduces carbon emissions from excessive legacy polluting assets.====This strategy sets a disproportionate cost on the owners of polluting capital, however====: premature retirement reduces their revenues to zero while polluting capacities are under-used. Even if it does not cause premature retirement, the carbon price creates stranded assets: it ties a new cost to the utilization of existing polluting capital and thus decreases its net value.====In contrast, mandates, feebates, or standards on new investment do not tie a new cost to the utilization of existing capital. These instruments thus avoid stranded assets and their extreme form, the premature retirement of polluting capital.====The second-best phased-in carbon price designed to avoid early retirement results in the same transition and same social costs as mandates, feebates, or standards, but it fails to avoid stranded assets: it may adjust at the level that cancels all revenues for the owners of current capital, so that they are indifferent between renting out their assets or scrapping them.====Mandates, feebates, and phased-in carbon prices are less efficient than the first-best carbon price. They create higher social costs: society keeps using obsolete polluting capacities until the end of their lifetime instead of scrapping them, as if refusing to recognize that past accumulation of polluting capital was a mistake. We track analytically the social cost resulting from past excessive investment in dirty capacity (directly linked to the assumption that investment is irreversible), and we call it ====.====With phased-in carbon prices, as with optimal carbon prices, those legacy costs fall directly on the owners of stranded assets in the form of reduced rental rates. Feebates and mandates do not create stranded assets, however. These instruments can even increase the value of existing polluting capacity relative to the value of clean capacity, as they create a scarcity on the supply of polluting capacities without imposing a cost on their utilization.====These results suggest that policy makers face a choice between: (1) a higher intertemporal welfare with the optimal carbon price; (2) less immediate costs with a phased-in carbon price; and (3) less immediate costs and no stranded assets with feebates, mandates, or standards.====Finally, another important difference between the optimal carbon price and the other instruments is their mere ====. Since they do not lead to the decommissioning of any polluting capital, second-best feebates, standards and phased-in carbon prices reduce emissions more slowly than the optimal carbon price, and cannot achieve too stringent GHG concentration targets; while the optimal carbon price could reduce emissions as quickly as needed.====Empirical evidence suggests that it could still be technically possible to reach the 2 °C target while avoiding stranded assets. For instance, Davis et al. (2010) estimate that emissions embedded in existing long-lived capital and infrastructure in 2010 committed us to a warming of about 1.3 °C. Findings by Rogelj et al. (2013), Johnson et al. (2015), and Iyer et al. (2015), however, suggest that the least-cost pathway toward a 2 °C-compliant economy does involve stranding assets. And Pfeiffer et al. (2018) find that just existing power plants, if used over their typical lifetime, would exhaust the carbon budget allowable to the power sector. Governments willing to limit global warming below 2 °C might still have a choice between first-best carbon prices and second-best feebates or standards, which implies a trade-off between minimizing discounted costs and avoiding stranded assets.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 details our contribution to the literature. Section 3 presents the basic model and considers the ==== equilibrium. In section 4 we consider a social planner that maximizes utility under a climate constraint, and show how its strategy can be decentralized with a carbon price. In section 5, we consider a modified social planner's program where premature retirement is to be avoided, and we look at how second-best mandates, feebates, or a phased-in carbon price can decentralize that constrained strategy. In section 6, we study the timing issues and risks of lock-in when premature retirement is avoided.

Against this background, the International Energy Agency’s (2018) report on Global Energy and CO2 showed that the share of renewables in electricity generation reached a record level of 17 percent in the U.S. where major oil companies have continued to invest in low-carbon technologies. Moreover, in September 2018, the then-governor of California (the largest U.S. state), Jerry Brown, signed an executive order committing the state to being carbon-neutral by 2045. As Hultman and Bodnar (2018) put it, “Trump tried to kill the Paris agreement, but the effect has been the opposite.”====These actions may be due to the public-spirited behavior of firms and state governments. But, as this paper shows, they could also be the result of profit-maximizing behavior and successful lobbying efforts of firms in the face of weaker environmental standards. If this is the case, a decision to relax emission standards could increase firms’ incentives to adopt clean technologies. However, the overall level of emissions may increase, since the cleaner technologies enable firms to produce more. Also, since industry profitability may be reduced by the weakening of environmental standards, if there is a chance that the decision will be reversed later, firms in large states have an incentive to lobby state governments to implement stricter environmental standards.====Of course, we are not the first to study how emission standards affect firms’ technology choices.==== Acemoglu et al. (2012) show how temporary environmental regulations can redirect technical change toward clean technologies and avoid environmental disasters. Acemoglu and Rafey (2018) study the effects of geoengineering and show that if the government cannot commit to future policies, the anticipated reduction in future taxes may discourage firms from adopting cleaner technology.====Particularly relevant to our analysis are Perino and Requate (2012) and Krass et al. (2013) who show that increasing carbon taxes does not monotonically increase firms' adoption of green technology. Indeed, when taxes are very high, firms’ production quantity can be so small that switching to cleaner technology generates insufficient additional profit to offset the fixed costs.

Incentives for individual producers are the classic policy response for a socially efficient balance between livelihoods and the environment. Yet monitoring individual miners is ineffective, or it is very costly, especially on frontiers with scattered small-scale miners. We ask whether monitoring at a group level effectively incentivizes cleaner artisanal mining by combining lower-cost external monitoring with local collective action. We employ a mining-framed, threshold-public-goods experiment in Colombia's Pacific region, with 640 participants from frontier mining communities. To study compliance with collective environmental targets, we vary the target stringency, including to compare increases over time in the stringency versus decreases. We find that collective incentives can induce efficient equilibria, with group compliance – and even inefficient overcompliance – despite the existence of equilibria with zero contributions. Yet, for demanding targets in which the reward for compliance barely outweighs the cost, compliance can collapse. Those outcomes improve with past successes for easier targets, however, so our results suggest gain from building coordination via graduated stringency.","Small-scale gold mining (SSGM) is an important economic activity within the developing world, including for many poor rural households living far out on the frontier. Yet it has many negative environmental consequences (Hinton, 2005; Hentschel et al., 2003; Hilson, 2003). It is the world's largest mercury polluter, putting ∼100 million people at risk (Wade, 2013), and a leading driver of landscape change in environmentally critical regions such as the Amazon (Asner et al., 2013; Swenson et al., 2011). Alluvial mining removes significant quantities of sand, gravel and rock, contributing to sedimentation and acidification of important rivers that, in turn, carry emissions downstream, sometimes to large populations. In addition, open pits filled with water can be sources of mosquito-borne diseases like malaria (Castellanos et al., 2016; Crompton et al., 2002).====Regulation has not addressed these issues on the frontier. Command-and-control policies suitable for interactions with large firms have been applied to small-scale mining, despite states' inability to enforce for scattered small-scale miners (Hinton, 2005). This has yielded chaotic, open-access, poorly organized mining (Shoko, 2002). Further, unlike for common-pool resources where only local users are affected negatively by neighbors’ resource appropriations (e.g., Ostrom, 1990), SSGM generates distant externalities that do not motivate local communities to act collectively to reduce environmental impacts (Saldarriaga-Isaza et al., 2013). Local rights alone, then, will not necessarily internalize most externalities from mining. Yet, local interaction may aid governance.====Given the strengths and the weaknesses of state and local institutions for addressing such issues, we used a decision experiment in the field to explore the impacts of a collective-rewards policy, for which success depends on local interactions. Incentives are external, due to states or NGOs, yet rewards are conditioned on group compliance,==== using group metrics more feasible or cheaper for non-locals to monitor. Thus, incentives are focused not on individuals but instead on groups (see Kotchen and Segerson, 2019). Collective incentives create a local public good for such groups, so successes depend on the group's ability to solve a policy-induced collective-action problem.==== Thus, pre-existing local norms, social capital, and prior interactions should affect the outcomes. Even if miners are hard to monitor, observable aggregates (e.g., forest cover or water quality) may still provide a sufficient basis for incentives which spur group interactions and compliance.====Our experimental design − drawing upon frontier fieldwork with miner interviews and surveys − is a threshold-public-good experiment with 640 inhabitants of frontier mining communities in Colombia's Pacific region, one of the country's poorest and also most biodiverse regions. We study group compliance and individual behaviors, while varying the stringency of aggregate or group environmental targets. We compare different stringency sequences, specifically sequences with falling stringency versus rising or graduated stringency. We find that collective rewards can induce efficient group compliance, and even inefficient overcompliance, despite the existence of an equilibrium involving no contributions. For demanding targets, in which collective rewards barely outweigh compliance costs, coordination and compliance can collapse completely. Yet, if a group has succeeded previously, facing an easier target, that improves the outcomes for more demanding targets. This implies the importance of building coordination via prior successful local interactions, supporting graduated stringency in the design of such incentives. Our results indicate that such collective environmental incentives can support environmental-and-economic local ‘win-wins’, based on lower-cost aggregate monitoring that can spur local collective action.====The paper is organized as follows.

From a policy perspective, the building sector has been an important target for energy conservation policies as it is a major contributor to total energy consumption and has high potential for saving energy through efficiency measures. Buildings account for 40 percent of total energy consumption and for 36 percent of CO2 emissions in the EU (IPCC, 2007), and much of the EU energy policy has been designed to stimulate the public awareness regarding residential energy efficiency and to trigger future investments in energy efficiency.====On January 4, 2003, the European Parliament ratified the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD), a legal act inspired by the Kyoto Protocol and designed to help the European Union (EU) to reduce its CO2 emissions. The directive states that “Member states shall ensure that, when buildings are constructed, sold or rented out, an energy performance certificate is made available by the owner to the prospective buyer or tenant”. In other words, EPCs were designed and introduced to increase the informational transparency regarding the current energy efficiency of buildings, and to help buyers and tenants make well-informed decisions in the real estate market.====Within national housing markets, EPCs have been introduced as carriers of price-relevant information. In the Netherlands, the average monthly utility bill of a standard home was 150 euros in 2015, which represents 21 percent of the average mortgage due every month. In other words, energy bills matter, especially considering that these bills range between 55 and 345 euros across A-to G-labeled homes of similar size. Until recently, this variation in energy efficiency of homes was mostly unknown to prospective buyers, and therefore absent in the process of price formation. In line with Akerlof (1970), it is expected that EPCs can serve as a means for reducing this informational asymmetry between sellers and buyers, which is one of the aims of energy policy (see Gayer and Viscusi (2013) and Mannix and Dudley (2015)). Houde (2014) showed that energy certification can act as a reliable substitute for more accurate, but complex, energy information.====The EPC information is hypothesized to affect transaction prices, as the implied outlook on future user costs is discounted into the price buyers are willing to bid today. Thus far, this price effect of EPCs in the housing market has been evaluated in the academic literature by empirical studies that have measured the capitalization of energy efficiency in transaction prices. Starting with Eichholtz et al. (2010), who reported the first evidence of the economic value of “green building” in the US office market, a body of literature emerged offering comparable results for different parts of the real estate market (see Brounen and Kok, 2011; Fuerst et al., 2015; Kahn and Kok, 2014; Walls et al., 2017).====However, prices are not the only channel through which transactions are affected by informational asymmetries. Taylor (1999) identified unrevealed information as an explanation for homes not being sold. Buying a home requires a significant financial commitment of households, and the suspicion of unrevealed information is likely to scare off weary buyers, thereby slowing down the sales process. Hence, information can affect transactions through both the price and the speed of the sale. Enhancing the speed of sale could be an important argument with which policymakers can both stimulate and enforce the use of energy labeling among home-owners, a consumer group that thus far has been slow in adopting the proposed policy measures regarding residential energy efficiency. By stressing the combined effects on transaction prices and the speed of sale, EPCs can be better used to contribute to the realization of climate goals, as home owners will be positively nudged to improve the residential energy efficiency for their own benefits.====In this paper, we empirically assess the EPCs effectiveness as carriers of information by examining the effects of EPCs on the time on the market (TOM) of housing transactions. We study the Dutch housing market, as the Netherlands was one of the first countries in 2008 to adopt EPCs in the housing market on a national scale. This early adoption creates a rich data setting, as Dutch EPCs have been around for almost 10 years. Another advantage of using the Dutch data set is that the design of EPCs has changed over time. The first-generation EPCs resulted from a detailed on-site survey of the dwelling by a trained engineer, while the later, indicative labels have been modeled as a simple function of dwelling age. This change in the quality of the conveyed information is part of our research design. Finally, the Dutch housing market offers a blend of various high-quality micro-data sources, capturing dwelling characteristics and EPC details.====Our results for the period 2008–2016 indicate that EPC information effectively enhances the speed of sale, as time on the market decreases when the EPC is available. The reduction in TOM varies from 7 to 12 percent, depending on model specifications and estimation approaches. In all cases, the effect is significant and increases as labels are provided earlier during the sale process and ratings are higher. We also document that the shift in EPC regimes, switching from certificates that required an on-site assessment to indicative labels based primarily on dwelling age, reduces the power of the signal by almost 50 percent.====This paper contributes to the growing literature on how informational nudges have effects on consumer behavior (see Allcott and Sweeney, 2016; Camerer et al., 2003; Thaler and Sunstein, 2003). Although there has been extensive research on how energy information can affect consumer behavior (see Allcott, 2011; Momsen and Stoerk, 2014; Codagnone et al., 2016, among others), there is still a gap in terms of evaluating whether the existing regulation on energy efficiency information provision adequately addresses the imperfect information problem (Allcott, 2016). Our paper shows that consumers not only react to that information, but that they are also capable of distinguishing how much information is revealed by EPCs. This result can help improve the effectiveness of energy policies by offering future home sellers evidence of the benefits of communicating EPC information during the sale. Moreover, we also demonstrate that the calibration of the residential EPC schemes matter. Our results show that while the current indicative labels have managed to increase the low uptake rate of EPCs in the Dutch housing market, we also find that these indicative labels do not reduce the asymmetry between buyer and seller as much as the on-site assessment by trained engineers.====The paper continues with a discussion of our theoretical framework on information asymmetries, followed by a discussion of the Dutch housing market and corresponding EPC system. In Section 4, we present the data used in our empirical analysis. We then discuss our methodology and results and conclude with a summary of our main findings and their implications.",Energy performance certification and time on the market,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069618305084,18 October 2019,2019,Research Article,273.0

The evidence is consistent with an ecological response. I show that land use change, anti-malarial programs or migration cannot explain the effect of primary forest cover loss on increased malarial incidence. Falsification tests reveal that the effect is specific to malaria, with forest cover having no discernible effect on other diseases with a disease ecology different from that of malaria. Back-of-the-envelope calculations indicate that the morbidity-related malaria-reducing local benefits of primary forests are at least $1-$2 per hectare.","The conservation of critical ecosystems has become a definitive policy priority of sustainable development goals in the 21st century (United Nations, 2015). In settings with weak enforcement – often developing countries – there has been a growing interest in understanding the local effects of ecosystem degradation (Bauch et al., 2015; Myers et al., 2013; Prüss-Üstün and Corvalán, 2007). Does the decline in such ecosystems generate adverse health outcomes for local populations? In this paper, I document the malaria burden of increased forest cover loss in Indonesia, which has one of the highest rates of deforestation in the world.====I report two principal findings. First, primary forest cover loss increases the incidence of malaria; a 1% decline in forest cover increases malarial incidence by 1.85 percentage points, or 10%. The effect is strongest in villages near forests but persists to a lesser extent in villages more distant from forests. Conservative calculations (reported in Section 4.3) suggest that the malaria-related morbidity-reducing benefits of primary forest cover are $1-$2 per hectare.====Second, the type of forest matters; loss of primary forests that are rich in biodiversity increases incidence of malaria while loss of secondary forests, which are designated for the purposes of logging, has no impact on the incidence of malaria. This suggests an underlying ecological response, distinct from socio-economic responses such as migration or agricultural land-use that could be correlated with both forest loss and malaria. Consistent with this hypothesis, I find that the effect of primary forest cover loss is specific to malaria with no discernible impact on other diseases, inconsistent with alternative, non-ecological mechanisms that could explain the relationship between forest cover loss and malaria. I further demonstrate that the effect of forest cover loss on incidence of malaria cannot be explained by agricultural land use, anti-malarial programs or migration.====In theory, forest cover loss can affect malaria through several channels. First, forests are often cleared for agricultural activity. When such agricultural activity involves standing water (e.g., paddy cultivation) and other complimentary conditions favorable for malaria-carrying vectors, forest cover loss can indirectly lead to increased incidence of malaria. Second, forest clearing is often correlated with migratory behavior either due to labor-intensive deforestation that requires migrant labor or because of plantation and other commercial activities that attract migrants. Migrants can act as latent hosts of malaria since they typically have lower incomes and less access to medical facilities than native populations. Third, changes in forest cover can alter the disease ecology of malaria; forest cover loss results in a reduction in biodiversity and higher order species that would otherwise feed on anopheles mosquitoes, resulting in increased malarial incidence (Pattanayak and Pfaff, 2009).====The identification strategy follows a two-pronged approach. First, I use district-level annual satellite data on forest cover and rich biennial village census data on disease outbreaks, allowing me to employ a fixed-effects approach to control for time-invariant district-level geographic, climatic and demographic factors that could be correlated with both forest cover and disease incidence. I include controls for health care access, poverty measures, distance from cities, sanitation facilities, population density, government sponsored health interventions, precipitation and primary sector of employment. Second, I exploit the epidemiological differences across diseases, in particular the mode of disease transmission, to perform falsification tests on other diseases whose disease ecology differs from that of malaria and show that the effect of forest cover loss is specific to malaria. I include a number of additional robustness checks to show that agricultural land-use, migration or social programs don't don't explain the effect of forest cover loss on malaria.====While I rely on an important and long-standing literature linking forest loss to malaria (MacDonald and Mordecai, 2019; Tucker et al., 2017; Myers et al., 2013; Pattanayak and Yasuoka, 2012; Keesing et al., 2010; Pongsiri et al., 2009; Pattanayak and Pfaff, 2009; Patz et al., 2000; Walsh et al., 1993), this paper makes two important contributions to existing work. First, this paper employs a fixed-effects approach using panel data to estimate the effect of forest cover loss on the incidence of malaria.==== Previous work has relied on random-effects (Bauch et al., 2015), cross-sectional analysis (e.g., Pattanayak et al. (2010); Yasuoka and Levins (2007); see Bauhoff and Busch (2018) for a detailed review) or simulations (Laporta et al., 2013; Pattanayak et al., 2009). In contrast to these prior studies, the fixed effects specification removes time-invariant characteristics that could confound estimates. Second, the paper makes use of data from administrative heads to provide estimates for an entire country; previous work, with notable exceptions (Bauhoff and Busch, 2018) has relied on a subset of geographic areas within a country, making it difficult to generate nationwide estimates that can be directly taken to policy discussions.====In what follows, I describe the background and data (Section 2), empirical strategy (Section 3), and results (Section 4).

We conduct a randomized field experiment that jointly elicits knowledge about the cost of water and examines the impact of improved information on demand by linking a survey to water billing records. Half of our sample of 30,000 single family homeowners are randomly sent an invitation to a survey that asks questions about the water bill and the costs of water-use activities (e.g. the cost of taking a shower), and subsequently provides personalized accurate information. Results show that consumers have poor information about the marginal price of water and overestimate the costs of using water. Respondents are relatively better informed about their total bill and water consumption. In aggregate, respondents increase water use in response to the survey, potentially due to learning that water is cheaper than they previously thought. Increased consumption is concentrated among low users who are more likely to over-estimate the costs of using water.","A fundamental principle in microeconomic analysis is that consumers respond to higher prices by reducing the quantity demanded. However, the development of new pricing structures and payment mechanisms, as well as growing interconnectedness of goods and services, complicate the price-quantity decision sphere.==== Urban water represents a prime example where the link between price and quantity is obscured. Utilities often employ complicated rate structures that combine a fixed charge with a volumetric charge, and the marginal price often depends on the level of consumption. One of the most common rate structures is the increasing block rate (IBR) that charges low marginal prices for the initial units and higher marginal prices for subsequent units. These rate structures proliferated as a way to ensure a basic level of access to energy and water, goods that are deemed essential for modern life, while at the same time discouraging wasteful consumption. While the focus of this article is on perceptions and the role of information in municipal water demand, similar features exist in residential electricity markets.====We designed a survey to elicit perceptions of the cost of using water for consumers in Melbourne, Australia who face an increasing block rate structure for residential water demand. We randomly sent the survey to half of a sample of 30,000 customers for which we have billing data. The linked billing data allow us to personalize the survey with historical consumption data and estimate the effect of taking the survey on subsequent water consumption. This research design allows us to address two objectives. First, we assess the baseline customer knowledge of water prices and other features of the bill and estimate what type of consumers acquire accurate price information. This builds off the work of Attari (2014) that elicits information about water quantity, but not prices or costs. Additionally, we define and elicit the costs of specific activities (we term this cost-per-use), such as flushing the toilet, that combine both information on water prices and the quantity intensity of different activities. Second, we estimate the impact of providing updated information on water consumption.====The ability of simple price and quantity information to change consumer behavior in energy and water markets serves as evidence that consumers do not have accurate perceptions about water prices and the quantity they consume. However, most studies infer inaccurate or incomplete information from the behavioral response to information, as opposed to directly collecting consumers' price perceptions.==== In contrast, our results ==== show that consumers' price knowledge is very poor and that providing correct information changes behavior. Consumers generally know their total bill, but not the marginal price of water. Many consumers do not know how much water they use, but they have better information on the proportion of the bill that is due to volumetric charges. These results indicate that total water consumption and the marginal price are not the most relevant metrics for consumer decisions in residential water markets. This motivates our cost-per-use (CPU) elicitation for four common water activities: irrigation, toilets, washing machines, and showers. CPU combines the marginal cost of water with the water quantity requirements for common end uses. Consumers have even worse information on the cost of common water-using activities. In general consumers overestimate the marginal price of water, as well as the cost of common water activities.====We also predict what type of consumers have accurate price information. Consumers who use more water have more accurate estimates of their total bill, marginal prices, and the percentage of their bill that is due to volumetric charges. This is consistent with endogenous information acquisition where households with high water bills have a larger incentive to acquire accurate price information.==== Water consumption does not have an effect on the accuracy of the CPU estimates. We also elicit the respondents' confidence in each their estimates, which is a reasonably strong predictor of the accuracy of their estimates indicating that water costs are known unknowns.====In aggregate consumers increase water use after the survey. We estimate local average treatment effects (LATE) for taking the survey on water consumption where we use the randomized letter as an instrument. To generate more precise estimates we also use a genetic matching algorithm developed by Diamond and Sekhon (2013) to estimate average treatment effects on the treated (ATT) and embed the matched sample in a regression framework (Ho et al., 2007). Our estimates show that consumers increase consumption by roughly 6–10%.====We develop a conceptual framework that describes three primary mechanisms through which the survey may affect consumption: increased salience of moral costs, correcting price mis-perceptions, and alternative behavioral biases. We describe the alternative biases as internalities - defined as biases that prevent consumers from accounting for all the ==== benefits and costs of a particular good (Allcott and Sunstein, 2015; Allcott et al., 2014). Examples of internalities outside of imperfect price perceptions in our setting are inaccurate quantity information on specific water activities or mistakes in understanding the bill structure, such as the percentage of the bill due to volumetric charges.====On average, respondents overestimate the costs of using water and learn that water is cheaper than they previously thought. Additionally, there is evidence that the treatment effect is concentrated among lowest users who are more likely to over-estimate the costs of using water. Therefore, one interpretation of the results is that the survey serves as a price decrease, which causes an increase in consumption. Alternatively, consumers could be responding to the CPU information, which helps them re-optimize by learning the marginal cost of specific activities. The CPU information best fits into the general framework of internalities as opposed to price perceptions.====While other information such as the total bill and the proportion of the bill due to volumetric charges may also drive behavior change, consumers were initially better informed along these dimensions. We posit that pure inattention or moral costs are less plausible mechanisms explaining the demand response to the survey. If we assume that the survey only addresses price perceptions, a stylized model estimates that correcting price mis-perceptions increases consumer surplus by approximately 1% relative to average bills. Therefore, the costs of mis-information to individual consumers are low relative to the aggregate costs of water consumption.====We make several contributions to the literature: first, we document consumers' price perceptions; second, we explore who acquires accurate information on the cost of water; and third, we estimate the effect of accurate information on subsequent consumption. Both eliciting price perceptions and observing the behavioral response to updated information help us interpret the causal mechanisms through which information affects behavior. Collecting data on price perceptions also highlights the importance of understanding biases in consumer behavior. The existence of an energy efficiency gap implies that there are win-win opportunities that generate private benefits to consumers along with public benefits through reduced internalities.==== However, we find that water consumers are over-consuming relative to the private optimum, which would lead to tradeoffs between private and public benefits if there are unpriced externalities in water.====Additionally, we contribute to the evaluation of informational programs using both experimental and non-experimental methods by highlighting the bias-variance tradeoff in experimental versus non-experimental econometric methods. We extend the work by Wichman and Ferraro (2017) and Ferraro and Miranda (2017) that attempt to recover treatment effects from randomized experiments using non-experimental methods in two ways. First, we apply the methods to randomized encouragement designs, and second, we apply more recent advanced matching estimators (Diamond and Sekhon, 2013). The ability to leverage non-experimental estimators that may generate more precise estimates is particularly important for randomized encouragement designs that have low enrollment rates and limited statistical power.====Our results are relevant for research testing the appropriate price signal for consumers facing non-linear price structure. The survey results document that consumers do not have good knowledge of either marginal prices or total consumption, which makes it unlikely that consumers respond directly to either marginal or average volumetric prices. Since consumers generally know their total bill, they may exhibit non-standard behavior such as reducing consumption by a discrete amount when a water bill exceeds some bandwidth (sometimes described as “bill shock”). This fits into the mental accounting framework of Thaler (1985), and empirical evidence from other markets such as mobile phones (Grubb and Osborne, 2014; Grubb, 2015). The lack of accurate price information is related to other research examining incomplete information or imperfectly optimizing agents in residential energy and water consumers markets (Allcott and Wozny, 2014; Sallee, 2014; Houde, 2018; Brent and Ward, 2018). Documenting price perceptions has implications on the literature examining how consumers respond to nonlinear pricing (Ito, 2014; Wichman, 2014) by collecting data on what type of price information consumers actually possess.====We also show that improved price information increases water use. This finding is relevant to research studying the impact of improved price information on energy and water demand is mixed. Jessoe and Rapson (2014) show that households with easy access to real time price information via in-home displays are much more responsive to temporary energy price increases than uninformed households. Monteiro et al. (2018) find that informed water consumers are relatively more price elastic. Several other studies show that the timing and mode of billing impacts consumption. Wichman (2017) shows that increased billing frequency, which improves price information consumption, leads to higher water consumption, while Sexton (2015) finds that automatic bill payments, which reduces price information, also increases consumption. Gilbert and Zivin (2014) shows that within a billing period consumers decreases consumption immediately after receiving a bill. An important distinction is that previous research infers consumers' price information by the behavioral response to changes in the available information. We go beyond this by both estimating the demand response to information and collecting baseline information.====This research is also related to how information nudges affect energy and water demand.==== Several studies analyze how price information affects residential electricity demand. Kahn and Wolak (2013) show that an energy use tutorial that informs consumers on energy costs decreases consumption, but there are heterogeneous effects based on the rate structure. Pellerano et al. (2015) finds that increasing nonlinear price salience affects energy consumption near the kink point. McRae and Meeks (2016) elicit energy price knowledge and show how consumers with different price information reacted to historical changes in the electricity rate structure. Byrne et al. (2018) show that peer information increases electricity consumption for households who overestimated their energy use, while it decreased consumption for households who underestimated energy use. Similar to Kahn and Wolak (2013) and Stojanovski et al. (2018) show that in response to a randomized field experiment that improves price information, electricity users facing a high marginal price decrease consumption, while households facing a low marginal price do not. Our study is different by studying water demand, a well as collecting and providing different types of information such as cost-per-use.====The next section develops a conceptual framework to map potential mechanisms through which information can affect water demand. Section 3 describes the experimental design and institutional setting. Section 4 shows the results of the price and cost perceptions elicitation and analyzes what type of consumers acquire accurate price information. Section 5 describes the empirical methods and results of the field experiment by estimating the effect of updated information on subsequent water use.

To identify this relationship, we combine detailed daily data on crime, air pollution, and weather for an eight-year period across the United States. Our primary identification strategy employs extremely high dimensional fixed effects and we perform a series of robustness checks to address confounding variation between temperature and air pollution. We find a robust positive effect of increased air pollution on violent crimes, and specifically assaults, but no relationship between increases in air pollution and property crimes. The effects are present in and out of the home, at levels well below Ambient Air Pollution Standards, and PM==== effects are strongest at lower temperatures. The results suggest that a 10% reduction in daily PM==== and ozone could save $1.4 billion in crime costs per year, a previously overlooked cost associated with pollution.","Links between pollution exposure and health outcomes have been established across a broad range of disciplines. Epidemiological and toxicological studies demonstrate a strong evidence base for a wide-range of short- and long-term health effects associated with exposure to airborne particulate matter (PM) (Archsmith et al., 2018; Di et al., 2017a,b; Pope and Dockery, 1999; Pope III and Dockery, 2006; Seaton et al., 1995). Research in economics demonstrates that exposure to air pollution can have adverse effects on health (e.g., Currie et al., 2014; Deryugina et al., 2016; Schlenker and Walker, 2016), cognitive function (e.g., Bishop et al., 2018; Graff Zivin and Neidell, 2013, 2012; Lavy et al., 2014), and labor productivity (e.g., Borgschulte et al., 2018; Graff Zivin and Neidell, 2012; Hanna and Oliva, 2015), and can impose large costs on individuals and society (Anderson, 1999; Bishop and Murphy, 2011).====The mechanisms that link long-term air pollution exposure to adverse health outcomes have often been evaluated for chronic disease, respiratory problems, and mortality outcomes (Dockery et al., 1993; Glantz, 2002; Pope III et al., 2002; Samet et al., 2000; Schwartz, 2001). More recent evidence suggests that these same mechanistic pathways also have short-term effects on cognitive skills development, the expression of behaviors (e.g. aggressive, anti-social) associated with criminal or violent activities (Kioumourtzoglou et al., 2017; Lu et al., 2018), and anxiety (Power et al., 2015). However, despite a growing concern that air pollution exposure may be linked to aggressive behavior and criminal activity at a population level, we are aware of only one published study that attempts to identify this relationship (Lu et al., 2018).====In this paper, we use a unique identification strategy to study the effect of short-term exposure to air pollution on aggressive behavior at a national scale. To do so, we combine two highly detailed datasets. First, we use data on criminal activity from the National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) managed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (UCR, 2004). Our final dataset contains incident-level crime reports for over fifty categories of crime spanning 397 counties, or 28.3% of the US population, between 2006 and 2013. The high spatio-temporal resolution of the data allows us to study the effect of short-term exposure to PM==== and ozone on violent crimes, which we show is a key social cost of pollution that has heretofore been absent from policy discussions.====Second, we merge the crime data with daily-county level air pollution (PM==== and ozone) measurements spanning the entire US from 2006 to 2013. Pollution monitor data recorded by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is limited to monitor locations and is not collected on all calendar days. We use interpolated measures of PM====, which provide gridded estimates (15 km grid) of PM==== over the entire United States for every day of the 2006–2013 period (Lassman et al., 2017). This data increases the sample of county-days for which we have both PM==== and ozone measurements, and allows us to estimate a 2-pollutant model, to test for lagged effects of pollution exposure on aggressive behavior, and to estimate dose response functions.====We have several important findings. First, we find that a 10% increase in same-day exposure to PM==== is associated with a 0.14% increase in violent crimes, nearly all of which is driven by increases in assaults, which are indicative of aggressive behavior. Similarly, we find that a 10% increase in same-day exposure to ozone is associated with a 0.3% increase in violent crime or a 0.35% increase in assaults. In contrast, we find that changes in PM==== or ozone have no statistically significant effect on any other category of crime. The results are robust to a battery of tests and alternative specifications, and are not explained by weather phenomenon such as heat waves or precipitation. Second, we show that daily lags of pollution do not qualitatively affect criminal activity indicating the effects are not cumulative and are in fact contemporaneous. Third, we show that the effects of PM==== are largest at lower temperatures while the effects of ozone are largest at relatively higher temperatures. Finally, we estimate dose response functions and show that the PM==== effects are increasing until 20 μg/m====, but level off shortly thereafter. In contrast, the dose response function for ozone demonstrates an inverted U shape, indicating the effects begin to decline at higher ozone concentrations.====Our results have important implications for future research and policy. Air pollution is a substantial global issue. In 2015, ambient air pollution was considered the fifth ranking mortality risk factor with exposure to PM==== estimated to have caused 4.2 million deaths (Cohen et al., 2017). Likewise, communities and individuals that are exposed to high levels of pollution incur higher health care costs, lower labor productivity (Adhvaryu et al., 2014; Borgschulte et al., 2018; Chang et al., 2016; Graff Zivin and Neidell, 2012; Zahran et al., 2017), and possible increased anxiety and psychological stress (Power et al., 2015; Sass et al., 2017). Our results indicate there are important but understudied effects of pollution beyond long-term health effects and the extent of our understanding of the social costs of pollution may be limited by the current scope of research. For instance, our results suggest that a policy that reduces daily PM==== or ozone across the US by only 10% will save $405 million -$1 billion in crime costs per year via reduced assaults.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. The following section places our paper within a large group of relevant literature and discusses plausible mechanisms driving our results. We then outline the data used in the paper and provides summary statistics and descriptions of the data cleaning process.

A typical example are investments in transport infrastructure, which are often undertaken publicly following cost-benefit analyses (CBA). The evidence from cross-sectional survey-based contingent valuation research suggests that the income elasticity of the value of noise reduction is positive, but less than unity (Wardman et al., 2005). The value of travel time is typically set to a fraction of the wage rate (Anderson, 2014; Parry and Small, 2009), which implies a unity income elasticity, but a lower elasticity has been recently suggested (Börjesson et al., 2012). It is not clear, however, whether these estimated short-run elasticities generalize to long-run comparisons. Intuitively, the inter-temporal income elasticity should be larger than unity if locational amenities and disamenities are non-necessities, as typically conjectured in the literature (Brueckner et al., 1999; Glaeser et al., 2001). As real incomes rise, (dis)amenity values should then rise more than proportionately, implying that in appraisals of durable infrastructures costs and benefits need to be inflated rather than deflated to reflect demand by future generations. To date, there is little evidence to substantiate this intuition. There is, at best, indirect evidence, in that public spending tends to increase more than proportionately in GDP, suggesting that public services, broadly defined, are luxury goods (Wagner's law, see Lamartina and Zaghini, 2011; Ram, 1987; Wagner, 1890).====In this paper, we take a step towards filling this gap by providing the first long-run comparison of transport amenity and disamenity capitalization effects in land prices over a period as long as a century. Theoretically, besides the amenity of offering improved access, there are a range of transport-related disamenities, including congestion, pollution, and noise, which can affect outcomes such as productivity, health, and annoyance levels (Navrud, 2002). Our focus on accessibility and noise effects is driven by the empirical setting we exploit. We choose to evaluate land price capitalization effects of metro rail (====) in Berlin, Germany, due to the availability of historical and contemporary property data and a transport technology that has remained approximately constant since the system's inauguration in 1902. The system is fully electrified and has exclusive right-of-way, such that the effects on pollution and road congestion are rather negligible. We find little evidence for a negative view effect, so that noise from the elevated parts of the system is arguably the primary disamenity. Our property data covers commercial and residential property; therefore, our estimated capitalization effects reflect productivity and (dis)utility effects. They likely exclude health effects given that the public awareness of noise-induced health impacts is limited (Navrud, 2002). In line with the worldwide trend, real income in Germany has increased at a rate of 2% per year since 1900, accumulating to an overall increase of about 650%.==== Our setting, thus, allows us to compare the valuation of rail access and rail noise on real estate markets in a historical low-income scenario and a contemporary high-income scenario.====Our contribution is facilitated by a rather unique combination of suitable micro-geographic data at the turns of the 19th (1881–1914) and the 20th centuries (1990–2012). For our analyses, we digitize a series of historical maps, compiled by the chartered surveyor Gustav Müller, which provide information on land prices as detailed as to the level of individual parcels.==== We complement these historical data with a confidential contemporary micro data set covering a complete record of property transactions. With these data at hand, we estimate that over the course of the 20th century, the land price capitalization effect of a 10-dB decrease in rail noise increased from 4.2% to 13.0%. Accounting for the increase in the share of land in the value of housing over the same period, we infer a capitalization effect in house-price terms that increased from 1% to 4%. The land price capitalization effect of a 1-km reduction in distance from the nearest metro rail station, a measure that captures the value of the associated walking time (Gibbons and Machin, 2005), decreased from 20.2% to 15.5%. However, because the land share increased substantially over the same period, this decrease implies a sizable increase, from 3.6% to 5.0%, in terms of house-price capitalization.====These results suggest that the value attached to rail access and even more so to the disamenity from rail noise has increased over time. One interpretation is that access and a quiet environment are luxury goods on which recent generations are willing to spend more as they are richer. Making admittedly strong assumptions, we use our estimated capitalization effects to derive novel estimates of the long-run income elasticities of the amenity value of accessibility and the disamenity value of noise of 1.4 and 2.2, respectively. While we acknowledge that significant uncertainty surrounds these estimates, on balance they likely represent lower bounds, as we will explain below.====On top of these main insights, we contribute to the literature in several more specific respects. First, we contribute to a vast literature in the tradition of Oates (1969), that has inferred the value of non-marketed goods from house price capitalization, including clean air (Chay and Greenstone, 2005; Hanna, 2007), health risk (Currie et al., 2015; Davis, 2004), proximity to hazardous waste sites (Greenstone and Gallagher, 2008) or nuclear power plants (Tanaka and Zabel, 2018), crime risk (Linden and Rockoff, 2008), public school quality (Cellini et al., 2010), energy efficiency (Walls et al., 2017), aircraft noise (Boes and Nüesch, 2011; Ahlfeldt and Maennig, 2015), road noise (Graevenitz, 2018), wind farms (Gibbons, 2015) or transport access (Gibbons and Machin, 2005). We add to this literature by showing that within the same spatial context, capitalization effects of the same (dis)amenities can vary sizably in the long-run due to changes in consumer preferences.====Second, we enrich a literature on rail access capitalization effects that has recently shifted from the use of cross-sectional variation to the use of variation over time to improve identification (see Dubé et al., 2013 and appendix section 2 for a review). We expand on this line of research by proposing a novel weighted difference-in-differences (DD) estimator, which minimizes the conditional correlation between pre-announcement trends in the outcome variable (land prices) and multiple continuous treatment variables (proximity to the station and rail noise). Consequently, we minimize the risk that unobserved ==== in property prices correlated with station access or rail noise confound our estimates.====Third, we also add to a literature on noise capitalization effects that, with few exceptions concerning the analysis of aircraft noise (Ahlfeldt and Maennig, 2015; Boes and Nüesch, 2011), has employed cross-sectional designs. The literature on rail noise effects is particularly underdeveloped (see Navrud, 2002 and appendix section 2 for a review). Our spatially highly disaggregated, micro-geographic data sets allow us to exploit the relatively sharp change in rail noise that arises where a track enters a tunnel to vanish beneath the surface, a source of variation that has not been previously exploited in the literature. The spatial differencing (SD) approach used to assess the causal effect of noise on the price of adjacent land parcels in our contemporary analyses represent an improvement in terms of identification compared to the extant literature. Our novel estimate of the effect of a 1-dB increase in rail noise on house prices of −0.4% is close to recent estimates pointing to an aircraft noise effect of −0.5% to −0.6% (Ahlfeldt and Maennig, 2015; Boes and Nüesch, 2011) and a road noise effect of −0.1% to −1.4% (Graevenitz, 2018; Nelson, 2008 reports a central estimate of −0.57%).====Fourth, we explicitly disentangle the positive effects of rail access from the negative effects of rail noise in a causal analysis of rail capitalization effects. Therefore, we go beyond most of the existing work that typically focuses on the aggregate (or net) effect of countervailing rail externalities. In doing so, we also examine the degree of bias that arises when accessibility effects are estimated without controlling for noise effects and vice versa.====Fifth, we provide one of the few analyses of rail capitalization effects on land prices (e.g. Ahlfeldt et al., 2015a, Ahlfeldt et al., 2015b; Coffman and Gregson, 1998), whereas most previous studies have looked at price responses of properties or housing units. The analysis of land prices comes with the advantage of not having to control for structural characteristics. In addition, because land is scarce in an urban context and provided (almost) inelastically, adjustments in land prices can be assumed to be purely driven by demand. The analysis of house price effects, in contrast, may be mitigated by supply responses if the demand curve is locally downward sloping because of imperfect mobility and idiosyncratic location preferences (Hilber and Vermeulen 2015).====Last but not least, we provide a case study which illustrates that, due to the increase in noise aversion, the case for the construction of underground metro rail as opposed to elevated metro rail is much stronger today than in the past. In doing so, we also provide novel auxiliary findings that are interesting in their own right. We estimate the per-kilometer cost of an underground metro line at the beginning of the 20th century to be three times that of an elevated line, which is substantially larger than the contemporary rule-of-thumb factor of two. We also find that, over a period of about 130 years, the average annual nominal land price growth rate was about 5% in Berlin and, therefore, typically within the range of the opportunity cost of capital (central bank interest rates).====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss the context of our study, present our data, and introduce a simple theoretical framework that will guide the interpretation of the parameters we estimate. Section 3 presents the historical analysis, followed by the contemporary analysis in Section 4. In Section 5, we relate the historical and contemporary estimates to each other and discuss policy implications.

The 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is an exogenous event that affected the coastal counties of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi.====Recent research suggests that pregnant women, infants, and children are at a higher risk of adverse health impacts due to pollution (e.g. Currie and Neidell (2005) and Janke (2014)). Using air quality data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), infant health data from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), and a difference-in-difference methodology, this paper aims to investigate the impact of the oil spill on air quality (PM2.5, NO2, SO2 and CO) and on infant health outcomes (birth weight, low birth weight incidence, gestation in weeks, and premature newborn incidence). We find that the 2010 oil spill and cleanup activities increased concentrations of PM2.5, NO2, SO2, and CO. We also find that the oil spill increased the incidence of low birth weight (<2500g) by 0.010, and the incidence of prematurely born infants(<37 weeks of gestation) by 0.009.==== These outcomes have been shown to be good measures of infant health and have long term consequences on cognitive development (e.g. Black et al. (2007), Figlio et al. (2014), and Sanders (2012)).====We distinguish the impact for mothers already pregnant at the moment of the oil spill from mothers who subsequently became pregnant, and find similar impacts. Heterogeneity effects reveal more pronounced adverse infant health outcomes for mothers who are black, Hispanic, less educated, unmarried, and younger. The results have important policy implications as certain mothers are more affected by the pollution shock. This suggests that certain mothers can successfully apply measures to mitigate the negative impacts of pollution and that resources and information should be targeted toward pregnant women in the aftermath of an environmental disaster to help prevent poor infant health outcomes. Simple actions can be implemented to mitigate negative impacts of pollution. Exposure to air pollution can be reduced by staying indoors, reducing outdoor air infiltration to indoors, cleaning indoor air using air filters, and limiting physical activities, especially outdoors and near air pollution sources (e.g. Laumbach et al. (2015) and Sbihi et al. (2016)). The environmental literature emphasize the negative impact of the cleanup activities and dispersants on pollution following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill (e.g. Afshar-Mohajer et al. (2018) and De Gouw et al. (2011)). Recent research have also shown ineffective use of dispersant after the Deephorizon oil spill (e.g. Paris et al. (2018)). Our results also have implications regarding how cleanup activities are conducted and the importance of minimizing pollution and negative health effects for infants.====Our results are robust to a wide range of specifications and robustness checks such as: instrumental variable estimations, different control groups (such as propensity score matching), placebo estimations and controls, including the county's monthly average employment and wages.

Salt marshes exemplify such a system. Marsh sustainability under rapid sea level rise requires the preservation of transgression zones - undeveloped uplands onto which marshes migrate. Whether these uplands eventually become marsh depends on uncertain sea level rise and natural dynamics that determine migration onto different land types. Under conditions such as these, systematically diversified management actions generally outperform ad hoc or non-diversified alternatives. This paper develops the first adaptation portfolio model designed to optimize the benefits of a migrating coastal system. Results are illustrated using a case study of marsh conservation in Virginia, USA. Results suggest that models of this type can enhance adaptation benefits beyond those available through current approaches.","The sustainability of dynamic natural systems often depends on their capacity to adapt to climate-related changes. The uncertainties associated with such changes and the effect of management responses pose challenges for economic analysis and decision-making (Ando and Mallory, 2012; Heal and Millner, 2014; LaRiviere et al., 2018; Newbold and Marten, 2014; Pindyck, 2007). Migrating coastal systems such as salt marshes exemplify the type of dynamics for which climate-related uncertainty is relevant for management. Salt marshes are regularly flooded intertidal habitats that provide multiple ecological functions (Vernberg, 1993). The value of these systems is well established and has been recognized as an important motivation for coastal management (Barbier et al., 2011, 2013; Gopalakrishnan et al., 2018; Interis and Petrolia, 2016; Johnston et al., 2002a,b, 2005; Milon and Scrogin, 2006; Petrolia et al., 2014). Until recently salt marshes have been largely resilient to changes in sea level due to natural adjustments in elevation via vegetation growth and sediment accretion, and by migrating landward as sea levels rise (Kirwan et al., 2010, 2016a). However, there is now widespread concern about the loss of marsh benefits given the accelerated and uncertain rise in sea level, with regional and global analyses forecasting a 20–45==== marsh loss by 2100 (Craft et al., 2009; McFadden et al., 2007).====Efforts to sustain salt marshes typically emphasize the preservation of transgression zones—undeveloped uplands onto which marshes can migrate landward as sea levels rise. Given limits in the extent to which marshes can build elevation naturally, the preservation of these zones—often via fee-simple purchase by conservation organizations—is necessary to ensure marsh persistence in many areas (Enwright et al., 2016; Field et al., 2017; Kirwan and Megonigal, 2013; Kirwan et al., 2016b; Torio and Chmura, 2013). The extent to which preserved transgression zones eventually become marsh, however, depends on uncertain future sea level rise (SLR) and natural dynamics that determine when and where marshes migrate (Enwright et al., 2016; Feagin et al., 2010; Kirwan et al., 2016b; Smith, 2013). Different types of transgression zones, e.g., different land types at different elevations and/or locations, will hence differ in their expected productivity of future marsh “supply,” where this dynamic productivity is subject to uncertainty. For example, preserving low-elevation land at marsh edges may allow marsh migration at low SLR, but will be ineffective at high SLR, which causes these low-lying areas to submerge or drown. Preserving higher-elevation land will be ineffective at low SLR (because these areas remain above the marsh edge), but can enable migration at high SLR.====Because the tendency of marshes to migrate onto different types of preserved upland depends on uncertain SLR, systematic diversification of this preservation offers a potential means to enhance management benefits. This reflects the capacity of diversified approaches to hedge against risk (Ando and Mallory, 2012). Insufficiently diversified preservation increases the risk that marshes and their benefits will decline or even vanish, despite efforts to ensure marsh migration. Optimal diversification can minimize such risks, much as it does in financial portfolios (Markowitz, 1952; Merton, 1969, 1971). The potential benefits of diversification are further evident if one recognizes that decision-makers are often risk averse (Berrens, 2001; Holt and Laury, 2002).====Despite recognition of concepts related to asset diversification within economics and the relevance of uncertainty for decision-making, optimal portfolio models are relatively sparse within environmental economics. Nonetheless, this literature demonstrates that often substantial gains are available through systematic treatment of diversification. For example, Ando and Mallory (2012) demonstrate the benefits of optimal portfolio design for habitat conservation subject to climate-related uncertainty (cf. Mallory and Ando, 2014; Shah and Ando, 2015). Sanchirico et al. (2008) find similar benefits within ecosystem-based fishery management. Leroux and Martin (2016) and Leroux et al. (2018) demonstrate the advantages of optimal water supply portfolios. Related work by van ’t Veld and Plantinga (2005) finds that optimal portfolios of greenhouse-gas mitigation depend on carbon-price paths.==== Yet while the capacity to reduce risk via hedging can have first-order implications for management (LaRiviere et al., 2018), economic analyses of conservation decisions rarely capitalize on the insights available from portfolio theory. Moreover, we are aware of no economic model able to inform management diversification of this type for dynamic, migrating coastal systems such as salt marshes.====This paper develops the first portfolio model designed to optimize the benefits of a migrating coastal system. The model focuses on the diversification of transgression zone investments to maximize marsh conservation benefits, while hedging risk across transgression zone types. The model also provides insight into how diversification can be adapted to address factors such as differing SLR expectations and preservation additionality, among other features. Unlike most diversification models in the environmental literature that derive empirical solutions using modern portfolio theory (Markowitz, 1952; e.g., Ando and Mallory, 2012; Mallory and Ando, 2014; Sanchirico et al., 2008), here we develop a dynamic model following Merton (1969, 1971) that provides closed-form analytical solutions (Bretschger and Vinogradova, 2017; Leroux and Martin, 2016, Leroux et al., 2018).==== An empirical illustration is provided using an application to the Virginia Coast Reserve Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) site on the Eastern Shore of Virginia, USA, focusing on portfolios that preserve agricultural land, forest land and intertidal land with established marsh. Our empirical results point to the benefits of emphasizing a particular land type for marsh transgression (higher-elevation agricultural land) that currently represents only a small portion of coastal conservation portfolios. The underlying biophysical model accounts for the dynamic nature of salt marsh geomorphology via a spatial, dynamic, process-based approach. Although we develop the model for marshes, it may be adapted to other systems whose sustainability depends on migration, including beaches, dunes and mangroves (Barbier et al., 2011; Gopalakrishnan et al., 2018; Millar et al., 2007; Parsons et al., 2013).",Coastal dynamics and adaptation to uncertain sea level rise: Optimal portfolios for salt marsh migration,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069618304248,14 September 2019,2019,Research Article,279.0

We examine the dynamics of moral behaviors and land congestion when the prevalence of different types evolves over time following a vertical/oblique socialization process à la Bisin and Verdier (2001). We study the impact of a quota and of a ==== on the congestion of land, and we show that introducing a quota may, in some cases, reduce the proportion of Kantians, and worsen the Tragedy of the Commons with respect to the laissez-faire. Ignoring the dynamics of moral traits may lead governments to implement policies that make the Tragedy worse than at the laissez-faire, even though such policies would work well for a fixed population composition.","Popularized by Harding (1968), the Tragedy of the Commons refers to a general class of situations where a common resource is overused by individuals who do not, when making their decisions, internalize the negative impact of their decisions on others’ interests. The standard example consists of an economy of shepherds deciding how many sheep they let graze on the same common (unregulated) parcel of land. Each shepherd may not fully internalize the negative effect of raising the number of sheep on the output of other shepherds. As a consequence, the land is congested, the return per sheep is low, and there is an aggregate under-supply of output. This situation is not Pareto efficient.====The overuse of a common resource has been widely tested in experiments through common pool resource games.==== The theoretical prediction of those games is that each player plays Nash, and extracts as much common resource as he can. However, although outcomes of common pool resource games vary depending on the particular rules of the game, experimental evidence shows that a significant proportion of players extract ==== than what Nash players maximizing their own payoffs would extract.====A possible explanation for that paradoxical result may be that players play Nash, but exhibit inequality aversion, as in Fehr and Schmidt (1999). Another explanation is that the concept of Nash equilibrium is not adequate to describe how individuals behave. As an alternative, Rabin (1993) developed the concept of fairness equilibrium, i.e. a set of strategies and beliefs on other player's intentions such that (i) each player plays the best reply to the other players strategies given his beliefs on other players' intentions; (ii) those beliefs are actually verified. Alternatively, Laffont (1975) and, more recently, Roemer (2010), introduced the concept of Kantian rationality, which consists in choosing not the best strategy for oneself, but the best ==== strategy, i.e. the best strategy if everyone played it as well.====The coexistence of diverse forms of rationality when facing the Tragedy of the Commons raises several questions. First, is the presence of non-Nash rationality a purely temporary phenomenon? Will non-Nash players become extinct in the long-run? A second question concerns the ways in which governments can intervene to make the Tragedy less worse. How can public policies (e.g. quotas and taxes) reduce land congestion once various forms of rationality coexist?====In this paper, we revisit the Tragedy of the Commons in a dynamic economy composed of Nash and Kantian players. We propose to study the joint dynamics of land congestion and moral behaviors, to explore whether standard policies (quotas and taxes) can still achieve their goal of reducing land congestion in an economy whose partition into Nash and Kantian players varies over time, and is affected by those policies.====To this end, we develop a two-period overlapping generations model (OLG) composed of a population of shepherds, who decide how many sheep they let graze on a common parcel of land, while relying on different forms of rationality (Nash players and Kantian players). In line with the literature, the more sheep a shepherd has, the lower is the available land for each sheep, which reduces the output per sheep.====Moral behaviors are transmitted through a cultural transmission process à la Bisin and Verdier (2001) where the evolution of cultural traits is the result of family socialization actions and role modeling within the society. In that setting, parents can influence the probability to transmit their trait (here their rationality, Nash or Kantian) to their offspring, motivated by a form of imperfect altruism (i.e.,‘imperfect empathy’). The dynamics of moral traits thus depends on parental socialization efforts which are functions of the socio-economic conditions.====The key insight is that land congestion and the population composition in terms of moral behaviors are co-determined. In that framework, we first examine the existence and uniqueness of the temporary equilibrium: the equilibrium of the common pool resource game at a given period of time when the population includes both Kantian and Nash players. Then, when studying the dynamics of heterogeneity induced by our socialization framework, we examine long-run equilibria. We obtain three main results. First, we show that, at the laissez-faire, Kantians survive in the long-run for any initial distribution of cultural traits. This result is in line with the evolutionary game theory literature showing that cooperative behaviors can survive in the long-run (Alger and Weibull, 2013; 2016a). In our framework, this result is due to the endogenous response of parents (i.e., socialization efforts) who care for their child.==== Our second result and main contribution is to show that introducing a quota on the number of sheep per shepherd may, in some cases, worsen the Tragedy of the Commons, by reinforcing the congestion of land. Even though quotas reduce land congestion at period ====, they may have a negative dynamic effect by lowering moral behaviors. In particular, weak quotas make Nash children better off which encourages Nash parents (resp. Kantian) to increase (resp. decrease) their socialization effort to transmit the Nash (resp. Kantian) trait. This unintended extensive margin effect sometimes outweighs the desired intensive margin effect which results in a rise in the aggregate number of animals in the long-run. We also examine the impact of a Pigouvian tax. Numerically, we find that unlike the quota, the monetary instrument fosters moral behaviors in the long-run. That is, monetary incentives crowd in while direct regulation crowds out moral behaviors. This qualitative change in the impact of the public policy can be rationalized as follows. The quota directly reduces the number of animals which, in the present framework, translates into a rise in the productivity per animal. This rise benefits more to agents who choose a higher number of animals, i.e., Nash players. This in turn strengthens socialization to Nash behaviors. By contrast, the tax indirectly regulates the total number of animals by affecting the cost of purchasing animals. As a consequence, there are two opposite effects affecting socialization to the Nash trait. As for the quota, there is a positive effect due to the rise in average productivity. However, there is an additional negative effect since the rise in the cost per animal negatively impacts individuals who choose more animals, that is Nash players. Overall, numerical simulations suggest that the second negative effect outweighs the first one so that the tax fosters Kantian morality.==== Thus, in a world with strong political constraints, the tax performs better than the quota.====In the light of those results, this paper reexamines the Tragedy of the Commons by highlighting the interactions between land congestion, public policy and moral behaviors within a dynamic model of socialization and cultural transmission. As such, it casts some light on various real-world situations which share, with our stylized model, some salient characteristics. First, the cultural transmission of Kantian morality is in line with recent field experiments showing persistent differences in pro-social behaviors among different societies. Henrich et al. (2001, 2005) realize a large cross-cultural study using ultimatum, public good, and dictator games. Subjects come from 15 small-scale societies (in Africa, Asia and South America) exhibiting a wide variety of economic and social conditions (hunt-gatherers, herders, farmers). They find substantial differences in cooperative behaviors across societies (in particular there is much more variability across groups than within groups). Second, our theory is consistent with empirical evidence suggesting that economic structures with different incentives produce different pro-social behaviors in the long-run. A study conducted by Talhelm et al. (2014) reveals that current differences in individualistic values among Han Chinese have been shaped by distinct historical patterns of crop cultivation among Chinese provinces. More precisely, they find that in rice-growing southern provinces, which required intense cooperation (because of a need of elaborated irrigation networks and massive labor requirements), individuals are significantly less individualistic than in the wheat-growing north. Another piece of evidence comes from Henrich et al. (2005), who find that the higher the degree of market integration of one society, the higher the return to cooperation and the greater the expressed level of pro-sociality as measured by the generosity of offers and the refusal of unfair offers. Third, our paper, which examines how intrinsic motivations can conflict with policy intervention, can cast some light on case studies provided by Ostrom (2000). In long-surviving irrigation systems, Bardhan (1999) finds that the quality of maintenance of irrigation canals is lower in systems where irrigation rules have been enforced by a local government. In all of the villages where a government agency decides how water is to be allocated and distributed, farmers have a more negative attitude about the water allocation rules and they tend to contribute less to the local village fund. This is in line with our result showing that in some cases policy crowds out pro-social behaviors in the long-run.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 surveys the related literature. The model is presented in Section 3, which characterizes also the temporary equilibrium (under different possible distributions of moral traits). Section 4 studies the long-run dynamics of moral behaviors. The impact of introducing a quota on the dynamics of moral behaviors and on land congestion is examined in Section 5. Section 6 studies the influence of a Pigouvian tax on land congestion. Section 7 examines the robustness of our results to alternative frameworks.

This approach to modeling the effects of uncertainty is incomplete. When there is uncertainty about how firms will respond to a policy we should expect the realized environmental quality will also be uncertain regardless of the instrument that is selected. None of the benefit analyses for evaluating a new policy take account of the fact that when the outcomes of that intervention are uncertain, the benefit measures attributed to the policy will be different from what are conventionally used in benefit cost analyses.====A recent example of the importance of uncertainty in policy outcomes can be found in Cropper et al's (2017) comparison of the estimates from EPA's Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) of the 1998 Cluster Rule, designed to reduce hazardous air and water pollutants from pulp and paper mills, with what was realized. They note that the RIA's predicted reductions in chloroform were largely achieved, but other toxic air pollutants experienced reductions that were half of what was predicted and there was no reduction in PM10====. More generally, when analysts consider the outcomes of policy using monitored levels of air pollution they find significant variability in what is realized. For example, Brajer et al., (2010) note that between 2005 and 2007 in Southern California the 8 h ozone standard was exceeded about one third of the time somewhere in the region, despite an aggressive program of regulation that was expected to assure the standard would be met.====Fowlie and Muller (2017) have also documented how differences in what is known about abatement costs ==== versus what is realized ==== can impact the welfare properties attributed to different policy instruments. Using Muller (2011) AP2 model, along with engineering estimates of source specific and technology specific abatement costs, they compare differentiated tradeable emission permits with undifferentiated permits for EPA's NO==== Budget Program (NBP)====. Their analysis assumes perfect compliance by the electric generating plants subject to the rule. Even with this ideal adherence to the regulation, they find the difference between plants' ==== observed compliance choices and the decisions that would minimize the ==== compliance costs were sufficient to undermine any theoretical preference for differentiated emission trading policies. When regulators do not have knowledge of the intra-source distribution of marginal costs, policies based on ==== engineering estimates of them can lead to markedly different outcomes than what is realized ====. While the Fowlie and Muller analysis uses a simple description of the damage function for NO====, the AP2 model does incorporate estimation uncertainty for the key parameters leading to the model's marginal damage estimates. All of the benefit measures in these analyses assume people do not recognize the potential for uncertainty in the outcomes of policy====. This assumption is inconsistent with what has been learned from several studies of households' avoidance behavior. Graff Zivin and Neidell (2009), for example, found the behavioral dynamics of responses to smog alerts depend on the pattern of alerts and can be interpreted as a response to the uncertain air quality conditions.====We develop a simple index of the bias arising when the environmental quality improvement from policy is uncertain. Two cases are considered. The first assumes the baseline level of environmental quality is not random and that only the level of quality realized with a new policy is random. The second case treats both the baseline and level arising from policy as random.====Our analysis develops a second order approximation for a welfare measure that is interpreted differently depending on the description of the policy context. For the first case, where only the outcome of policy is uncertain, our measure is an approximation for the certainty equivalent. We can distinguish two parts of this measure. The first is the second order approximation for the Hicksian equivalent surplus for a certain (non-stochastic) increase in the environmental service associated with a policy. The second is a term reflecting the adjustment a consumer would require to this conventional measure due to the effects of uncertainty in the outcome of that policy. When there is uncertainty about both the baseline and the outcome from policy we define an option price. Our expression is a second order approximation that distinguishes the conventional surplus measure and includes the term reflecting the uncertainty which, in this case, depends on the magnitude of the variance in baseline compared to the variance in the post policy conditions. The general form of our index is ==== affected by the definition we adopt for the welfare measure –whether certainty equivalent or willingness to pay in the case of one random variable or the equivalent and compensating definitions for the option price when both baseline and policy outcomes are random variables. There is the conventional difference between equivalent and compensating definitions and the associated welfare measures for our cases as a result of income effects.====This extension is important because it distinguishes risk aversion arising from uncertainty in the public good from risk aversion arising from income uncertainty. With non-separable preferences, the ability to adjust the consumption levels of private goods in response to different levels of the quasi-fixed environmental service affects how the two types of aversion are related. Our compensation measure describes how this connection, together with private adaptation, influences the importance of uncertainty in the amount of the environmental public good. In addition, the assumption of non-separable preferences allows measureable features of individual demand to be used to characterize individual attitudes toward uncertainty in the amount of the quasi-fixed, environmental good.====To offer a “back of the envelope” estimate of what our index would imply for the potential importance of uncertainty in what environmental policy is able to provide, we use the case of a certain baseline and an uncertain policy outcome. We begin with the Currie and Neidell (2005) estimates for the within zip code/month variance in ozone for Southern California, together with the reduction in the 8 h ozone concentrations as our indication of an air quality policy outcome. Our index of the importance of uncertain environmental services uses a measure of compensation relative to the amount of virtual income due to the improved level of the environmental good. With approximate estimates of demand and income elasticities for environmental services as well as for the coefficient of relative risk aversion from the literature, our index of the importance of uncertainty would call for ==== benefit measures for this improvement in ozone relative to this contribution to virtual income, by approximately ten percent.====Section two describes how the benefits from improvements in environmental quality are commonly estimated and provides a selective summary of the past treatment of uncertainty in these analyses. The third section derives our index of the importance of people's responses to uncertainty in environmental services. The last section sketches the details for our back-of-the-envelope calculation. It also discusses some next steps for considering how the uncertainty in policy outcomes can be included in the benefits measures used in benefit cost analysis.",The welfare cost of uncertainty in policy outcomes,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069619300476,12 September 2019,2019,Research Article,281.0

Working in the random utility framework, we develop a structural model that describes both demand for recreational trips to the landscape's quality-differentiated natural areas and preferences over different landscape-wide patterns of ==== elicited in a choice experiment. The structural coherence of the model ensures that the parameters of the preference function can be simultaneously estimated from the combination of revealed and stated preference data. We explore the properties of the model in a Monte Carlo experiment and then apply it to a study of preferences for changes in the ecological quality of rivers in northern England. This implementation reveals plausible estimates of the use and nonuse parameters of the model and provides insights into the distance decay in those two different forms of value.","The problem addressed by this paper concerns the appraisal of programmes or policies whose environmental impacts are not constrained to a particular site but which have widespread yet spatially-differentiated impacts across a landscape. Our motivating example concerns a programme designed to improve the ecological status of a region's rivers,==== a change that delivers benefit flows not only through improved recreational experiences at riverside sites but also, potentially, through increased nonuse value.====Valuing a programme that delivers a simultaneous change in the quality of natural areas across a landscape presents a significantly more complex challenge than the single-site appraisal problem. With respect to recreational use, perhaps, the most significant of those challenges is in understanding how individuals assess the value of a landscape offering a multiplicity of recreational opportunities. In the recreational demand literature, that problem is most frequently approached through adoption of the discrete choice travel cost (TC) method, a revealed preference (RP) approach that derives estimates of value from examination of recreational choice behaviour. Discrete choice TC modelling is theoretically underpinned by the random utility maximisation (RUM) model (McFadden, 1973) which formally defines the structure of individuals’ preferences and the process through which individuals choose which of the set of quality-differentiated recreational destinations to visit. Armed with estimates of the preference function derived from a clear structural model of behaviour, TC analysts can explore the potential welfare consequences that might arise should environmental quality change in a variety of different ways across any number of sites in a landscape.====While the discrete-choice TC model has many advantages it also has shortcomings. One obvious shortcoming is that the technique is unable to estimate value derived from nonuse. Moreover, reliance on observed behaviour may result in problems of identification, for example, when the range of current qualities fails to cover that to be evaluated under the proposed programme. An alternative method that addresses both those shortcomings is provided by stated preference (SP) methods of valuation.====In theory, an SP approach could generate data that would allow identification of both use and nonuse values for any desired pattern of environmental quality change. Realising that outcome is, of course, more difficult. One problem concerns how to convey to respondents the complex spatial reality of the landscape within which hypothetical changes in environmental quality occur. As we discuss further in Section 2, here we champion the use of ====s (VSCEs), an SP elicitation method in which respondents are asked to choose between policy options presented to them in the form of maps displaying the environmental quality delivered by a policy at each location in the landscape. This use of spatial visualisation provides a mechanism whereby complex differences in the spatial organisation of supply under different policy options can be conveyed to respondents in a simple and accessible manner.====A second complexity, concerns analysis of responses to SP exercises like the VSCE. The particular difficulty here is that the preferences underpinning those responses reflect value in use and nonuse and are shaped by the substitution possibilities afforded by the diversity of natural areas present in a landscape. As we describe in Section 2, to date, the analysis of SP data has failed to convincingly address these complexities. Analysts have tended to forego the formality of structural modelling relying instead on highly reduced-form specifications which confound use and nonuse value and address issues of spatial location and substitution through estimation of ‘distance-decay’ parameters and broad indices of substitute availability and quality.====The core contribution of this paper is to propose an estimation strategy that directly addresses these issues. In Section 3 we describe a formulation for the preference function that captures both use and nonuse values. Moreover we show how within the RUM framework, that specification can be developed into a coherent structural model of choice behaviour that not only describes respondents’ observed recreational activity but also their choices in a VSCE exercise. Indeed, one significant advantage of our approach is that it results in econometric specifications for both observed recreational behaviour and VSCE responses that are derived from the same structural model. This common derivation has the added benefit of allowing RP and SP data to simultaneously inform estimation of the same structural parameters.====As we describe in Section 4, deriving our econometric specification from a structural model, results in a preference function that is nonlinear in the structural parameters. Moreover, unlike most previous applications of the RUM approach, our structurally-derived model results in error terms that are sums of independent logistic variates. Given these complexities, in Section 5, we present the results of a Monte Carlo experiment in which we explore the circumstances under which the model can successfully recover estimates of the preference parameters. Finally, in Section 6, we estimate the model in the context of a real data set collected in a large scale survey carried out across Northern England. This implementation reveals intuitively plausible estimates of the use and nonuse parameters of the model and provides interesting insights into the distance decay in those two different forms of value.====As we describe in detail in the next section, our paper makes contributions to a number of literatures. Primarily, it makes a contribution to the field of structural econometric modelling in environmental economics (Timmins and Schlenker, 2009). As far as the authors are aware, we provide the first attempt to underpin the analysis of non-market valuation data for landscapes of quality-differentiated sites with a coherent structural description of use and nonuse value. In that way, our approach builds on the structurally-coherent model developed by Eom and Larson (2006) to explore use and nonuse values in the single site setting. Moreover, in providing a new approach to the simultaneous analysis of TC and CE data, our work makes a novel contribution to the literature on the combined analysis of RP and SP data (Whitehead et al., 2008). Our paper is also of interest to the field of discrete choice modelling, presenting as it does a RUM specification not previously explored in the literature. Finally, our research contributes to SP research by showing how issues of distance decay, substitute location and quality as well as use and nonuse value can be coherently addressed through utility-theoretic modelling of preferences.",Structurally-consistent estimation of use and nonuse values for landscape-wide environmental change,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069617301419,6 September 2019,2019,Research Article,282.0

Technological improvements are also a vital tool for reducing environmental damage from consumption. However, their benefits are partially offset by the direct rebound effect, whereby a consumer rationally responds to an increase in resource use efficiency by consuming more. This paper investigates whether technological improvement might also reduce behaviorally motivated mitigation of environmental damage. A behavioral rebound effect operates through two channels. First, pro-environmental effort is reduced after a decrease in marginal environmental damage. Second, moral licensing reduces pro-environmental effort further when technological change is endogenous. I develop a novel real effort laboratory experiment to identify these behaviors. I find a positive behavioral rebound effect. I also find evidence consistent with moral licensing, which is strongest among subjects with a higher degree of pro-environmental attitudes and beliefs. Subjects’ baseline level of pro-environmental effort is driven by beliefs about social norms.","Many individuals utilize pro-environmental behaviors to reduce their environmental impact. These behaviors can include everything from bicycling and reducing time in the shower, to recycling and refusing plastic bags. Indeed, environmental campaigners, corporations, governments and economists all understand that individuals have pro-environmental preferences, a desire to maintain self-image and moral balance, and a proclivity to follow social norms, all of which can lead to pro-environmental behaviors (Cason and Gangadharan, 2002; Croson and Treich, 2014; DEFRA, 2008). Naturally, technological improvement is also vital for addressing environmental issues ranging from water shortages to climate change (Duarte et al., 2014; The Global Commission on the Economy and Climate, 2014). While these channels for mitigating environmental impacts may seem ==== complementary, technological change may have negative implications for pro-environmental behaviors, akin to the rebound effect in consumption (Chan and Kotchen, 2014; Gans and Groves, 2012).====Indeed, the reduction in environmental damage from technological improvement is partially offset by the rebound effect (De Borger et al., 2016; Gillingham et al., 2016; Sorrell et al., 2009). That is, a consumer rationally responds to an improvement in efficiency in the use of resources such as energy and water by consuming more (Chan and Gillingham, 2015; Gillingham et al., 2016; Xie and Zilberman, 2018). The rebound effect is modeled in the literature as a result of standard income and substitution effects in response to a reduction in the cost of consumption (Chan and Gillingham, 2015). However, there exists a behavioral route by which technological change could lead to a rebound, through its effect on the incentives to undertake pro-environmental behaviors. For example, moving to a more efficient car decreases the relative environmental benefit of walking and cycling, thus reducing the pro-environmental incentives for not driving. Additionally, moral licensing (defined below) could increase the size of such a behavioral rebound whenever a technology improvement has been consciously chosen by the individual. Thus, a behavioral rebound effect needs to be taken into account when considering the impact of technological change on environmental damage, or indeed the ability of environmental organizations to encourage pro-environmental action.====The main aim of this paper is to investigate the existence of a behavioral rebound effect and whether improvements in technology are also subject to moral licensing. I define the behavioral rebound effect as any increase in environmental damage from a decrease in pro-environmental behaviors and increase in consumption, following a decrease in marginal environmental damage from consumption. Pro-environmental behaviors are behaviors undertaken purely for environmental reasons, such as any walking or cycling done purely on environmental grounds and not for other benefits from these modes of transport, like fitness, enjoyment or saving money. Additionally, in this paper I am particularly interested in pro-environmental behaviors that mitigate environmental damage from consumption. Examples of this type of pro-environmental behaviors include cycling instead of driving, recycling, reducing power usage, catching the train instead of flying and so on. In all of these examples, the marginal damage from the brown technology determines in part how effective the pro-environmental behavior is at mitigating environmental damage from consumption, increasing the potential for a behavioral rebound effect after a reduction in the environmental impact of the brown technology.====The behavioral rebound effect is defined in relation to an exogenous decrease in marginal environmental damage from consumption. Moral licensing accounts for any additional reduction in pro-environmental effort due to an endogenous decrease in marginal environmental damage from consumption. Moral licensing is a behavioral phenomenon whereby individuals who undertake a moral action will subsequently behave in an immoral or unethical way (Blanken et al., 2015). Returning to the transport example, after an individual purchases a highly efficient car due to its environmental credentials, they may feel they have a license to no longer walk and cycle for certain trips. Thus, moral licensing has the potential to increase the size of the behavioral rebound effect in the presence of an endogenous decrease in marginal environmental damage.====I develop a novel real effort laboratory experiment to investigate the behavioral rebound effect and moral licensing. The experiment can cleanly isolate pro-environmental behaviors without the many confounds potentially present in the field, where pro-environmental behaviors like cycling may be done for other reasons too, such as enjoyment or saving money. Subjects must decide how to allocate their effort, in a real effort task, between earning money for themselves and avoiding damage to a tree planting charity. The experimental design is innovative; I am not aware of any similar fully incentivized laboratory experiments that measure responses to a consumption externality, which involves real world environmental damage and relative effort between two choices in a real effort task.==== I find pro-environmental effort does decrease with an exogenous decrease in marginal environmental damage of consumption, and thus there is a behavioral rebound effect. I also find some evidence of moral licensing when marginal environmental damage of consumption changes endogenously, particularly for individuals with a stronger pro-environmental orientation of their attitudes and beliefs. Finally, the main driver of pro-environmental effort is beliefs about social norms.====In the next section I review some background to this study. Section 3 follows with an outline of the method, starting with the theoretical framework, and concluding by describing the experiment and the hypotheses.

We use a national data set of vehicle registrations and state-level financial incentives to assess the impact of vehicle purchase subsidies on adoption using both difference-in-differences and synthetic controls methods. We find that incentives offered as direct purchase rebates generate increased levels of new BEV registrations at a rate of approximately 8 percent per thousand dollars of incentive offered. Between 2011 and 2015, vehicle rebate incentives are associated with an increase in overall BEV registrations of approximately 11 percent. Our findings indicate incentives offered as state income tax credits do not have a statistically significant effect on BEV adoptions, though we caution this may be a result of limited temporal variation in BEV incentives across our sample. Responses to rebate incentives do not differ significantly by the make of the vehicle purchased (i.e., Tesla and non-Tesla vehicles). We combine our results with recent assessments of marginal environmental costs of electric vehicle charging and measure net welfare effects of BEV subsidy programs. Our analysis indicates these programs are not welfare-improving if only considering benefits associated with avoided emissions. Additional benefits associated with long-term market growth, production cost savings, network externalities, or accelerated innovation could substantially impact the net welfare outcomes.","Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) represent a frontier of commercially-produced vehicle technology and are often promoted as an important component of efforts to reduce transportation-sector reliance on fossil fuels. Despite their advertised benefits, BEVs face barriers to adoption including high upfront costs relative to conventional vehicles and consumer apprehension about reliability, range, and unfamiliar technology (Hidrue et al., 2011; Egbue and Long, 2012). Each of these barriers arises from the fact that BEVs are a significant departure from traditional internal combustion engine technology. To overcome these barriers and promote adoption of alternative fuels vehicles, the Federal government and some entities at the state and local levels in the United States subsidize consumer BEV purchases.====Given the widespread availability of BEV incentive programs, the potentially high cost of offering incentives worth thousands of dollars per vehicle, and the unique attributes of the BEV market, it is important to understand consumer response to these subsidies and to quantify the benefits and costs of their implementation. Assessment of the impact of BEV subsidies is valuable for policymakers considering adoption of new programs or renewal of existing incentive schemes.==== Additionally, the results of our analysis can inform strategies for incentivizing future transportation technology innovation; the barriers to BEV adoption are similar to those faced by other emerging vehicle technologies (e.g., natural gas and hydrogen fuel cells) and represent more substantial hurdles than those encountered by other recent innovations in consumer automobile technology.====Our analysis uses BEV registration data and information about state BEV subsidies in the United States to quantify the impact of state-level financial incentives on BEV adoptions. We take advantage of heterogeneity in subsidy types and vehicle model offerings in our sample to explore various subsidy responses in the BEV market. Specifically, we examine i) whether consumer response depends on the type of incentive offered and ii) whether there is heterogeneity in response for adopters that purchase Tesla vehicles versus those that purchase other BEV models. Our analysis also provides suggestive evidence of the extent to which charging infrastructure and fuel costs (both gasoline and electricity) are correlated with BEV adoption, though our choice of empirical specification precludes definitive, causal interpretations of these results.====As one of the primary justifications for offering incentives to BEV adopters is a reduction in fossil-fuel emissions, we use our estimates to assess the economic efficiency of state BEV incentive programs.==== To do so, we combine our estimates of state-level incentive effects with the spatially detailed emissions damage estimates of Holland et al. (2016).====To assess efficacy of state-level BEV subsidies on consumer adoption, we employ a fixed-effects regression model and a national panel data set of vehicle registrations and state-level policies. We augment our primary analysis with an exploration of BEV incentive impacts using a synthetic controls approach. Our results indicate that state-level financial incentives increase BEV adoptions on the margin. Estimates suggest an increase in BEV registrations of 8% per thousand dollars of incentive offered, or, considering the total value of incentives, approximately an 11% increase in total BEV adoptions compared to the counterfactual scenario in the absence of state-level incentives. Assessing impacts by incentive type, we find significant, positive effects of direct purchase rebates. Tax credits are not revealed as strong drivers of new BEV registrations. However, when incentive effects are estimated as a share of total vehicle purchases, the effects of tax credits are positive and marginally significant. We hypothesize that the lack of a significant finding for tax credits may be the result of a limited number of states offering tax credits that vary in value over the study time period. We also estimate a version of the model that allows for differences in incentive effects by model type, focusing specifically on responses for Tesla purchases. Results indicate no difference in adoption responses to incentives between Tesla and non-Tesla buyers.====Total incentive effects are used in conjunction with environmental damage estimates to estimate program costs and net welfare impacts. We find that benefits in the form of avoided damages from vehicle emissions are not sufficient to outweigh the program and welfare costs of these policies. A sensitivity analysis of these results indicates that only in a setting with favorable assumptions about vehicle lifetimes and incentive uptake are state-level incentives welfare-improving when benefits are based solely on avoided environmental damage.====To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to isolate the impacts of state-level incentives on the rate of adoption of BEVs in the United States and to examine these effects by subsidy and model type. We are also the first to apply synthetic controls methods to this problem, mitigating concerns about violations of the parallel trends assumption that must hold for difference-in-difference estimation. Our results provide a detailed examination of state-level financial subsidy impacts that complements the findings of Li et al. (2017) regarding network effects in the electric vehicle market. The application of our findings to a state-level welfare analysis is the first to incorporate the detailed spatial damage estimates of Holland et al. (2016) to estimate net national welfare implications of state-level BEV policies.====Our analysis contributes to the current literature that explores the design and impact of incentives for advanced vehicle technologies. The number of studies that utilize historical data to analyze the BEV market is relatively small, as the market is newer and sales levels are lower than the markets for conventional vehicles and hybrids. DeShazo et al. (2017) conduct a stated-preference study of new car buyers in California and estimate that California's state-level rebate program can be credited with generating approximately 10,000 plug-in vehicles (i.e., BEVs and plug-in hybrids). This is a 7% increase in sales in the combined BEV and plug-in hybrid market, equivalent to a 0.2 percentage point increase in market share. Sierzchula et al. (2014) assemble cross-sectional data on BEV adoptions and relevant market characteristics from 30 countries in 2012 and estimate the impact of BEV incentives globally. The authors find that the presence of incentives and the availability of charging infrastructure have the most significant influence on BEV adoption levels across countries, though the magnitudes of both effects are small. With respect to subsidy impacts, the authors find a $1000 financial incentive increase corresponds to an EV market share increase of 0.06 percentage points. Point estimates also suggest that one vehicle charging station per 100,000 residents is associated with an EV market share increase of 0.12 percentage points.====The analysis of Li et al. (2017) explores the presence of network effects in the market for electric vehicles. The authors’ results suggest that incentive effects are magnified by feedback loops that arise from subsequent expansion of charging infrastructure. Taken together, these studies indicate subsidy policies have been effective in modifying electric vehicle adoption behavior. Our study extends this line of inquiry and examines whether responses differ across subsidy types or across vehicle models.====Our analysis also augments existing research on vehicle incentives based on the market for traditional hybrid vehicles. Incentive offerings in the hybrid market received substantial focus in the mid and late 2000s. Diamond (2009) finds that the increase in market share of hybrids in the United States between 2001 and 2009 was likely influenced by gasoline price increases during this period rather than by vehicle incentives.==== In contrast, analysis by Gallagher and Muehlegger (2011) yields significant, positive estimates of incentive effects. Gallagher and Muehlegger's results also suggest the magnitude of incentive impact varies based on the incentive's form; sales tax waivers are found to have a significant positive relationship with hybrid vehicle sales, while income tax credits are not. The authors hypothesize that their result is due to consumer discounting and the lag in receipt of income tax credit value. This finding is one impetus for our study and a similar finding in the BEV market could have implications for the design of programs, incentives, or other policies to support BEV adoption. Outside of the United States, Chandra et al. (2010) find support at the province level that tax rebate incentives influenced hybrid vehicle adoptions in Canada. The authors utilize within-province, temporal variation in tax rebates and hybrid sales across a broad time period (1989–2006) to identify hybrid vehicle market share increases on the order of 31–38 percent per 1000 Canadian dollars (34–42% per $1000 USD) of incentive.====Beresteanu and Li (2011) implement the methods of Berry et al. (1995) to assess hybrid vehicle demand based on the market share of hybrids in 22 metropolitan statistical areas nationally. Allowing for heterogeneous consumer preferences, the authors conclude that consumers prefer more fuel efficient vehicles and that the value of “local support” (i.e., HOV lane access and parking privileges) is not a significant driver of adoption.====We use the findings of these studies of the market for hybrids as a benchmark to inform our model. We modify our approach to account for differences in BEV and hybrid markets with respect to consumer perception, vehicle technology, infrastructure requirements, incentive offerings, and macroeconomic climate during initial commercialization. Our findings provide new evidence, in a unique and valuable market context, that state-level vehicle incentives can influence adoption of emerging vehicle technologies. Our results indicate that the incentive format may be an important factor in determining consumer response to BEV purchase subsidies, in line with the results of Gallagher and Muehlegger (2011). Our estimates of the implied costs of emissions reductions resulting from the subsidies corroborates prior findings that suggest that financial incentives for energy-efficient product adoption is a relatively expensive approach to reducing emissions when compared to alternative policies (Chandra et al., 2010; Beresteanu and Li, 2011; Knittel, 2009; Davis et al., 2014).",Providing the Spark: Impact of financial incentives on battery electric vehicle adoption,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069618303115,31 August 2019,2019,Research Article,284.0

To this end we construct a panel data set of precisely geo-located plants and a plant-level measure of typhoon damage derived from storm track data and a wind field model. Our ,"For those countries that are susceptible to tropical cyclone strikes, the prediction that their intensity may increase with climate change underlines the importance of understanding and being able to quantify the economic consequences of these storms (Knutson et al., 2010; Emanuel, 2013). Much of the existing literature on the impact of tropical cyclones has tended to focus on national or regional effects and the results have been rather mixed.==== However, while insightful, these macroeconomic studies are fairly limited in terms of providing useful information for formulating policies to build resilience. More specifically, tropical storms, as with most natural disasters, are inherently very local in nature and the local impact will likely be, at least to some extent, ‘aggregated out’ if a too broader regional unit of analysis is used.==== Hence, it is argued that any real understanding, and therefore what to target in terms of disaster management policy, can only be derived from more micro-level studies at the level of the individual, household, or firm. However, to date, the existing evidence in this regard is relatively scarce and also provides inconsistent results due in part to different methodological approaches (see e.g., Leiter et al., 2009; Coelli and Manasse, 2014; Ando and Kimura, 2012; Tanaka, 2015; Basker and Miranda, 2017; Cole et al., 2019).====The challenge for researchers wishing to conduct a micro-level analysis of tropical storms is threefold. First, the economic unit of analysis needs to be observed before and after a storm event, and any possible relocation tracked in order to be able to derive plausible inference. Second, it is important to model the impact of the storm locally, which means considering the complex spatially heterogeneous nature of storms to enable one to capture the fact that relatively small differences in distance can result in considerable differences in damage. To this end there has been considerable progress in the economics literature as research has evolved from using simple event indicators or likely endogenous ex-post measured damages to employing physical models to approximate the local impact (see e.g., Strobl, 2012). The remaining, and perhaps greatest challenge, is being able to precisely localize the economic agents of interest so that they match the spatial heterogeneity of the storm impact. The difficulty with localizing economic agents, however, is that the majority of available firm, household or farm data used in existing micro-level studies, do not provide exact locations and instead rely on fairly broad administrative regions.====This paper attempts to overcome the aforementioned challenges by explicitly spatially modelling potential damages from typhoons (the name given to tropical cyclones in the Northwestern Pacific region) using features of the storm and linking these to a panel of Chinese manufacturing plants while also controlling for potentially climatic confounding factors (local rainfall and temperature). China arguably represents an ideal country to study as it is subject to around 5.8 damaging storms per year and, importantly, these storms have caused considerable damage to its coast where much of the recently expanded manufacturing activity is located. Q. Zhang et al. (2009) show that total economic losses and hence vulnerability to tropical cyclones in China have been increasing over time and Fischer et al. (2015) estimate economic losses from tropical cyclones in China for our period 2000–2006 to be in the region on US$ 9.05 billion (2017 prices) annually.====Our contribution to the current literature is three-fold. First, we follow previous studies that model damages due to tropical cyclones locally via a physical wind field model, but are able to do so much more precisely by identifying the exact location of each plant by using detailed address information.==== Second, using our geo-localized panel of Chinese manufacturing plants and the associated typhoon damages we are the first that are able to not only quantify the impact of these storms on various aspects of plant performance, but also identify the channels by which plants react to the exogenous shock, including changes to liquidity and debt ratios, depletion of inventories, and imports of intermediate inputs and exports.==== Finally, we contribute to the literature on local supply chains by generating a number of spatial spillover indices to capture the typhoon damage on suppliers, customers and competitors and to estimate whether possible spatial linkages indirectly impact the performance of our plants.====There are a number of studies that are related to what we do in this paper. One of the closest is Leiter et al. (2009) who examine the impact on firms of being located within a flood hit region. However, although they are able to control for individual firm level characteristics they are not able to identify whether any particular firm was inundated (they assume their broad flood measure captures the cumulative impact of the flood on inputs and productivity). Their results show that firms in flooded areas experience stronger growth in employment and capital accumulation in the short-run compared with unaffected firms although they also find a short-term negative impact on productivity. In another paper on the impact of flooding on firm performance, Coelli and Manasse (2014) find that the value added of Italian firms hit by a flood was 6.9% higher than unaffected firms two years later driven in part by government aid that contributed around 2% to this additional growth. This finding is consistent with a build back better effect and the notion that if more capital is destroyed than labor in a local area, the return to capital may increase leading to a short-term growth impact.====Cole et al. (2019) is also close in spirit to our paper in using a plant specific measure of damage, although this is constructed using ex-post measured damages from a ground survey and thus possibly subject to omitted variable bias. In their study of the 1995 Kobe earthquake the main finding is that building level damage significantly and negatively impacts the probability that a manufacturing plant will survive, with this effect lasting up to seven years after the earthquake. They also find a small temporary increase in productivity following the earthquake consistent with a build back better effect.==== Business survival is also looked at by Basker and Miranda (2017) in the aftermath of the Hurricane Katrina, again using an ex-post assessment of damage at the plant location level, and discover that establishments in large chains were more likely to recover from major structural damage and that establishments located close to banks had better recovery rates. Likewise, for Hurricane Katrina, Craioveanu and Terrell (2016) consider the impact of storms on firm survival using a spatial Bayesian analysis to show that firms with less damage and larger firms in general are more likely to survive.====A further, but little researched, mechanism by which natural disasters can impact firms, that we also investigate in our paper, is through international trade. Of the few studies that examine the trade channel, Gassebner et al. (2010) show, in a study of global disasters between 1962 and 2004, that an additional disaster reduces imports and exports by 0.2% and 0.1% respectively. In contrast, Parsons (2016) shows that Hurricane Katrina had no noticeable effect on US imports. Finally, in a detailed study of the impact on Japanese trade following the Great East Japan earthquake of 2011, Ando and Kimura (2012) find a fairly dramatic short-term decline in exports while at the same time imports increased substantially.====Finally, there is a small literature that considers the impact of natural disasters on supply chains that we address in this paper through our calculation of a number of spatial spillover indices. Theoretically, Henriet et al. (2012) show how a firm's “connectedness” and its ability to find new customers and clients as well as the role of imports to replace domestic suppliers can either dampen or magnify the effect of a natural disaster. One of the first studies in this literature was by Altay and Ramirez (2010) who demonstrate that disasters impact all sectors within the supply chain and that the impact on turnover is dependent on a firm's position within that chain. More recently, Hamaguchi (2013) in a study of manufacturing establishments in the prefectures affected by the Great East Japan earthquake finds that establishments did change parts suppliers (without a loss in product quality but with an increase in cost and distance). Similarly, Inoue and Todo (2017) in a study of Japanese firm supply chains discover that firms tend to substitute damaged for undamaged suppliers and that the size of any direct impact of damage differs greatly depending on the structure of the supply network in an economy. Finally, Hayakawa et al. (2015) show that the 2011 floods in Thailand affected Japanese owned affiliates in Thailand. Although the overall effect was small, firms reduced their local procurement from other Japanese affiliates in Thailand and imports increased from China and Japan (for old and young firms respectively).====To briefly summarize our results, we show that the impact of typhoon damage on firm performance is considerable, resulting in a fall in turnover and profits, although the effect is relatively short-lived, lasting no longer than a year after the shock. Annual total costs to Chinese plants from typhoons are estimated to be in the region of US$ 3.2 billion (2017 prices), or about 1 per cent of average turnover. While the impact can be sizable if a storm is large, our results suggest that the economic impact can be mitigated by plants drawing down on their inventories and through the use of debt instruments and a reduction in existing cash balances. We also find that on average, plants reduce sales to the domestic market to a greater extent than they do to foreign markets and increase their imports of intermediates a year after the storm following a small fall in the year of the storm. Exports in contrast grow considerably in the year after the storm perhaps as a result of damage to local buyers. In terms of labor market outcomes, we also find a small increase in employment in the year after the storm and a reduction in the total value of wages paid in the year of the storm. Finally, we find indirect effects through damages to customers, and competitors, where the largest negative impact is via damage to local domestic customers.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe our data, the construction of our plant level panel and our baseline estimating equation. In Section 3 we present our econometric results.

Using the establishment of environmental courts in China as a quasi-natural experiment, our difference-in-differences estimation shows that: (1) environmental courts significantly enhance environmental investment by firms, and this relationship is robust to different specifications and alternative measures; (2) three possible channels are the improved levels of justice and enforcement of environmental protection, and the mitigation of local government intervention; (3) our findings are particularly pronounced in subsamples with severe local protectionism, state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and non-SOEs with political connections; (4) at the city-level, environmental courts significantly increase air quality and promote cities to cross the inflection point of the ==== earlier. Overall, this paper reveals the micro-mechanisms behind the real effects of environmental justice on firm environmental investment, thus providing timely implications for regulators concerned with environmental protection.","The activities of industrial firms are the primary source of pollution.==== Therefore, it is essential that governments enforce effective policies to promote firms to invest in the environment. However, firms investing in environmental issues often suffer increased operational costs and reduced profits. While firms can potentially profit from eco-innovations (Berman and Bui, 2001; Jaffe et al., 1995), most do so without much fanfare, which highlights the importance of promoting and motivating firms to invest in the environment.====One potential solution is environmental public interest litigation, such as the introduction of environmental courts in China, Vermont in the U.S.A., Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, etc.==== However, although environmental courts play a significant role in judicial practice and are hotly debated in the legal studies literature,==== surprisingly little we know about the causal effects of environmental courts on environmental investment by firms. Furthermore, given the potential conflict of interests among different government departments and local firms, it is still unclear whether environmental courts actually enhance environmental investment by firms.====In the literature, the real effects of legal systems continue to be widely debated (Levine, 2005; Zingales, 2015), and evaluating the effects of legal institutions on the real economy is challenging due to cross-sectional differences in economic development (Sala-I-Martin et al., 2004; Dippel, 2014). In our paper, a major challenge is identifying the causal effects of legal institutions on environmental expenditure, due to both reverse causality and omitted variable concerns. While environmental courts may shape firm behavior by influencing the potential cost of business operations, the establishment of environmental courts could also stem from the environmental protection behavior of local firms. Omitted variables can also bias estimations with traditional regressions. Unobservable regional or firm characteristics related to both legal institutions and firm investment are left in the residual term of the regression, making it difficult to draw the correct statistical inferences.====In an attempt to fill this gap, we evaluate the economic consequences of environmental legal institutions by taking advantage of a natural experiment in court enforcement within a country setting, i.e., the environmental courts in China, to generate plausible exogenous variation. The establishment of ECs in China is required by the Supreme People's Court (SPC), and is thus less likely to be driven by local government incentives.====China is an ideal laboratory for investigating the effect of environmental courts on firm environmental expenditure given that environmental protection is economically significant in China (Cai et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2018). As the Environmental Performance Index (2016) indicates, air pollution in China is now responsible for 20% of deaths, killing 4000 people per day. The air people breathe is ranked as China's third greatest risk factor, and more than 50% of its population is exposed to unsafe levels of fine particulate matter according to World Health Organization standards. Our findings can therefore provide timely policy implications to emerging economies facing similar questions.====However, in China, although the State Council's “====” specifically mentions the “promotion of environmental public interest litigation,” such litigation has been slow to move beyond desire and debate (Wang and Gao, 2010). Fortunately, this situation changed fundamentally in November 2007. To signal a commitment to environmental protection and defuse explosive disputes, Qingzhen (a county in Guizhou Province) established the first environmental court in China, and rendered its judgment publicly on the Tianfeng Chemical Factory case in December 2007. Other environmental courts were quickly established, and there are now over 130 environmental courts nationwide,==== providing an ideal setting to test the real effects of institutional design on firm investment. Environmental courts exercise exclusive jurisdiction over environmental cases in their designated areas.====Our identification strategy is based on the quasi-natural experiment of establishing environmental courts, and uses the difference-in-differences (DID) approach to examine the real effects of legal environmental institutions on firm environmental expenditure. We manually collect the EC establishment information from news reports on the official website of the local people's courts in China, and environmental investment from firms' annual financial reports.====Using this data, we provide evidence that environmental courts significantly increase corporate environmental investment and show that this finding is robust after controlling for endogenous issues and alternative explanations.====Furthermore, we investigate the underlying mechanisms of environmental courts that affect firms' environmental efforts, and we find that the establishment of environmental courts promotes the environmental protection expenditure of firms in both direct and indirect ways. First, environmental courts directly enhance the possibility of the public taking legal action against firms for their polluting activities, which will result in an increased number of civil lawsuits (i.e., the first direct way). Second, environmental courts could directly improve environmental administration and environmental law execution, resulting in higher costs of firms' polluting activities, which will lead to an increasing number of non-lawsuit executions (i.e., the second direct way). Third, environmental courts could prosecute local governments for their inaction or wrong action in local environmental governance, which will result in an increasing number of administrative lawsuits. Local governments under such pressure to protect the environment will transfer this pressure to polluting firms by strengthening their monitoring of the pollution of local firms. Faced with increasing polluting costs, local firms will increase their environmental investment to reduce the adverse impact of their polluting activities. The third channel is an indirect way of promoting firms’ environmental protection expenditures.====Then, we evaluate the impact of local government asylum on environmental pollution. We find that the effect of environmental courts on corporate environmental investment is more pronounced in subsamples with severe local protectionism, state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and non-SOEs with political connections. In addition, our city-level results exhibit consistency, and it appears that environmental courts can promote cities to cross the inflection point of the environmental Kuznets curve (====) earlier.====This study makes several contributions to the literature. First, we add to the literature in the intersection of law and economics by providing causal evidence that ECs can significantly shape firm investment activities. Our analysis is among the first to trace the micro-level mechanisms through which legal institutions influence real economic activity.==== Using a plausible exogenous within-country variation in legal institutions, we offer novel evidence that firm behavior resulting from legal institutions leads to real outcomes.====Second, we contribute to the literature on the determinants of firm's environmental efforts. A better understanding of how legal institutions determine firm environmental expenditure is particularly important given the remarkable role of environmental issues in China and worldwide. We show that the establishment of environmental courts significantly affects the allocation of firm investment toward environmental protection. Our results highlight one important channel of the determinants of firm environmental expenditure, thus complementing previous studies, which mainly focus on the effect of environmental regulation on firm financial performance (Konar and Cohen, 2001), productivity (Albrizio et al., 2017), labor demand (Liu et al., 2017), exports (Hering and Poncet, 2014; Shi and Xu, 2018), and environmental expenditure in developed markets (Nakamura et al., 2001; Cole, Elliott, Okubo, and Zhou, 2013).====In addition, this paper provides timely implications for policymakers in emerging markets concerned about the effects of firm activities on the environment, and calls for local governments to enhance the environmental protection efforts of local firms.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

However, evidence of the distributional impacts for different workers remains scant. We examine the associations between climate policies, proxied by energy prices, and workforce skills for 14 European countries and 15 industrial sectors over the period 1995–2011. Using a shift-share ==== estimator and controlling for the influence of automation and globalization, we find that climate policies have been skill biased against manual workers and have favoured technicians. The long-term change in energy prices accounted for between 9.2% and 17.5% (resp. 4.2% and 8.0%) of the increase (resp. decrease) in the share of technicians (resp. manual workers).","Concerns about international competitiveness and job losses have often characterized the political debate over climate policies. The withdrawal of the US from the Paris Agreement is only the latest episode of a political discourse that, especially among the conservative parties, has exploited the job-killing argument to block the approval of ambitious climate policies (Coglianese et al., 2014). Cragg et al. (2013) showed that US Congressional representatives are less inclined to vote for climate policies if they were elected from areas that are both poorer and have a pollution-intensive industrial structure. While the job-killing argument is less popular in the European debate, generous exemptions have been adopted in all countries to shelter polluting industries from international competition (Ekins and Speck, 1999). According to Martin et al. (2014), policymakers have overstated the relocation risk produced by the European Emission Trading Scheme (EU-ETS), which is the flagship EU policy on climate change mitigation. Empirical evidence has not disconfirmed these concerns: in most cases, air quality regulations and energy prices (a proxy for carbon taxes) have modest negative employment effects that are concentrated among polluting and energy-intensive industries (e.g. Greenstone, 2002; Kahn and Mansur, 2013; Walker, 2011). Although such negative effects can be offset by well-designed tax recycling schemes (Yamazaki, 2017), direct subsidies to the green economy (Vona et al., forthcoming) and induced innovations (Horbach and Rennings, 2013; Gagliardi et al., 2016), climate policies can still have large distributional consequences for different groups of workers, undermining the policies' political acceptability.====Of particular importance is assessing whether the labour market impacts of climate policies reinforce the well-known secular trend of skill upgrading induced by globalization and automation (Acemoglu and Autor, 2011; Goos et al., 2014; Lu and Ng, 2013; Autor et al., 2013). Regarding information and communication technology (ICT henceforth), firms exposed to stringent climate policies could adopt technologies and organizational practices that require different worker competencies. Ultimately, whether climate policies and the greening of our economies induce changes in skill demand and the extent to which these changes are aligned with those of on-going technological transformations are empirical issues that our paper seeks to answer.====The first step of our research is to provide an exploratory examination of how the adoption of climate policies interacts with other labour market trends in shaping long-term changes in workforce composition. Indeed, reemployment opportunities for displaced workers depend on their skill sets and are likely less promising for workers whose competencies are offshored or automated. Conversely, workers equipped with the competencies needed in new green jobs will benefit from the expansion in the demand for green goods and services induced by such policies (Vona et al., forthcoming).====We contribute in three ways to the scant empirical literature on the distributional impacts of environmental policies across different worker groups, which has mostly been limited to the US (Walker, 2011; Vona et al., 2018). First, we expand the breadth and generality of previous works by considering a more aggregated level of analysis. Specifically, we examine the associations between climate policies and workforce skills for 14 European countries and 15 industrial sectors over the period 1995–2011. Similar to previous research on the impact of ICT (Michaels et al., 2014), this approach allows us to examine within-sector cross-country differences in the associations between climate policies and labour demand by skill group.====Second, we build a unique dataset containing information on exposure to climate policies, green innovations and other structural changes, essentially trade and (ICT and non-ICT) capital investments (section 2). On the one hand, this dataset allows us to isolate the effects of climate policies on workforce skills in our econometric analyses. On the other hand, we gain descriptive insights into how climate policies interact with other structural transformations in the labour market. We use cluster analysis to assign each sector-country pair to a group representing the combined exposure to different structural transformations, including those related to climate change (section 3). In this way, we are able to capture the overlap of such structural transformations and thus the potentially cumulative effects of present and future climate policies.====Third, we estimate the effects of climate policies, proxied by energy prices as in Sato et al. (2019), on workforce skills. In doing so, we isolate the effects of energy prices by controlling for time invariant sector-by-country characteristics as well as for sector-, country- and cluster-specific time trends. We address the residual concerns regarding the endogeneity of energy prices (i.e., time-varying omitted variables, such as quantity discounts) using a standard shift-share instrument. We find that properly accounting for endogeneity changes only the magnitude of the estimated effects and that, if anything, ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates are downward biased.====There are three main notable results from our analysis. First, the cluster analysis shows that clusters exposed to climate policies (with higher GHG emissions intensity) and to other structural transformations (i.e., trade exposed) are not necessarily at a disadvantage relative to other clusters. Second, the large increase in energy prices that occurred between 1995 and 2011 did not exacerbate the employment decline of polluting sectors. Third, the main finding of our paper is that a weak and insignificant effect of energy prices on total employment masks significant heterogeneity across occupational groups, with a pronounced skill bias in favour of technicians and against manual workers. The historical increase in energy prices explains only a modest fraction (i.e., between 4.2% and 8.0%) of the large decline in the share of manual workers' employment between 2011 and 1995. By contrast, the effect of energy prices on technicians ranges between 9.2% and 17.5%. Compared to other structural transformations, a peculiar aspect of climate policies is that the bias in favour of abstract occupations is concentrated among technical occupations (ISCO 3), such as Physical and Engineering Science Technicians, Process Control Technicians and Government Regulatory Associate Professionals.",Climate policies and skill-biased employment dynamics: Evidence from EU countries,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069618304911,12 August 2019,2019,Research Article,287.0

When endeavors based on private and common pool resources are interconnected, investment in one can put the other at risk. We model Senegalese pastoralists who choose whether to grow crops, a private activity, or raise livestock on common pool pastureland. Livestock can increase the likelihood of locust outbreaks via ecological processes related to grassland degradation. Locust outbreaks damage crops, but not livestock, which are used for savings and insurance. We show the incentive to self-protect (reduce grazing pressure) or self-insure (increase livestock levels) changes with various property rights schemes and levels of ecological detail. If the common pool nature of insurance exacerbates the ecological externality even fully-informed individuals may make risk management decisions that increase the probability of catastrophe, creating an “insurance trap.”","Insurance is often portrayed as an important ecosystem service (Baumgärtner, 2007; Baumgärtner and Strunz, 2014; Loreau et al., 2003; Naeem and Li, 1997; Quaas and Baumgärtner, 2008). The ecological insurance argument is based on the idea that ecological processes stabilize ecosystems, providing an insurance effect (Loreau et al., 2003). However, these ecological processes may be more of a self-protection effect, reducing the probability of bad events, rather than an insurance effect that redistributes income from a good state to a bad state of the world (Ehrlich and Becker, 1972; Shogren and Crocker, 1999). Furthermore, not all feedbacks in ecosystems are stabilizing or welfare enhancing. Aside from providing insurance, biophysical-economic interconnections can also generate ecological externalities, for example predator control can lead to pest explosions or in some cases greater risk to endangered species (Crocker and Tschirhart, 1992; Melstrom and Horan, 2013). When people have sufficient control over the system, then management can be targeted to ensure that feedbacks produce stabilizing and welfare enhancing services (Fenichel and Horan, 2016; Horan et al., 2018b). But institutions determine who makes decisions and whether there is sufficient coordinated control (Berkes et al., 2008; Ostrom, 1990). Without secure property rights or other mechanisms that lead to cooperation, individuals can have little incentive to manage ecological interactions that impact the future state of the system (Horan et al., 2011), including future risks. Nevertheless, when individuals face the potential for bad events, people do what they can to avoid potential losses. This includes engaging in self-insurance that could involve ecological production. If the act of investing in self-insurance uses ecological production, then it is possible that the act of self-insuring increases the risk of bad events. If this happens individuals may become trapped in a state of high risk despite their attempts to insure.====Income traps are a common concern in the economic development literature, and household decision makers that lack access to financial markets can become “trapped” because they invest in safer assets and miss out on the higher return activity (Barrett and Carter, 2013; Zimmerman and Carter, 2003) or are simply unable to finance higher yielding, non-marginal fixed capital investments (Fenichel et al., 2019). Ecological and financial insurance can act as substitutes, so that lacking access to financial insurance, individuals may use ecological production to generate a self-insurance asset instead (Quaas and Baumgärtner, 2008). Such behavior follows the broader literature that market insurance and self-insurance are substitutes (Ehrlich and Becker, 1972).====Poverty traps are often attributed to a lack of financial insurance or markets, but incomplete property rights can also lead to poverty traps. A common motivation for a poverty trap involves risk preferences and endowments that interact to cause multi-stability, and impoverished individuals remain at low welfare equilibria because of lack of access to credit and financial insurance (Barrett and Carter, 2013; Carter and Lybbert, 2012; Zimmerman and Carter, 2003). We show that when considering ecological externalities, insecure property rights can lead to similar dynamics. In the case study, Senegalese agro-pastoralists choose between a risky investment of scarce labor resources in a cash crop subject to locust outbreaks and livestock production, which is invariant to locust outbreaks. Therefore, livestock are an insurance asset. However, livestock production takes place on common pasture. We expect the agro-pastoralist to use livestock to insure against locust outbreaks to protect income, reducing investment in the cash crop. Locust outbreaks are connected to grassland degradation (Cease et al., 2015, 2012), which can be caused by overgrazing, creating an “insurance trap.”====The insurance trap results from an interaction between the endogenous nature of risk and imperfect property rights. If the capital used to harvest in the commons also provides self-insurance with respect to other income streams, then this insurance benefit can lead to even greater exploitation of commons. Yet commons are often complex ecosystems, so greater exploitation may increase other costs or generate other risks. These other risks are generated via a common pool and are not internalized. In this context of institutional failure and missing property rights, individuals may be particularly dependent on the common pool pasture to insure against catastrophic risk. Therefore, exploitation and the costs or damages of the commons may exceed costs calculations from standard models that ignore interactions with other markets.====The self-protection and insurance literature largely focus on two market effects: how reducing the losses associated with a disaster leads to less self-protection, and how reducing the price of insurance when individuals engage in self-protection reduces incentives for self-protection (Ehrlich and Becker, 1972). Ehrlich and Becker (1972) demonstrate that a larger “loading factor” or the markup above a “fair price” for insurance discourages insurance. We demonstrate that ecological interactions create an “ecological loading factor.” The ecological loading factor that decision makers respond to is dependent on the set of resource shadow prices that those decision makers respond to. Indeed, relationships like predator-prey feedbacks can increase ecological loading factors. Furthermore, the process of self-insuring can go beyond failing to mitigate an adverse event and can increase the probability of the event. This makes insuring using ecological production costly and shifts cooperative managers to focus on “self-protection.”====We contribute to the literature by placing the “ecological insurance concept” in the context of the theory of the second-best (Lipsey and Lancaster, 1956). The most common use of “ecological insurance” may be cases where financial insurance markets are missing. However, when ecological insurance involves open access to commons and processes in the commons generate the risk (e.g., through ecological externalities), then self-protection is in fact “group protection.” Therefore, the coordination problem involves unpriced risk and underpriced resources. Specifically, common property regimes reduce realized shadow prices and reduce the realized “ecological loading factor.” This leads to excess investment in using ecological production to generate a private self-insurance asset, but this increases the probability of bad events in addition to leading to undersupply of common pool resources. An important insight is that ecosystems provide opportunities for self-insurance and for group or self-protection. Assumptions of cooperative solutions focus on protection rather than insurance, which leads us to question the “ecological insurance metaphor.”====Similar insurance traps can be found in the portfolios of permits held by commercial fishermen, the use of fertilizers and intensive farming practices that deplete soil nutrient content, suppression of small wildfires and increasing fuel bases, and the trade in illicit ivory where scarcity increases the financial incentive of poachers (Di Gregorio et al., 2008). Indeed, common pool resources remain common throughout the world and are often most important to the poorest in society and resource degradation is tied to poverty traps (Dasgupta and Mäler, 1995; Stavins, 2011).",The ecological insurance trap,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069618300275,9 August 2019,2019,Research Article,288.0

It also offers a candidate mechanism in support of recent research that links daily air quality to diminished workplace productivity, cognitive performance, school absence, traffic accidents, and other detrimental outcomes.","Our objective in this paper is to investigate a possible causal effect of urban air pollution on the sleep of city inhabitants. Air quality - particularly in cities - is one of the great policy challenges of our time. Understanding the full range of negative impacts of pollution is an essential prerequisite for welfare evaluation of policy interventions.====Sleep is an essential input to human well-being. Loss of sleep reduces mental function along various dimensions, such as learning (Huber et al., 2004), memory (Diekelmann and Born, 2010), judgement (Killgore et al., 2006), speed of reflex (Maquet, 2001) and emotional balance (Ireland and Culpin, 2006). It is correlated with lower self-reported well-being (Hamilton et al., 2007; Steptoe et al., 2008). Tiredness - the inevitable consequence of sleeplessness - has been causally linked to various negative outcomes, including road traffic accidents (Valent et al., 2010), reduced workplace productivity (Zammit et al., 2010; Rosekind et al., 2010), industrial injuries (Barnes and Wagner, 2009), absenteeism (Daley et al., 2009), deteriorated relationship quality (Gordon and Chen, 2014), domestic violence (Meijer et al., 2010), and compromised school performance (Chung and Cheung, 2008). In terms of health outcomes, shortage of sleep over various time scales has been linked to reduced functioning of immune systems and subsequent increased susceptibility to disease, increased risk of hypertension, cardiac and breathing problems, increased adiposity, and negative mental health outcomes.====It is not a surprise that both individuals and governments invest in protecting sleep, and that individuals when asked express a substantial willingness-to-pay to avoid sleep loss (Pollinger, 2014; Delfino et al., 2008).==== In summary, given that the typical adult in most societies spends between 7 and 8 h of each day engaged in the activity of sleep (and children longer): “If sleep does ==== serve an absolutely vital function, then it is the biggest mistake the evolutionary process has ever made.” (Rechtschaffen, 1971).====Despite the centrality of sleep to humans, and the diverse contributions that it makes to individual and societal well-being, economic analysis of it has been cursory. Biddle and Hamermesh (1990) treat sleep choice as a time allocation problem. Similarly, Asgeirsdottir and Zoega (2011) provide a model of sleep behavior as an investment that an individual makes in the level of alertness he then enjoys during the day, in the spirit of the approach taken to health as human capital.====While the channels that might link pollution exposure to lower quantity or quality of sleep are obvious (shortness of breath, elevated heart-rate, irritation of upper airways, eyes etc.), research linking pollution exposure to sleep outcomes is limited. (1) Strøm-Tejsen et al. (2016) manipulate indoor air quality in the campus bedrooms of 16 students and find that indoor air quality impacts both sleep quality (as measured by subject-worn actigraphs) and next-day performance on math and language tests. (2) Using measures of outdoor air quality in a small number of US cities, Zanobetti et al. (2010) show that the same-night ==== in the city in which the subject resides correlates with likelihood of episodes of sleep apnea (pauses in breathing during sleep) and other physiological correlates of sleep health. This is an important paper to which ours is complementary. The advantage of their methods is that they deliver very precise individual-level metrics of sleep. The downsides relate to its focus on sleep-illness, and the observation of subjects via a polysomnograph (sensors at nose, fingers, face and scalp) - not more natural sleeping circumstances - and at much lower levels of ambient pollution than we see in the Chinese cities that we study. (3) Focussing on long-term exposure, and without using tools that would allow for causal inference, Billings et al. (2017) find a negative association between sleep efficiency amongst a sample of older people and 5-year and 1-year measures of ==== in the neighborhoods of the six US cities in which they live.====Sleep loss is a significant problem in China (Luo et al., 2013) and elsewhere. For the 19 largest Chinese cities, we construct a nightly, population-level measure of sleeplessness using frequency of use of the Chinese characters meaning ‘can't sleep’, ‘sleepless’ etc. on the very widely-used social media site Weibo.==== We estimate an equation using OLS to characterize a positive association between that measure and same-day local air quality. To reinforce our causal interpretation of this relationship, we apply IV methods, using plausible exogenous variations in short-term wind patterns to instrument for air quality. In our preferred specifications, we find that a one standard deviation in ==== causes an 11.6% increase in sleeplessness relative to mean, and for ==== the number is 12.8%. The statistical significance and estimated effect size prove to be remarkably robust to a battery of alternative specifications and tests.====We are cautious not to over-interpret the results. Monetizing the sleep loss caused by diminished air quality is beyond the scope of this paper, though it is worth noting that previous research does provide WTP estimates that could be exploited in a back-of-the envelope exercise. The results are instructive in two ways. First, the loss of sleep plausibly impacts the well-being of the affected individual him or herself through a variety of channels. Second, as noted, the results provide a mechanism consistent with recent research linking short-term variations in air quality to reduced workplace productivity (Graff Zivin and Neidell, 2012; Chang et al., 2016), school absence (Currie et al., 2009), exam performance Mendell and Heath (2005), motor vehicle accidents (Sager, 2016) etc.====Section 2 details data sources.

In addition, emissions markets have to be enforced well if they are to achieve their goals. One of the most important lessons of the literature on enforcing emissions markets is that the competitive market price of emissions permits determines a firm's marginal benefit of violating their permits, and therefore is critical in determining compliance behavior and enforcement strategies (Malik, 1990; Murphy and Stranlund, 2006, 2007; Stranlund, 2017). Thus, the risk associated with regulatory uncertainty about abatement costs can be transmitted to enforcement effort and compliance choices via changes in the price of emissions permits. Consequently, we have conducted a series of laboratory experiments to examine this transmission of abatement cost risk.====Our work is motivated by, and contributes to, two literatures. The first is the literature on policy choice under uncertainty. Weitzman's (1974) seminal work on prices versus quantities under uncertainty remains relevant to this day. Weitzman's results suggest that an emissions tax is the preferred instrument if the marginal damage function is not as steeply sloped as the marginal abatement cost function, while an emissions market with a fixed number of tradable permits is preferred if the relative steepness of the marginal damage and marginal abatement cost functions is reversed. An emissions tax allows the transmission of the abatement cost risk to emissions but not to the emissions price, while an emissions market fixes aggregate emissions so that abatement cost risk is only transmitted to the emissions price. Roberts and Spence (1976) constructed an emissions market with price controls that is often more efficient than a simple tax or a simple market because it spreads the transmission of abatement cost risk to both emissions and the emissions price in an efficient manner. More recent work on markets with price controls for greenhouse gases has continued to push this line of inquiry forward (e.g., Burtraw et al., 2010; Fell and Morgenstern, 2010; Weber and Neuhoff, 2010; Grull and Taschini, 2011). Moreover, many proposed and existing emissions markets have some form of price control (Hood, 2010; Newell et al., 2013).====The other literature that our work contributes to is the literature on enforcing emissions permit markets. See Stranlund (2017) for a thorough review of this literature. The fundamental problem of enforcing emissions markets is to make sure that pollution sources hold enough permits to cover their current emissions. This requires that regulators have systems in place to track emissions permits, but the much more difficult problem is to monitor sources' emissions. Moreover, both monitoring effort and applying sanctions are costly activities. Economists have examined the consequences of noncompliance in permit markets (Malik, 1990; Stranlund and Dhanda, 1999; Murphy and Stranlund, 2006, 2007); compliance outcomes in the presence of market power (van Egteren and Weber, 1996; Malik, 2002; Chavez and Stranlund, 2003); the effects of permit banking on compliance choices (Innes, 2003; Stranlund et al., 2005; Cason and Gangadharan, 2006; Stranlund et al., 2011); the efficient design of emissions markets, including their enforcement components (Stranlund, 2007; Caffera and Chávez, 2011), and other enforcement-related concerns.====While the literatures about policy choices under abatement cost uncertainty and enforcing emissions markets are both extensive, only a few authors have tied regulator uncertainty about abatement costs, the instrument choice problem, and enforcement of emissions markets together in theoretical models. The first to do so was Montero (2002), who reexamined the instrument choice problem under imperfect and costly enforcement. He found that an expected marginal penalty for permit violations that is lower than what would be necessary to induce full compliance under all realizations of aggregate abatement costs serves as a price ceiling as envisioned by Roberts and Spence (1976). If firms' abatement costs turn out to be high enough, then the permit price will rise to the expected marginal penalty and firms will increase their emissions beyond the permitted cap by violating their permits. Allowing the transmission of abatement cost risk to compliance choices can improve the performance of an emissions market.====However, Stranlund and Moffitt (2014) note several problems with using imperfect enforcement to provide a price ceiling in emissions markets. First, sanctioning noncompliant firms is not costless, so using imperfect enforcement to mitigate abatement cost risk involves the possibility of incurring costs to impose sanctions on noncompliant firms. Second, imperfect enforcement allows the transmission of abatement cost risk to compliance choices and to sanctioning actions and their costs. Finally, imperfect enforcement cannot be used to motivate extra emissions control when abatement costs turn out to be lower than expected. Stranlund and Moffitt (2014) propose a design that features enforcement to eliminate violations under all circumstances, an explicit price ceiling and a floor, and a sanction that varies directly with the permit price. This design addresses both low side and high-side abatement cost risk; full compliance eliminates variable sanctioning costs and emissions volatility, and making sanctions vary with the permit price prevents the transmission of abatement cost risk to monitoring efforts and their costs. Tying sanctions to permit prices is uncommon in actual emissions markets, but they were proposed for the US Clear Skies Initiative (US EPA, 2003) and the US American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 (US Congress, 2009), and were implemented in pilot programs of China's CO==== emissions trading system (Zhang, 2015).====Following the theoretical work of Montero (2002) and Stranlund and Moffitt (2014), in this paper we examine the transmission of abatement cost risk to compliance choices and enforcement actions with a series of laboratory experiments. These experiments consisted of markets with eight participants competing for a limited number of emissions permits (called production rights in the experiments), randomly changing abatement costs (called production benefits), and the possibility of imperfect compliance. In each round, subjects had to determine their emissions levels, trade for their desired number of permits, and consequently decide whether to violate their permits and by how much. Our initial design consisted of three treatments. The Baseline treatment involved a fixed monitoring probability of 0.5 and a fixed sanction that produced a constant expected marginal penalty that was not high enough to motivate full compliance by risk-neutral firms, except when abatement costs were at their lowest level. We hypothesized that there would be significant violations in this treatment, and significant volatility in both emissions and violation choices. In practice, this transmission of risk to compliance choices would also cause the transmission of risk to sanctioning actions and their costs. On the other hand, in the Baseline treatment we expected minimal price volatility as the fixed expected marginal sanction would establish a price ceiling when abatement costs were at higher levels.====In the second and third treatments, we attempted to motivate full compliance by tying elements of the enforcement strategy to average permit prices in each round. The Audit treatment had a fixed per-unit penalty, but the monitoring probability varied directly with the average trading price. We parameterized this treatment so that, in theory, the resulting expected marginal penalty in every round would be roughly 10% higher than the average trading price, with the expectation that this would be sufficient to motivate full compliance by all subjects. With perfect compliance, there would be no emissions volatility—all the volatility in abatement costs would be transmitted to the permit price and monitoring effort.====To eliminate the transmission of risk to monitoring effort, the Fine treatment had a fixed 0.5 monitoring probability, but the per-unit penalty was tied directly to the average trading price in a period. We parameterized the Fine treatment so that the resulting expected marginal penalty would again be roughly 10% higher than the average trading price. Again, we expected full compliance, zero emissions volatility, and significant price volatility. Confirmation of these hypotheses would suggest that policymakers could maintain compliance in an emissions market and prevent the transmission of abatement cost volatility to both monitoring and sanctioning costs by tying the marginal sanction directly to observed permit prices. In addition, tying sanctions to prices is likely to be easier to implement than tying monitoring to prices, which we discuss later in the paper. Thus, tying sanctions to prices has both theoretical and practical advantages over tying monitoring to prices.====Our results support some of our hypotheses, but not all. As expected, there were significant violations and emissions volatility under the Baseline treatment. However, violations and emissions volatility were not as high as predicted. Consequently, permit prices were higher and significantly more volatile than expected. That the subjects did not violate their permits as often as predicted is consistent with other work in this area (e.g., Stranlund et al., 2013; Raymond and Cason, 2011).====Tying monitoring to average permit prices effectively eliminated noncompliance as the model predicts. In addition, emissions volatility was not significantly different than zero, but permit price volatility was significantly higher. This result confirms our hypothesis that making enforcement responsive to price volatility by tying monitoring to permit prices can eliminate noncompliance, but allows the transmission of abatement cost risk to monitoring effort.====Tying the sanction to average permit prices in the Fine treatment was less successful in inducing compliance. As hypothesized, violations and emissions volatility were significantly lower than under the Baseline; however, in theory both should be eliminated. Instead, we observed significant violations and emissions volatility in this treatment.====After analyzing the results from our original experiments, we conducted another treatment (High Fine) that involved tying the sanction to permit prices, but increased the markup so that the expected marginal penalty was 50% higher than the average price in a period. Our intention was to examine whether a substantial increase in the permit violation sanctions could eliminate noncompliance. Although violations were reduced in the High Fine treatment, they still were not eliminated. It is clear that subjects reacted differently to price-induced changes in monitoring than sanctions, although it is not clear why. Despite the theoretical and practical advantages of tying sanctions to permit prices, this strategy resulted in significant noncompliance whereas tying monitoring to prices did not.====In addition, we observed a small but non-trivial number of subjects who sold permits at very low prices, presumably attempting to reduce the expected marginal penalty. We demonstrate that this behavior could not have been individually rational, and hence may be unlikely in real emissions markets. However, it does raise the concern that tying permit violation penalties to going permit prices may motivate attempts to manipulate pricing. It may be possible to address these concerns with simple policy fixes. For example, imposing a minimum penalty or basing the penalty on the median trading price instead of the average price should eliminate the influence of permit sales at low prices on the resulting enforcement strategy.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In the next section we present the design of our experiments, including a sketch of the theory that motivates our work. In the third section we present our results. In the fourth section we conclude with a discussion of the relevance of our results for designing emissions markets.",Tying enforcement to prices in emissions markets: An experimental evaluation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069618304613,9 July 2019,2019,Research Article,292.0

Extensive empirical evidence has documented the relationship between air quality and housing values.==== However, another important channel is ignored by the literature: air pollution abatement policies may impose substantial costs to regulated plants and further impact labor markets.==== The harmful effect on labor markets, e.g., a decrease in employment, may weaken housing demand and further dampen the growth in house prices. Therefore, the answer to the question of how environmental policies influence housing markets can be ambiguous; it depends on both the extent of the improvement of the air quality and the impacts of these policies on the local businesses.====While the literature has focused on the “health channel” of environmental regulations, with positive effects on house prices, we take into account both this health channel and a “labor-market” channel. This factual combination of both channels reveals the heterogeneous effects of air quality regulations on house prices. This paper exploits a quasi-experiment, the NO==== Budget Trading Program (NBP), examining the influence of this cap-and-trade system on the housing markets in the participating regions. The NBP was designed to reduce ozone concentrations in the Eastern region of the U.S. by restricting nitrogen oxides (NO====) emissions.==== It was implemented from 2003 to 2008 in nineteen states in addition to Washington, D.C. (see Fig. 1). Deschenes et al. (2012) found that the NBP dramatically reduced NO==== emissions—and thus ozone pollution—in the participating states. Their study also showed that the health benefits, in terms of medication expenditures and mortality rates, were non-negligible as a result of the air quality improvement. However, Curtis (2014) showed that the NBP also imposed substantial costs on manufacturing plants, leading to lower hiring rates and wages, especially for young workers aged between 22 and 34. This age group represents the main force that drives housing demand, as shown in Fig. 2. This quasi-experiment allows us to distinguish between the health channel and the labor-market channel.====We hypothesize that the house prices in NBP regions with high manufacturing intensity were negatively affected by the emission market, as a result of its impacts on the labor markets. However, the housing markets in low-manufacturing-intensity areas benefited from the air pollution abatement. We use data on zip-code-year level house prices from ====, to study the impacts of the emission market on the house prices. The data are available for more than 10,000 zip code areas in the U.S. and represent more than 95% of the total housing stock by value. To take advantage of the heterogeneity in local business patterns for different counties, we derive industry employment data from the County Business Patterns (CBP) and construct a measure of manufacturing intensity for each county, i.e., the ratio between manufacturing employment and total labor force in 1998.====Our analysis is based on a difference-in-differences identification that exploits the variations of the program's time, geographic, and economic characteristics. Our findings are summarized as follows: First, without considering the heterogeneity in local business patterns, the overall effect of the NBP on housing markets in participating states is not statistically significantly different from zero. Fig. 3 illustrates how the NBP affected housing markets in these states. As can be seen, both NBP and non-NBP states shared a similar trend in house prices before 2003. After the market's operation, however, we find that housing markets in NBP states did not gain much as a result of the environmental regulation, in comparison to those in non-NBP states. Second, we find that the effects of the NBP across counties are heterogeneous: house prices in counties with small manufacturing employment proportions are increased, while those in large manufacturing employment proportions are decreased. Specifically, we find that a 1% increase in manufacturing intensity in 1998 statistically significantly reduced the effect of the NBP on house prices by 0.05%. For perspective, house prices in an area in which manufacturing intensity in 1998 was 50% decreased by 5.7%. This estimate implies that the negative impacts of the NBP on labor markets further dampened the growth house prices in high-manufacturing-intensity regions. In contrast, house prices in an area in which manufacturing intensity in 1998 was 5% shifted up by 4.2%. This finding is consistent with the hedonic theory.====To validate the parallel trend assumption of the difference-in-differences estimator, we employ an event-study framework to examine the presence of pre-existing trends. Specifically, we estimate the impacts of the NBP on house prices across years. The coefficients for years before 2003 are not statistically significantly different from zero, suggesting the absence of evidence of clear differences in the trend in house prices between NBP and non-NBP states before the program's operation.====To pin down the labor-market channel, we first use the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data to investigate how the housing demand was affected in regulated regions. The HMDA is considered the most comprehensive source of mortgage data, covering around 80% of all home loans (Avery et al., 2007). We find that the volume of home loan application statistically significantly decreased in high-manufacturing-intensity areas. In particular, the NBP decreased the application volume in areas with 50% and 40% manufacturing intensity in 1998, by 7.0% and 4.6%, respectively. Interestingly, the NBP also increased the rejection rate for loan applications. The rejection rate in areas with 50% and 40% manufacturing intensity in 1998 was increased by 1.4 and 1.0 percentage points, respectively. This is possibly because lending institutions observed the expectation of the manufacturing sector in regulated areas and thus labeled more applicants in this industry as ineligible ones. These two pieces of evidence indicate that the housing demand was affected by the emission market.====Second, we test whether the environmental policy impacted loan performance by exploiting the BlackBox Logic (BBX) data matched to the HMDA data. To avoid the selection problem, we exclude the loans whose first-month activity in the BBX data was after the policy's initiation. We show that the NBP increased the probability of loan default for individuals in high-manufacturing-intensity areas. This result is consistent with our rationale; the NBP resulted in a higher probability of being unemployed, and thus it led to loan default in these areas. Third, we also rule out an alternative hypothesis, i.e., the heterogeneous effects of the NBP on house prices are a result of the heterogeneous effects of the air pollution abatement. Our results present that the NBP effect on NO==== emissions does not vary by areas with different manufacturing intensities. Fourth, we find that there are limited heterogeneous effects on house prices across other industry intensities or across local demographic characteristics. Fifth, another concern is that the effects on house prices are possibly driven by some random housing supply shocks in the NBP states. We use data on building permits from the Residential Building Permits Survey, to test whether housing supply was affected by the NBP. We find that the NBP effect on housing supply in the NBP states is not statistically significantly different from zero.====We conduct a series of robustness tests. First, as the EPA tightened the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) ozone non-attainment standards in 2004, this policy may bias our estimation. To address this concern, we control the non-attainment status of counties in our regressions. Second, we exclude the Rust Belt states, which are located in the regulated areas, to reduce heterogeneity. The results from these robustness tests are qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those in the main analysis. Third, we examine whether our estimated negative (positive) effects of the NBP on housing prices reflect the international trade shocks to manufacturing industries (the occurrence of housing bubbles) during the 2000s. Our results demonstrate that neither the trade shocks nor housing bubbles in 2000s contribute to our estimates. Lastly, we investigate the NBP effects across house types, which showed to be similar, suggesting that our main results are not driven by a particular type of housing.====Our study makes two contributions to the literature. First, this study provides evidence that environmental policy could negatively impact housing markets due to its adverse effects on labor markets, i.e., the labor-market channel. This adverse effect on housing markets has not been estimated in previous studies. As a result of introducing the emission market, house prices in NBP areas with low (or high) manufacturing intensity increased (or decreased). We quantify the relative importance of the changes in air quality and labor market opportunities caused by the NBP. Second, this is the first study, to our knowledge, that presents the impacts of a large-scale cap-and-trade market on housing markets. Cap-and-trade systems have advantages in terms of efficiency, in comparison to command-and-control style regulations, e.g., NAAQS. Although emission markets provide a market-based solution to abate air pollution, they may also trigger adverse effects (Curtis, 2014). Given the ongoing academic and policy debates on energy sector regulations, fully understanding the impacts of emission markets is important.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a qualitative analysis of NBP impacts on housing markets; Section 3 summarizes our data sources and details the descriptive analysis; Section 4 introduces our empirical framework; Section 5 presents our main findings and sensitivity analyses; and Section 6 concludes.",Environmental regulation as a double-edged sword for housing markets: Evidence from the NO,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069618304509,28 June 2019,2019,Research Article,293.0

Using data from a choice experiment eliciting prospect theory parameters, I provide evidence that loss-averse people are less likely to invest in energy efficiency. Then, I consider policy design under prospect theory when there are also externalities from energy use. A higher degree of loss aversion implies a higher subsidy to energy efficiency. Numerical simulations suggest that the impact of prospect theory on policy may be substantial.","Evidence suggests that when making choices involving risk or uncertainty, people deviate from the predictions of expected utility theory. In particular, their preferences may be reference-dependent: outcomes are evaluated based on gains or losses relative to a reference point rather than on absolute consumption levels. Gains and losses may be treated asymmetrically, with losses counting relatively more than equivalent gains. Probabilities enter the value function non-linearly. Prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979) explains these observed behaviors.====The choice over energy efficiency investments, like buying an energy-efficient car or appliance, involves risk. There is a fixed upfront cost and the promise of energy savings, though the amount of those savings is unknown. Greene (2011) argues that loss aversion can explain the “energy paradox” or “energy efficiency gap,” where individuals appear to neglect ostensibly cost-effective efficiency investments (Allcott and Greenstone, 2012; Gillingham and Palmer, 2014). While prospect theory has been shown to predict behavior across various domains,==== it has never explicitly been shown to predict behavior related to energy efficiency. Little is known about whether consumers' choices over energy efficiency are explained by prospect theory, nor about how policy can be designed if this is the case.====The purpose of this paper is to test whether prospect theory explains consumers' investments in energy efficiency and to see what the implications are for optimal policy design. I conduct a survey that uses a choice experiment to elicit individual-level prospect theory preference parameters, including the extent of loss aversion and probability weighting. I test whether those parameters are correlated with energy-efficiency investments, like owning an alternative-fuel vehicle or Energy Star appliance. Then, I provide a model of optimal policy, in which there are externalities associated with energy use (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions) and behavioral market failures associated with prospect theory. The model demonstrates how optimal policy depends on the degree of deviation from expected utility theory.====This paper contributes to two literature. First, there is an empirical literature documenting, often using randomized control trials, that consumers' energy consumption decisions appear to be motivated by social norms. Allcott and Rogers (2012) find that information provision affects energy usage: consumers who learn that their consumption levels are higher than average reduce their use, but this effect decays over time. A similar effect is found in Ayres et al. (2013), who find that both electricity and natural gas consumption are reduced after information provision, and the reduction lasts at least 7–12 months. Costa and Kahn (2013) observe significantly different treatment responses based on the individual's political ideology: the effect is two to four times larger for liberals than it is for conservatives. In the context of water consumption, Ferraro and Price (2013) find that information on social comparisons are more effective than technical information or savings-encouragement messages. These papers do not explicitly reference prospect theory in interpreting their empirical findings, but the finding are consistent with prospect theory if the information provision changes consumers' reference points, and consumers are averse to losses (higher energy bills) relative to those new reference points.==== Furthermore, most such studies do not find evidence of a “boomerang effect” from social norm-based information provision, where those who are at below-average consumption levels increase consumption after the treatment. This asymmetry is consistent with loss aversion as predicted by prospect theory. To date no study has explicitly tested whether or not prospect theory can explain energy efficiency investments. The empirical evidence provided in this paper tests for such a link.====The second literature that this paper contributes to is a theoretical literature that conducts welfare analysis and studies optimal policy in an economy where consumers behave according to prospect theory. Prospect theory is a positive theory describing how individuals make choices under uncertainty. However, it raises normative questions, given that welfare analysis is not well-defined if consumers deviate from neo-classical expected-utility-maximizing behavior. More broadly, other aspects of behavioral economics raise the same set of questions. More specifically, in the domain of energy and environmental policy, Heutel (2015) considers optimal policy for durable goods with externalities when consumers have quasi-hyperbolic preferences, Allcott et al. (2014) considers policy when consumers undervalue future energy costs, and Tsvetanov and Segerson (2013) consider environmental policy when consumers exhibit temptation and self-control issues.====Under prospect theory, the following general welfare question arises: what should a social planner maximize, given that consumers' preferences are characterized by loss aversion and reference-dependence? A follow-up question is: how does this maximization criterion affect optimal policy? Surprisingly, very few papers have attempted to answer these important normative questions. Kanbur et al. (2006) survey the literature on “non-welfarist"" taxation, defined as the government having an objective function different than individuals'. Kanbur et al. (2008) consider optimal income taxation when consumers exhibit prospect theory, and they consider non-welfarist, or “paternalistic”, social welfare functions. They find that an optimal tax schedule can be discontinuous, owing to the kink in the prospect theory value function at the reference point. Jäntti et al. (2014) consider optimal policy with a social welfare function that exhibits loss aversion. They examine how inequality measures may differ depending on whether preferences are reference-dependent. Dhami and Al-Nowaihi (2010) consider different specifications of individual behavior and government behavior in a model with endogenous tax rates and tax evasion; they find that the evidence is most consistent with individuals using prospect theory and the government using expected utility. One implication of this result that is discussed by Dhami and Al-Nowaihi (2010) is that the social welfare function is based on expected utility though individual behavior is based on prospect theory. All of these approaches can be seen as controversial, since the planner departs from using revealed preference to guide policy.==== As Madrian (2014) ends her review on behavioral economics and policy: “This [assessing the social optimality of behaviorally-informed interventions] of course requires taking a stand on what is socially optimal, a task that admittedly is easier said than done.”====The theory section in this paper considers optimal policy specifically in the context of energy consumption decisions when consumers behave according to prospect theory. In these markets, there already exists a market failure from the externalities associated with energy use. Under prospect theory, there is potentially a second market failure – a “behavioral” failure – if prospect theory implies that consumers are acting sub-optimally in a welfare-relevant sense.==== This paper studies optimal policy in an economy with both prospect theory and externalities from energy use.====This paper presents two sets of results: one empirical and one theoretical. Empirically, I find evidence that prospect theory explains people's investments (or lack thereof) in energy efficiency. I find a negative correlation between an individual's level of loss aversion and several energy efficiency investments, including owning or leasing an alternative fuel vehicle and having a high fraction of energy-efficient light bulbs. Though almost all of the relationships are of the predicted sign, the statistical significance is modest; out of ten estimated coefficients in the main specification, three are significantly negative at the 10% level and three more are negative with p-values less than 0.2. The results are not driven by time preferences, and they are robust to an alternate, non-parametric measure of loss aversion. A one-standard-deviation increase in loss aversion is associated with a 1.5-percentage-point decrease in the probability of owning an alternative fuel vehicle.====Theoretically, I show that the standard Pigouvian prescription to price the externality at expected external costs (or benefits) is modified in the presence of prospect theory in two ways: first, based on the ratio of the true probability of achieving a cost savings to its weighted subjective probability; and second, based on the ratio of marginal utility to the derivative of the value function. Both the analytical results and numerical simulations show that a higher degree of loss aversion implies a higher subsidy to energy efficiency. Simulation results suggest that the market failure calculated using prospect theory can be quite large relative to the market failure calculated assuming expected utility theory.====The next section provides a model of energy efficiency demand under prospect theory that generates testable hypotheses; those hypotheses are tested in section III. Section IV provides the theoretical model of optimal policy; and section V concludes.",Prospect theory and energy efficiency,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009506961830874X,27 June 2019,2019,Research Article,294.0

This paper evaluates the causal effects of a UPS on the disposal of municipal solid waste in Trento, Italy. Using a unique panel dataset of monthly waste generation in Italian municipalities, we employ the synthetic control method, which allows us to account for possible time-varying effects of unobservables. Our results show that the policy was effective, with a significant decrease of the priced waste stream, unsorted waste, by 37.5%. This effect seems to be largely driven by behavioral changes towards waste avoidance (−8.6====) and possibly by a smaller increase in recycling (+6.1====). By comparing these results to those obtained by a difference-in-differences approach, we show that failing to account for time-varying effects of unobservables may lead to a mismeasurement of policy effects.","The process involving generation, collection and disposal of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) characterizes a classic example of a negative externality, as there are environmental and treatment costs associated with MSW that add to the individual's private costs. Standard flat fees on MSW collection, however, do not usually suffice for internalizing the cost difference into individuals' waste generation behavior. Therefore, pricing waste per collected unit, a form of Pigouvian fee (Pigou, 1932), has been increasingly used as a policy instrument, known as Unit Pricing Systems (UPSs) or pay-as-you-throw programs. Existing empirical evaluations of such policies generally find them to be effective, when controlling for selection bias due to unobserved determinants of their adoption with time-invariant effects on waste generation.====Nevertheless, despite their growing popularity, there is an empirical gap on UPSs' effectiveness when the effects of unobservables on waste generation vary over time, and on the behavioral mechanisms behind UPSs’ effects. Using a unique data on monthly waste generation for nineteen municipalities in Italy between 2008 and 2016, this paper attempts to fill this gap by evaluating the causal effects of a UPS implemented on the disposal of unsorted MSW in the municipality of Trento in 2013.====The first contribution of this paper is to address the endogeneity associated with UPS adoption due to selection on unobservables with time-varying effects. Waste generation in municipalities adopting this policy may have unobserved determinants that spawn diverging waste generation trends with respect to municipalities not adopting it. For example, while environmental consciousness may be fixed over time, the growing concern over the negative environmental and health impacts of waste may lead individuals to increase recycling or curb waste generation (see, for instance, EU's awareness-raising reports by O'Leary et al., 2017 and European Commission, 2010). The impacts of unobservables on waste generation may cause non-parallel trends in outcomes, invalidating the identification assumption of standard policy evaluations based on differencing out fixed individual characteristics with time-invariant effects, such as with fixed effects and difference-in-differences (DID) estimation (Gobillon and Magnac, 2016).====To account for time-varying effects of unobservables, we implement the Synthetic Control Method (SCM) (Abadie and Gardeazabal, 2003; Abadie et al., 2010). This method reconstructs the counterfactual outcomes using a combination of untreated municipalities with similar outcome trajectories that did not select into treatment, hence replicating the unobserved heterogeneity and allowing it to have time-varying effects. Several empirical applications in other areas of study have been implementing the SCM,==== but, in the authors’ best knowledge, this is the first paper doing so to evaluate waste pricing policies.====Secondly, this paper adds to the literature by studying the behavioral mechanisms behind the partial effects on the priced waste stream. When the relative price of unsorted waste increases, individuals may shift away from generating unsorted waste either by recycling more or by avoiding waste generation of any sort, e.g., by using less packaging.==== Thereby, this paper looks at which behavioral response prevails by evaluating policy causal effects separately for total, recycling and unsorted waste.====Our results indicate policy effects of sizable magnitude and changes in waste generation behavior. Unsorted waste generation fell immediately after UPS implementation and levelled off after around two years, with an average decrease of 37.5% in the post-treatment period. This partial effect seems to have been largely driven by waste avoidance and a relatively smaller increase in recycling, with total waste decreasing by 8.6% and recycling waste increasing by 6.1%. Placebo tests show that the unsorted waste reduction is strongly significant, while weaker and no significance is found for the causal effects on total and recycling waste, respectively. Finally, we show that the use of the SCM rather than a DID approach is justified in this application because the parallel trend assumption needed for the validity of the latter is violated. The successful reconstruction of the unobserved heterogeneity by the SCM, on the other hand, allowed to control for its time-varying effects.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a brief review of the related literature on UPS, and discusses potential methodological shortcomings. Section 3 outlines the SCM used to estimate the policy causal effects under study. Background and data are described in Section 4.

This explains the finding of a prior study showing a link between drilling and indoor radon.","France, Germany, and Scotland, along with many state and local governments in the U.S., have banned extraction of oil and gas using high-volume hydraulic fracturing despite the jobs and income that it can bring (Marchand and Weber, 2018). The bans reflect concerns that fracking will expose local residents to contaminated water and air. Empirical research appears to support the concern, showing statistical relationships between exposure to wells and health outcomes like infant birth weight, asthma, and hospitalizations related to issues such as cancer (Jemielita et al., 2015; Rasmussen et al., 2016; Hill, 2018).====A critique of studies linking wells to health, however, is that they do not measure actual exposure to harmful liquids or gases and therefore lack a mechanism that explains any statistical links.==== More generally, Werner et al. (2015) notes that studies linking fracking to health can vary in methodological rigor. Many do not assess the plausibility of the assumptions needed for identifying causal effects or rigorously probe the robustness of their findings (McKenzie et al., 2014; Stacy et al., 2015; Rasmussen et al., 2016; Casey et al., 2016; Finkel, 2016; Busby and Mangano, 2017).====We contribute to the literature on the localized effects of fracking by considering whether it increases the concentration of radon gas–a known carcinogen–inside nearby buildings. Radon occurs in high concentrations deep in the subsurface where shale gas is extracted, and one published study found that exposure to unconventional gas wells was associated with higher indoor radon levels (Casey et al., 2015).====Our empirical approach fully exploits the spatial and temporal variation in radon testing and well drilling in Pennsylvania, with its more than 7000 wells and hundreds of thousands of radon tests in shale areas. The approach builds on several rigorous studies of localized effects of fracking (Muehlenbachs et al., 2015; Currie et al., 2017; Hill, 2018) and illustrates estimation of treatment effects where treatment is continuous (number of wells) and varies in intensity (distance to the wells) and in duration of exposure (the time since wells were drilled). The approach can reveal how a potential effect of fracking varies non-linearly with the distance between the well and test site and, holding distance constant, the time between drilling and testing.====Our analysis reveals no cause for concern about fracking and radon in nearby buildings, with the main model showing a precisely estimated zero effect of a nearby well. Energy firms drilled wells in places with higher pre-existing radon levels, which, if ignored, makes it appear that wells within 2 km increase indoor radon but wells at least 3 km away do not.

When the price falls, a solar consumer might consume more electricity than before – a solar rebound effect. We provide the first empirical evidence of residential solar rebound effects in the U.S. We use household level hourly and daily electricity meter data as well as hourly solar panel electricity generation data from 277 solar homes and about 4000 non-solar homes from 2013 to 2017 in Phoenix Arizona. Using matching methods and a fixed effects panel regression approach, we find that when solar electricity generation increases by 1 kWh, solar homes increase their total electricity consumption by 0.18 kWh. This indicates that solar rebound effects are estimated at 18%. Building upon our theoretical framework, the increase in ==== from solar panel adoption is estimated at $972/yr.","Distributed solar energy technologies such as rooftop and ground-mounted solar photovoltaics (PV) are widely regarded as key options for reducing society's reliance on fossil-fuel-generated electricity, the associated carbon emissions, and other environmental challenges (Marszal et al., 2011; Parida et al., 2011). There have been many policy discussions centered around distributed solar PV. On the benefit side, policy evaluations involve increased consumer surplus from saved energy bills and a positive impact on the environment (Chan and Gillingham, 2015). There are also debates about potentially negative impacts. Electric utilities need to collect sufficient revenue to recoup the upfront cost of capital investment in infrastructure. The transmission and distribution system is sized to meet customer maximum demand. The continuously increasing penetration of distributed solar energy technologies has raised significant challenges for the utilities to recoup their upfront cost from kilowatt-hour (kWh) sales due to an electricity sales reduction (McLaren et al., 2015; Hledik, 2014). Electric utilities need to raise their electricity tariffs to deal with such issues (Johnson et al., 2017). This then leads to an ongoing discussion on the distributional impact between solar consumers who are generally associated with higher socio-income status and non-solar customers who are generally not (Liang et al., 2018a).====A central part of the policy discussion is that solar customers reduce their energy bills from the electric utilities. Naturally, one can use the amount of electricity generated by solar panels to calculate the amount of reduction in electricity purchase from the utilities. This is what has been done in existing integrated assessment and simulation models such as Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM). If electricity consumers always consume the same amount of power, then any increase in power generation by solar panels reduces the need for conventional power generation. This one for one displacement effect is unlikely to unfold because solar adoption effectively reduces consumers’ energy bills and thus the average price that consumers pay for electricity. When the average electricity price falls, solar consumers might consume more electricity than before. In the language of energy economics, this triggers a rebound effect.====Rebound effects are widely discussed in energy efficiency literature (e.g., Liang et al., 2018b; Gillingham et al., 2016; Azevedo, 2014; Qiu, 2014; Thomas and Azevedo, 2013). However residential solar literature has not quantified such rebound effects except for one Australian study (Deng and Newton, 2017). Our unique contributions compared to Deng and Newton (2017) are four folds. First, we are the first to examine the rebound effects of net-metered solar consumers while Deng and Newton only look at gross-metered solar homes. These two types of solar customers might have different causal mechanisms for solar rebound effects. For gross-metered solar homes, solar customers export all their solar electricity in return for feed-in credits, while for net-metered customers, solar electricity is first being consumed by the customer and if there is any solar electricity left it can be sold back to the grid. As a result, the main cause of rebound for gross-metered solar customers is the perceived increase in “income” from selling all solar electricity while the main cause of rebound for net-metered solar customers is the reduced perceived average price from consuming “free” solar electricity. In the U.S. more than 40 states have net-metering policies, so our results have very important and broad policy implications. Second, the higher frequency data in our study enables us to use more flexible fixed effects to control for more confounding factors, such as using customer-year fixed effects to control for time-variant unobservables for individual consumer while it is impossible to use such fixed effects for quarterly data in Deng and Newton. Third, the hourly level analysis in our paper enables us to evaluate more precisely the environmental benefit of solar panels using actual change in hourly electricity needed from the grid, because the marginal damage factors from environmental pollutants associated with electricity supply differ by hour of day. Last but not the least, we provide the first empirical evidence of solar rebound effects in the U.S. while Deng and Newton look at Australian consumers.====To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first that uses high frequency residential meter data as well as solar meter data at the household level of a large sample of representative households to provide precise estimation of rebound effects for net-metered solar homes in the U.S. We answer two research questions. First, how large is the rebound effect of residential solar customers? Second, after considering rebound effects, what are the increased consumer surplus and the value of reduction in environmental pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions from solar panel adoption?====We first build a consumer-theoretical framework to show the relationships among price elasticity of electricity demand, solar electricity generation, response to solar generation, and change in consumer surplus. Then we use household level hourly and daily electricity meter data as well as hourly solar panel electricity generation data from 277 solar homes and about 4000 non-solar homes from 2013 to 2017 in the Phoenix metropolitan area of Arizona to provide empirical evidence. We rely on matching method and fixed effects panel regression to control for potential endogeneity issues. Results show that on average, when solar electricity generation increases by 1 kWh, solar homes increase their total electricity consumption by 0.18 kWh, implying that solar rebound effects are 18%. We show theoretically that this response to solar electricity generation should be equal to price elasticity of electricity consumption. We also find that consumers located in more liberal neighborhoods experience lower rebound effects, suggesting that environmental awareness plays a role. The main policy implication of our paper is that when evaluating the impacts of solar panel adoption and designing the appropriate rate structure, policy makers and utilities should consider the extra amount of electricity consumed by solar customers due to rebound effects. We discuss in more details our contributions to existing literature in Section 7.",Quantifying the rebound effects of residential solar panel adoption,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069618309203,18 June 2019,2019,Research Article,297.0

Using US county-level crop and wind capacity data, I examine the effects of wind energy development on crop yields, controlling for time-invariant county characteristics and state-level annual shocks. I find robust evidence that counties with increased wind power development have also experienced increased corn and other crop yields, such that an additional 100 MW of wind capacity increases county yields by roughly 1%. At recent prices, this implies a more than $5 dollar per megawatt-hour local benefit, corresponding to several hundred million dollars in annual benefits.","As the use of renewable energy sources has grown globally, there is increased academic interest and public debate regarding potential externalities associated with these various technologies. One unique feature of wind power as a form of renewable electricity is that it is spatially diffuse and sited on properties with other land uses (often agriculture), raising the possibility of wind farm spillovers on co-located land uses. One potential externality that has not been considered in the economics literature is the effect of wind farms on crop outcomes due to “microclimate” effects (Rajewski et al. 2013, 2014; Armstrong et al., 2014). The exact mechanisms underlying these microclimate effects are discussed in more detail below, but briefly they arise from changes in local temperature, moisture and CO==== levels due to vertical mixing, turbulence, and wakes created by wind turbines that extend well-beyond their local footprint (Fitch et al., 2013a, Lundquist et al., 2019). Thus, while wind turbines are often viewed as a key technology to address concerns of global climate change, in a somewhat ironic twist they in turn affect local climate, and the consequences of these microclimate effects are poorly understood.====Given climate variables such as temperature and precipitation affect crop productivity and farmland values (Schlenker et al. 2005, 2006; Deschênes and Greenstone, 2007; Fisher et al., 2012), and given wind farms create microclimate effects, then wind farms in turn may affect crop yields. As such, this paper asks: Do microclimates created by wind farms affect local crop yields, and what is the direction and magnitude of the effect? Understanding the sign and magnitude of these microclimate effects on crops has potentially important welfare and policy implications for renewable energy. U.S. electricity generation from wind has grown from less than 1% in 2007 to more than 6% in 2017 and a proper accounting of spillover effects from these growing renewable technologies can aid policymakers in assessing whether policies that support that growth should be continued, curtailed or expanded.====While the natural science literature has found evidence of microclimate changes due to wind farms, the net effect on crops is still an open question. In an ideal experiment, one would want to compare two otherwise identical areas, whereby one area has a wind farm installed. Comparing crop yields in both areas before and after the wind installation would yield the net effect on crop yields from microclimates created by the wind farm.==== Panel econometric techniques are well-suited to approximating this thought experiment - by controlling for time-invariant county characteristics, state-level annual shocks, and annual weather fluctuations at the county level, the effect of wind farms on crop yields can be plausibly identified.====A county-level annual panel of yield, production, acreage, wind capacity, and weather from 1997 to 2013 in the US for corn, soy, hay and wheat crops is used for this analysis. These four crops are the largest in terms of total planted acreage and provide broad geographical coverage. Across a variety of specifications, I find robust evidence that increases in county-level wind capacity lead to increased county-level corn yields. Roughly speaking, the addition of a 100 MW (MW) wind farm in an average county increases county-level corn yields between 0.5% and 1.5% depending on the specification. I find similar, though less robust, evidence for increased soy and hay yields of a similar magnitude. By contrast, no effect is found on wheat yields. In a series of extensions, I examine how the wind capacity effect varies with wind speeds, turbine hub height, terrain, wind farm distance to county border, and wind direction. Results are consistent with the underlying physical processes of microclimates and are difficult to reconcile with alternative mechanisms.====While these estimated microclimate effects may seem relatively small, at recent prices they amount to an annual local benefit of nearly $400 million dollars, with roughly 3/4 of that benefit derived from increased corn yields. On a per megawatt-hour (MWh) basis, this implies a local benefit of more than $5 dollars per MWh. While it may be tempting to consider this benefit as a positive externality to be potentially addressed by policy, the policy implications are slightly more nuanced. To the extent the microclimate benefits fall within the immediate footprint of the wind farm, these benefits should be internalized by the leasing and bargaining process between landowners and wind developers, and thus there is little rationale for policy interventions beyond providing information for the relevant parties. However, to the extent these benefits spillover to neighboring farms, then these benefits would constitute a positive externality that state lawmakers may wish to consider when crafting renewable policies pertaining to wind.====This analysis contributes to a growing literature on the externalities of renewable energy, and wind energy in particular. Much of this initial literature has focused on the emission savings from these renewable technologies and the extent to which such savings justify policy interventions to support and expand renewable energy.==== A number of papers have also examined how wind farm externalities such as noise impacts and visual disamenities are capitalized into housing prices and local property values (Heintzelman and Tuttle, 2012; Lang et al., 2014; Jensen et al., 2014; Gibbons, 2015; Dröes and Koster, 2016). Furthermore, because wind farms can diminish wind speeds for significant distances downwind, upwind wind farms may impose a negative externality on neighboring wind farms in their wake (Kaffine and Worley, 2010; Rule, 2012). To my knowledge this is the first econometric analysis of microclimate effects from wind turbines and their impact on crop yields.====It should be noted the primary limitation of this analysis is that, due to data availability, the unit of observation is at the county level while the actual microclimate effect on yields is likely at the sub-county level and varies spatially, potentially spilling across county borders. Nonetheless, the county-level estimates provided by this analysis are a useful measure of the microclimate externalities generated by wind farms.",Microclimate effects of wind farms on local crop yields,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069618306545,7 June 2019,2019,Research Article,298.0

The analysis finds a robust, U-shaped relationship between temperature and mortality rates, indicating that extremely cold or hot temperatures lead to excess deaths. The heat-related (cold-related) effect is 3.5 times (3.2 times) as large as previous findings that used U.S. data, and it is especially large for the elderly population, mainly due to excess deaths caused by cardiovascular diseases. Applying these results to climate change predictions from Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model shows that by 2061–2080 the annual mortality rate is likely to increase by 14.2% if global ==== continue to rise throughout the 21st century, the estimated health cost of which is around 0.98 trillion Chinese Yuan per year. The paper also explores households’ adaptation behaviors to extreme temperatures. It finds that although urban households adaptively increase energy consumption when they are exposed to cold temperatures and purchase more air conditioners on hot and cold days, rural households are unresponsive to temperature fluctuations. This finding implies that rural people may be more resource constrained and suffer more when extreme temperatures occur.","The last century witnessed an increase in average temperature and extreme weather events, such as the frequency of heat waves (IPCC, 2013). It has been suggested that climate change “is the biggest global health threat of the 21st century” and “threatens to undermine the last half century of gains in development and global health” (Costello et al., 2009; Watts et al., 2015).====Although many studies have examined climate impacts on human health,==== there has been little such research in developing countries (Deschênes, 2014).====Households in developing countries generally have limited income and resources with which to adapt to an increasingly severe climate. Therefore, it is important to understand the differences in how climate change influences human health in developing countries compared to developed countries and determine whether it is possible for households in developing countries to take effective actions to adapt. To address these issues, this study investigates the effects of weather, mainly measured by temperature, on the mortality rates of the Chinese population, as well as people's response to extreme temperatures, by focusing on the behavioral differences between rural and urban residents. The paper presents evidence of large distributional effects of weather change, not only across countries, but also within countries, between rural and urban areas.====Exposure to temperatures outside a certain range can pose a danger to human health and result in premature death, as the body has to work harder to maintain its stable core temperature.==== Extensive public health and epidemiology literature has studied the effect of extreme temperatures on human health by analyzing daily mortality counts (often for one city) in a Poisson regression framework. Most studies find a U-shaped relationship between temperature and mortality counts. That is, extremely high or extremely low temperature results in increased deaths.==== However, due to the short exposure window, the results found in these studies with daily data may be confounded by “harvesting” or delayed effects.==== Moreover, the outcome variable in these studies is the mortality count instead of the mortality rate, which can lead to severe endogeneity problems caused by migration if the total population is not controlled in the regression.====In contrast, recent economic studies on the health effects of weather change generally apply fixed-effect analysis based on monthly or annual mortality rates (rather than mortality counts) across larger geographical areas and over a longer time frame, allowing for richer variation in weather and a longer exposure window.==== To account for the nonlinearity of the temperature-mortality relationship, these studies often model temperature through temperature-day bins.==== This approach discretizes the daily temperature distribution and allows each temperature bin to have different impacts on mortality. However, the existing economic studies on the health effects of climate change, including Deschênes and Greenstone (2011), Barreca (2012), and Barreca et al. (2016), mainly use data from the United States. They consistently find a U-shaped relationship between temperature and mortality rate.====As far as we know, Burgess et al. (2014) is the only paper that uses data from a developing country, India, to study this issue. We add to this literature with the study on the world's largest developing country, China, which accounts for more than 18% of the world's population. Moreover, as the largest carbon emitter in the world, the Chinese government is undertaking aggressive policies to reduce carbon emissions, such as providing lavish subsidies for renewable energie (around 100 billion Chinese Yuan (CNY) per year) and establishing a national carbon trade market. This will be the world's largest carbon trade market. Understanding the effects of temperature change on human health in China is essential for cost-benefit analysis of such climate policies.====Following the temperature-day bins approach in this literature, we investigate the impacts of extreme temperatures on human health in China. Our analysis is based on a county-level panel of annual mortality rates during 2004–2012. The data are from the National Disease Surveillance Points (DSP) system, and daily weather outcomes are from the China Meteorological Data Sharing Service (CMDSS) system. We model temperature distribution through certain bins and when estimating the relationship between temperature and mortality rate, we also control for other weather variables, including precipitation and specific humidity, in addition to other commonly used control variables.====Our results show that there is a statistically significant and robust U-shaped relationship between mortality and daily temperature, indicating that extremely high or low temperatures are associated with excess mortality rates. For example, we find that an additional day with a mean temperature exceeding 90 °F (relative to a day in the 50℉-60 °F range) would lead to an increase of 0.6% in the annual mortality rate, which is equivalent to 3.31 more annual deaths per 100,000 persons. Similarly, an additional day with a mean temperature below 10 °F would lead to an increase of 0.4% in the annual mortality rate, which is equivalent to 2.20 more annual deaths per 100,000 persons. The annual deaths per 100,000 persons due to heat-related effects (cold-related effects) are almost 3.5 times (3.2 times) as large as those suggested by Deschênes and Greenstone (2011). Age and cause-specific estimates show that the heat and cold effects are the largest for the elderly, mainly through excess deaths caused by cardiovascular diseases. Coupled with the climate change model, Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model, version 2, Earth System (HadGEM2-ES), we predict that by 2061–2080, the annual mortality rate in China will increase by 14.2% if global greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise throughout the 21st century under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5, which could cost 0.98 trillion CNY per year in health losses.====Taking advantage of the rich information in the data, we further investigate households’ adaptation behaviors in response to extreme temperatures. The literature suggests that households respond to extreme temperatures by using adaptation strategies, including change in energy consumption (Deschênes and Greenstone, 2011; Barreca, 2012; Li et al., 2019), outdoor activities (Graff Zivin and Neidell, 2014), geographical mobility (Deschênes and Moretti, 2009), and air conditioning (AC) adoption (Barreca et al., 2016; Heutel et al., 2017). Among these behaviors, AC usage seems to play a vital role in adaptation. Barreca et al. (2016) conclude that, in the United States, almost the entire decline in heat-related fatalities since 1960 can be explained by the diffusion of residential AC. Heutel et al. (2017) also report that residential AC adoption can explain nearly all the regional differences in heat-related deaths in the United States. As stated in Deschênes (2014), AC is “the form of adaptation to climate change that is by far the most cited in both the broad policy and academic literature,” because it can regulate the ambient indoor temperature directly. However, due to the unavailability of data on AC usage and ownership, previous studies only drew inferences from residential energy consumption.====In this paper, we study residential energy consumption and AC purchases and investigate the behavioral difference between urban and rural residents. Auffhammer (2014) studies the impact of temperature on AC adoption using provincial data in China, but the study only focuses on urban areas. Moreover, it uses average monthly temperature instead of daily temperature, so that temperature can only enter the regressions linearly. In this paper, we not only allow nonlinearity of the relationship between temperature and AC adoption, but also consider the difference between urban and rural areas. We further use both provincial data and household survey data to examine the temperature–AC adoption relationship in China. Our results show that households take adaptive measures in response to uncomfortable weather by consuming more energy and purchasing more AC. However, these adaptive behaviors exist only among urban residents; rural residents do not respond at all. Because rural residents tend to be poorer, it is quite possible that temperature change will have a larger impact on mortality rates in rural areas.====We believe this paper contributes to the literature in at least three aspects. First, it is one of the few economic studies that use data from developing countries to investigate the health effects of temperature change. Considering the large size of China's population and carbon emissions, the study has important policy implications, especially given our results showing that the health impact of extreme temperatures on Chinese residents is much larger than that on residents living in developed countries, represented by the United States. Second, studying the impact of temperatures on the purchase of AC contributes to the existing literature that investigates adaptive behaviors to weather change. Third, we study the adaptation strategies in urban and rural areas separately. In most developing countries, the inequality between urban and rural areas is prominent. Examining the difference in adaptation measures between urban and rural households helps us understand the distributional effects of temperature change and therefore provides a reference for policy makers to make relevant public investments in the right places.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the data sources in detail. Section 3 investigates the temperature-mortality relationship. Section 4 studies how people adapt to temperature shocks. Section 5 concludes the paper.",Temperature effects on mortality and household adaptation: Evidence from China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069618304054,7 June 2019,2019,Research Article,299.0

The effect on ==== of lower storage costs depends on the interactions between storage and the entire grid. The literature has disagreed on the role of storage in reducing emissions. In this paper we present a stylized model, which suggests that the effect of storage costs on emissions depends on the supply responsiveness of both fossil and renewable generators. Under common conditions in the United States, lower storage costs are more likely to reduce emissions when wind investment responds to equilibrium electricity prices and when solar investment does not. Simulations of a computational model of grid investment and operation confirm these intuitions. Moreover, because of its effect on coal and natural gas–fired supply responsiveness, introducing a carbon dioxide emissions price may increase the likelihood that lower storage costs reduce emissions.","In the absence of policy intervention, private decision makers do not consider the external costs of greenhouse gas emissions, such as using electricity generated by fossil fuel combustion. Standard economic theory suggests that setting an emissions price equal to social damages, via either an emissions tax or cap-and-trade, is the welfare-maximizing approach to addressing this market failure. However, policymakers seeking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions have demonstrated a preference for subsidizing low-emitting technologies rather than fully pricing emissions. A vast array of explicit and implicit subsidies for low-emitting technologies exists, such as renewables tax credits and requirements that renewables provide a specified fraction of electricity generation. Although some policymakers have adopted an emissions price, the price rarely if ever fully internalizes the costs of greenhouse gas emissions. For example, recent attempts to reduce US electricity sector emissions would have imposed an emissions price of approximately $10 per ton of carbon dioxide (CO====; Energy Information Administration (EIA) 2014), which is likely to be substantially lower than the external cost of emissions (Greenstone et al., 2013; Nordhaus, 2014).====Several recent articles argue that subsidizing low-emitting technologies is not economically efficient. Subsidizing the adoption of low or zero-emissions technologies reduces the private costs of adopting these technologies. However, Holland et al. (2009), Fell and Linn (2013), and others show that these policies can have ambiguous effects on emissions and social welfare. For example, subsidizing wind- and solar-powered electricity generators can reduce electricity prices, increasing consumption and generation from fossil fuel–fired generators. This effect can offset the emissions reductions from such policies, reducing efficiency compared with an emissions price.====Under the rationale of subsidizing low-emitting technologies, subsidies for research and development (R&D) and adoption of large-scale electricity storage are also becoming more widespread. For example, since 2009 the US Department of Energy has provided roughly $200 million in funding for storage R&D. Storage subsidies are commonly supported by the view—which many recent studies (e.g., de Sisternes et al., 2016) have largely confirmed—that electricity storage reduces the costs of achieving very high levels of renewables generation and limiting greenhouse gas emissions, as well as providing other benefits to the electricity system. Because electricity production from wind- and solar-powered generators is more difficult to control than production from conventional technologies, integrating large amounts of wind and solar increases the challenge of balancing electricity demand and supply. Storage can address this challenge by charging the storage device when electricity supply is abundant relative to demand, and discharging when supply is scarce. According to this view, subsidizing storage R&D and adoption reduces the costs of integrating renewables and reduces emissions (or, alternatively, reduces the cost of meeting an emissions objective).====However, Carson and Novan (2013) and Graff Zivin et al. (2014) provide an alternative view of storage. They show that adding an incremental amount of storage can increase greenhouse gas emissions by causing a shift in generation from lower-to higher-emissions sources, such as from natural gas– to coal-fired generation. Thus, a central question for storage policies is whether anticipated reductions in the cost of storage will reduce emissions—that is, whether the widespread view is valid that storage facilitates emissions reductions. The literature has provided conflicting views on this question.====We reconcile these opposing views of storage by taking an alternative approach, in which we consider potentially large amounts of storage and renewables capacity added to the existing grid, and analyze the effects of storage costs on emissions. Previous studies differ in the time horizon, either considering an incremental amount of storage added to the existing grid (e.g., Carson and Novan, 2013) or redesigning the entire power system in the long run (e.g., de Sisternes et al., 2016). A short-run analysis is confined to the interaction between storage and existing generators, and cannot assess whether storage reduces the cost of integrating renewables. In contrast, we consider the medium run, a timeframe of 10–20 years, and include the interaction between storage and investment in new electricity generators. The medium run, rather than the long run, is the relevant timeframe for studying current policies that affect storage costs and near-term investment in generation and storage capacity. We focus on renewables investment and hold fixed the available capacity of natural gas and coal-fired generation. This assumption is consistent with our observation that for the range of storage costs that we consider and the implied levels of storage investment, storage affects the potential profitability of wind and solar-powered generators much more than it affects the profitability of existing or potential new fossil fuel-fired units.====While most other studies analyze the effects of an exogenous increase in storage capacity (e.g., Walawalkar et al., 2007; Sioshansi et al., 2009; Nyamdash et al., 2010), we consider a context in which storage investment depends on storage costs and other market factors. This focus is motivated by several considerations. First, in practice, storage investment depends on decisions made by individual investors (in some cases with regulatory oversight) in response to market conditions, but most previous studies have treated storage as exogenous to the model. Second, the focus on storage costs is relevant to storage policies, which primarily reduce storage costs in the short run (via investment incentives) and the long run (via R&D subsidies). Third, partly but not entirely because of storage policy, technological innovation over the coming years is likely to reduce storage costs (Kintner-Meyer et al., 2010). In the context of declining costs, the most relevant question for the future of storage is how the anticipated reduction in storage costs will affect emissions and other outcomes.====We argue that the effect of storage costs on emissions depends on the responsiveness of generation technologies to electricity prices. We focus on storage used for arbitrage purposes, charging when wholesale electricity prices are low and discharging when prices are high (wholesale prices are the prices received by electricity generators supplying electricity to retailers or utilities). We use a simple, stylized model of a wholesale power market that generalizes Carson and Novan (2013) to include investments in wind and solar power generation. The model illustrates intuitively why the effect of storage costs on emissions depends on relative supply responsiveness—mathematically, the derivative of generation with respect to electricity price—of fossil fuel–fired and renewables generation plants. We confirm this intuition using a computational model calibrated to the Texas power system.====More specifically, we begin by noting that storage charging and discharging raises equilibrium prices during what would otherwise be low-price periods and reduces prices during what would otherwise be high-price periods; in the extreme case of free storage and no losses, equilibrium prices are equal across periods. Storage therefore has two effects on operation and investment of generators. The first is that storage raises generation from existing fossil-fired generators in low price periods and reduces generation from existing fossil-fired generators in high-price periods. As we show empirically for Texas, coal-fired generation is typically more price responsive than is natural gas–fired generation during low-price periods, whereas natural gas–fired generation is typically more price responsive than is coal-fired generation during high-price periods. Importantly, this is true for Texas even given the decline in natural gas prices that occurred after 2008. Therefore, reducing storage costs raises storage capacity and causes a shift from natural gas– to coal-fired generation. Because coal-fired generation is more emissions intensive than natural gas–fired generation, given estimated price responsiveness, a decrease in storage costs raises emissions; this is the effect that Carson and Novan (2013) identify.====The second effect is novel: it is the response of renewables investment to storage. For wind- and solar-powered generators, it is useful to focus on the responsiveness of investment with respect to the generation-weighted average electricity price. Renewables generation may be positively or negatively correlated with electricity price changes caused by storage, depending on the availability of the underlying resource and other factors. For example, in many regions wind generation peaks during the nighttime, when electricity demand and prices tend to be low. In that case, storage would increase nighttime electricity prices, and wind generation would be positively correlated with the electricity price changes caused by adding storage. This situation could apply to solar at high levels of solar penetration. When renewables generation—either wind or solar—is positively correlated with electricity price changes, lower storage costs raise the generation-weighted average electricity price and therefore renewables investment, displacing fossil fuel–fired generation and emissions. In this case, the more price responsive is renewables investment, the more likely that lower storage costs reduce emissions.====In contrast, when renewables generation is negatively correlated with electricity price changes caused by storage, reducing storage costs reduces the generation-weighted average electricity price, causing renewables investment to decrease. Lower renewables investment implies lower renewables generation, which raises fossil fuel–fired generation and emissions. Therefore, the more price responsive is renewables investment, the more a reduction in storage costs reduces renewables investment and raises fossil generation and emissions. This is often the case for solar, particularly at low levels of penetration. In short, the effect of storage costs on renewables investment depends on the correlation between generation from the renewables and storage-induced electricity price changes.====Thus, the stylized model suggests that the effect of storage costs on emissions depends on the price responsiveness of fossil fuel–fired and renewables generation. We confirm this intuition using a more detailed optimization model that endogenizes storage operation, dispatch of coal and natural gas–fired generators, and investment in storage, wind, and solar. The model accounts for the nondispatchability of renewables and includes supply curves for renewables and fossil fuel–fired generators. The model is calibrated to reproduce observed short-run substitution between fuels and current long-run investment projections. Applying the model to the Texas power system (i.e., the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, ERCOT), we first consider the case of zero renewables investment, which is comparable to Carson and Novan (2013). We find that lower storage costs increase storage investment and raise emissions precisely for the reasons identified in the stylized model: coal-fired generation is more price responsive during low-price periods, and natural gas–fired generation is more price responsive during high-price periods. This relative supply responsiveness is true even accounting for the fact that current forecasts of natural gas prices cause many natural gas-fired units to have lower generation costs than coal-fired units.====As in much of the United States, in ERCOT wind generation is positively correlated with storage-induced electricity price changes, and solar generation is negatively correlated. If we allow for wind and solar investment, lower storage costs raise emissions, as in the case without investment. However, changes in the price responsiveness of wind and solar investment have the predicted effects: a reduction in storage costs is more likely to reduce emissions the more price responsive is wind investment, and a reduction in storage costs is less likely to reduce emissions the more price responsive is solar investment. These results demonstrate the importance of price responsiveness in determining the effects of storage costs on emissions. In regions other than ERCOT, solar generation may be negatively correlated with storage-induced electricity price changes. In that case, lower storage costs would be more likely to reduce emissions the more price-responsive is solar investment—but even in that case lower storage costs would not necessarily reduce emissions.====An extension of our stylized model suggests that a carbon price has an ambiguous effect on the likelihood that lower storage costs reduce emissions. On the one hand, the carbon price causes fossil fuel–fired generation to be more price responsive relative to wind generation, which reduces the likelihood that lower storage costs reduce emissions. On the other hand, the carbon price causes fossil fuel–fired generation to be more price responsive relative to solar generation, which raises the likelihood that a reduction in storage costs reduces emissions. In the baseline model calibration, adding a carbon price makes it more likely that lower storage costs reduce emissions.====Our paper contributes to the literature in several ways. First, we characterize an internally consistent set of supply conditions under which lower storage costs reduce carbon emissions. In contrast, Carson and Novan (2013) hold fixed renewables investment, and long-run studies do not characterize these supply conditions. Second, because wind investment responsiveness is central to the relationship between storage costs and emissions, we present the first attempt to estimate this responsiveness directly from observed investment decisions. By comparison, other studies rely on simulation-based cost estimates. Third, our computational model endogenizes investment in storage, wind, and solar capacity; previous studies have treated one or more of these as determined outside the model. This allows us to consider the question most relevant to storage policies: how a reduction in storage costs affects emissions, given the makeup of the existing grid.",Do lower electricity storage costs reduce greenhouse gas emissions?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069617304400,22 May 2019,2019,Research Article,300.0

Productivity improvements, when considered in isolation, may lead to greater economic growth and enhanced economic welfare. Demsetz (1967) argued that technological advance alters the net benefits of property right specification, generally so that property rights will be further specified to internalize new externalities that arise. The impact these newly specified property rights have on overall economic welfare will depend upon whether the regulated firms decide to forgo previously productive activities.====In the case of the shale revolution, there are numerous potential negative externalities associated with oil and gas production that can lead to changes in regulation. These include the possibility of polluting surface water and groundwater, degrading air quality, and spilling oil and waste (EPA, 2015; NETL, 2014). To mitigate the associated environmental externalities, many state and local governments in the U.S. are considering or have implemented stricter regulations on oil and gas drilling and production operations. Proponents of stronger regulations consider them necessary to protect the environment. Opponents claim that regulations can be overly burdensome and hinder oil and gas extraction. Policymakers in several state governments are faced with balancing the often competing goals of resource development and environmental quality. Compounding the difficulty of this task is uncertainty over the extent to which tighter regulations on oil and gas operations ultimately reduce drilling and production.====This paper exploits a quasi-natural experiment to assesses the effects of stricter regulations on oil well drilling and production in North Dakota (ND) using regression discontinuity (RD) and difference-in-differences methodology. In 2012, ND tightened regulations that effectively increased the fixed cost of drilling for and producing oil. The regulation change, which is detailed in Section 2, included an increase in the well bonding requirements.==== The boundary between ND and Montana (MT) divides several oil deposits, and many unconventional oil wells have been drilled near the border. MT did not implement the same regulations and serves as a control group in the analysis. While no control group is a perfect match to the treated group, we restrict the geographic area of study to a narrow window around the ND-MT boundary to ensure the treatment and control groups share many characteristics that influence drilling and production, such as geology, infrastructure, and geography. The outcomes analyzed here are drilling, production, and firm exit.====Valid estimation of an RD requires that the outcome is continuous around the treatment discontinuity point and that the discontinuity point is exogenously set. A number of different functional forms, both parametric and non-parametric, and bandwidths are used to ensure that any discontinuity in the outcome found at the ND-MT border is not due to misspecification of the data around the border. Given that the ND-MT border was set in 1863, when the U.S. acquired the Idaho Territories and set the end of the Dakota Territory at the 27th meridian west of Washington D.C., there is little concern that the border was set based on concerns for oil drilling. To further ensure that any discontinuity found at the ND-MT border is attributable to the regulation, this analysis utilizes data on drilling before the change in regulation for both ND and MT.====Results find no statistical change in the pace of drilling wells after the ND regulations came into effect. This result is consistent across multiple specifications, including different bandwidths and functional forms of the data. Production of oil did not on average decline with the imposition of the ND regulations, however the distribution of production amongst firms did change. Results consistently find reduced production from operators in the first quartile of production in the year previous to the regulation and increased production from operators in the fourth quartile.==== The reduction in production for small operators in ND after the regulation went in effect, relative to production in MT, is about 0.5%. The reduction in production from small operators seems to be coming from operator exit. Regression and duration models show an increased propensity for small operators to leave the area of analysis while no statistical change is found for larger operators.====Taken together, these results imply that while the regulation had little, if any, impact on drilling and production, it did redistribute rents within the industry. In this light, the regulations look like larger operators were able to raise the costs of smaller competitors in order improve larger operators profitability, a la Salop and Scheffman (1983). With fewer small operators in the market for completion services (after drilling a well the operator hires a firm to “complete” the well by putting sand and other chemicals down the well to allow the oil to escape the rock), it is possible that the remaining operators have some oligopsonistic power when bargaining for completion services. Operators would use this power by offering to purchase less completions (in order to pay a lower price) and thus there would be an extended time period in between when drilling ends and production starts. A difference-in-difference analysis finds that wells in ND after the regulations went in place take three more weeks to start production after drilling has ended. A final component of the analysis estimates if the regulation had an effect on the occurrence of environmental incidents (e.g. oil spills). Data on incidents at the well level are only available for North Dakota, so an OLS regression with operator fixed effects and a time trend is performed, and the results suggest a relationship between the regulation change and fewer incidents.====The bulk of previous literature estimating the impact of regulation on industry behavior comes from the manufacturing industry. Henderson (1996), Greenstone (2002), Walker (2013), and Becker and Henderson (2000) all use air pollution policy to determine how the manufacturing industry altered its activity when environmental regulations increased. While manufacturing and oil drilling as industries have some similarities, there are important differences. Oil drilling has very mobile capital (rigs), which can move much quicker than a manufacturing plant, but the geology of a place is of paramount importance.==== Ryan (2012) looks at the impact of raising fixed costs in the cement industry and finds a large welfare loss to consumers through increased market power of incumbent producers. Lade and Rudik (2017) analyze the impact of gas flaring restrictions on the ND oil industry and speculate that the form of regulation may hinder small firms ability to stay in business.====The part of the literature most similar to the analysis undertaken here is Boomhower, 2019, which examines the effects of well bond requirements implemented in Texas in 2002 on oil and gas production, firm exit, and environmental incidents. Boomhower (2019) uses a unique feature in the time dimension of the bonding requirement change while this analysis uses the physical state border and a difference-in-difference set-up to estimate the impact of increased regulations. A principal difference of this paper is that it evaluates the effects of well bonding on new investment decisions (i.e. the drilling of new wells) for unconventional wells. Moreover, the wells drilled in Montana and North Dakota have a horizontal portion and are vertically deeper (∼20,000 feet) than many of the conventional wells drilled in Texas (∼3000 feet) and thus more expensive. Bonding an unconventional well thus makes up a smaller share of the total cost of a well relative to the conventional wells studied in Boomhower (2019), and the effects of higher fixed costs due to regulation may be limited in this case. On the other hand, oil producers had fewer onshore drilling options (other than Texas) in 2002 relative to the potential for ND drillers to move to MT in order to avoid the increased regulations. Many of the findings between the two papers are similar; a small impact on production that is concentrated in small firm's production losses and exits. We find a larger overall impact on exit (8% vs 6%) however Boomhower (2019) finds a larger probability of exit for small firms than we do (around 15% in the Texas example compared to 4% in ours).====Kim and Oliver (2017) look at changes to natural gas well regulations, including changes in well-bonding requirements, in Pennsylvania. They find that the increase in well bond requirements leads to a reduction in shale gas drilling. This result is counter to the results we find and those in Boomhower (2019), which is likely caused by fewer transportation options for gas (pipeline) relative to oil (pipeline, truck, rail) leading to more congestion possibilities in natural gas production. As a result of these transportation differences between oil and gas, it is likely that the results here would not transfer to shale gas plays.====As the results here are similar to that of other studies which show that geology and prices, less so taxes and other regulatory issues, are the main drivers of oil drilling decisions ((Boomhower, 2019; Kellogg et al., 2018; Brown et al., 2018)), the external validity of our analysis is not a strong concern. Additionally, the policies passed in ND dovetail similar policies that were passed across the US in light of the increased use of fracking to produce oil and gas (Zirogiannis et al., 2016). These results here are helpful to policymakers weighing the benefits and costs of further regulation in the oil and gas industry. It is quite common for industry associations to sponsor research that estimates the impacts regulation will have on the state or national economy. These estimates, by their nature, are prospective in that they predict how a proposed regulation will alter an industry and how that industry's change in behavior ripples through the economy. An analysis such as the one undertaken here provides a post-regulation evaluation of how the industry changed its behavior.",Effects of stricter environmental regulations on resource development,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069618303437,21 May 2019,2019,Research Article,301.0

This paper focuses on a specific case by investigating microcystin, a toxin produced by freshwater blue-green algal blooms. We exploit a natural experiment caused by a zebra mussel die-off in a large lake located in the state of Michigan, USA to identify changes in microcystin-related infant outcomes surrounding the lake. Using both the synthetic control method and a difference-in-differences strategy, we find that instances of low birth weight around the lake fell by 1.4 percentage points after lake water quality improved. Along the intensive margin, birth weight and length of gestation increased by 17.1 g and 0.47 weeks, respectively. Improvements to low birth weight result in $768,500 in average annual hospitalization cost savings. Many robustness and falsification tests are performed including using both annual and monthly data and accounting for possible weather confounders and seasonality. Results suggest that microcystin can affect infant health at levels below current water advisory guidelines.","Lakes and reservoirs provide a variety of ecosystem services, from sources of municipal water and seafood to recreation destinations and wildlife habitats. An overarching concern about many lakes, however, is their water quality, which is often an important metric of interest for human health and environmental quality reasons (e.g., Griffiths et al., 2012; Keeler et al., 2012; Schwarzenbach et al., 2010). Regulations, such as the Clean Water Act in the US, led to substantial surface water quality improvements in the 20th century (Keiser and Shapiro, 2017). Despite these actions though, many pollutants and toxins remain. The US EPA estimates that 28% of assessed US lakes and reservoirs are “impaired”, meaning that their water quality does not meet Clean Water Act standards (US EPA, 2011).====In light of several high-profile incidents, water-borne toxins produced by blue-green algal blooms have become a leading lake water quality concern (Brooks et al., 2016). For example, in 2014, the city of Toledo, Ohio (population >275,000) was forced to shut off its Lake Erie-sourced municipal water supplies for several days due to elevated concentrations of algae-produced water toxins around the city's water intake (Frankel, 2014). While it is widely recognized that algal bloom toxins are harmful to health (e.g., Hilborn et al., 2014), there are unfortunately a lack of causally interpretable effect estimates outside of laboratory experiments. In particular, the extant literature on algal bloom health impacts is largely correlational and suffers from well-known confounding biases (US EPA, 2015). This is troubling because climate change is expected to continue exacerbating lake algal blooms in the future (Heisler et al., 2008) and because a better understanding of algal bloom health externalities would aid management strategies for water pollutants and toxins that are being developed by economists (e.g., Carson and LaRiviere, 2017; Ribaudo et al., 2014).====To address this knowledge gap, this work exploits a natural experiment that resulted in a dramatic decline in algal bloom-produced toxins in a large freshwater lake in the Midwest US. We focus on the class of pollutants known as microcystins, which are the most commonly studied toxins produced by blue-green algal blooms (====). Microcystin is of interest to us because past laboratory evidence suggests that exposure to it can impair embryonic development in mammals and lead to birth abnormalities through inhibition of serine/threonine protein phosphatases (Bu et al., 2006). In addition, past correlational evidence in the field suggests that microcystin is harmful to the liver and the colon and can induce allergic reactions and gastrointestinal illness, which has the potential to adversely affect both mother and fetus (see for review US EPA, 2015). Moreover, microcystins are not regulated under the Clean Water Act.====Identification of the specific impact of microcystin on health is confounded by climate change, rising urban and agricultural nutrient runoff, and invasive species (discussed in more detail below), which have all contributed to increased algal blooms (and hence microcystin) in US lakes over the past few decades. Hence, a pure cross-sectional analysis would not provide a credible effect estimate. Ideally, to identify the causal effect of microcystin on health we would undertake an experiment where lake microcystin concentrations were randomly assigned across counties. Since this is not feasible (nor advisable), we use a natural experiment in the form of the sudden death of a majority of invasive zebra mussels in Gull Lake, Michigan, which led to a dramatic drop in lake microcystin levels, to explore infant health effects among mothers residing in counties adjacent to the lake. Importantly for identification purposes, other relevant pollutant concentrations remained constant over the study period, allowing us to isolate the microcystin specific health externality.====To improve the credibility of our estimates, we use the synthetic control method of Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003) and Abadie et al. (2010) to construct a data-driven counterfactual of infant health outcomes in non-Gull Lake counties (the control) that match infant health outcomes in Gull Lake counties (the treated) in the years prior to the zebra mussel population shock. To also take advantage of the rich individual birth data we have available to us, we augment our analysis with a more traditional difference-in-differences (DID) design.====Four conclusions arise. First, instances of low birth weight among infants born in Gull Lake counties fell by 1.4 percentage points from a mean of 8.1% in the years after the zebra mussel-induced shock to microcystin, relative to infants in other Michigan counties that contained zebra mussel-infested lakes, but where no die-off occurred. No significant effect is observed for premature births. Along the intensive margin, birth weight increased by 17.1 g from a mean of 3323.5 g and the gestation period increased by 0.47 weeks (∼3.3 days) from a mean of 38.8 weeks. Second, a “v-shaped” low birth weight effect curve is observed over the post-treatment period, suggestive of improvements in low birth weight for the first few years after the shock, preceded by a gradual reversion back to pre-treatment levels. This mirrors the change in microcystin levels in Gull Lake, which declined and then increased as zebra mussel populations rebounded 3–5 years after the initial shock. Third, observed improvements to low birth weight in Gull Lake counties resulted in $768,500 in average annual hospitalization cost savings. Finally, annual microcystin concentrations in Gull Lake never exceeded US EPA water advisory guidelines for infants. Thus, these results suggest that microcystin can affect infant health even at levels below existing advisory guidelines.====The casual interpretation of our results is strengthened by the following additional findings: (i) we show that the fall in Gull Lake microcystin levels is concurrent with the zebra mussel population shock ==== observed changes in infant health; (ii) an internal validity test shows that changing mother and infant sociodemographic characteristics cannot explain the observed findings; (iii) flexible controls for temperature and robustness checks that account for seasonality rule out weather changes as the causal mechanism for the observed effects; (iv) there is no effect of the mussel shock on infant health prior to when it actually occurred; (v) we present evidence showing that other toxins remained constant in Gull Lake over our study period, and; (vi) a randomization inference permutation test shows that the magnitude of observed effects cannot be replicated by applying placebo treatments to the control counties.====This work contributes to two branches of the economics literature. First, it adds to the literature on invasive species health externalities by providing the first of its kind causally-consistent evidence of a link between zebra mussels and infant health. This follows on the heels of recent literature on non-aquatic invasives and health (e.g., Jones and McDermott, 2018; Frank, 2017; Jones, 2017). Second, this work contributes to the growing literature on water quality and health that uses empirically credible designs to provide causally interpretable effect estimates (e.g., Grossman and Slusky, 2018; Lai, 2017; Brainerd and Menon, 2014; Do et al., in press). As our understandings of coupled human and natural systems continue to grow, there is a need to explore the complex ways in which largely unregulated water pollutants affect human health, and especially infant health, which is an important determinant of future labor market and educational attainment outcomes (Currie et al., 2014).",Infant health impacts of freshwater algal blooms: Evidence from an invasive species natural experiment,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069619300142,14 May 2019,2019,Research Article,302.0

However, when manufacturing facilities choose to produce their own electricity, this waste heat is captured by Combined Heating and Power (CHP) technologies and used in the production process. As a result, manufacturers' pollution footprint can be dramatically reduced by choosing to produce electricity onsite rather than purchasing it from a utility. This paper uses Census microdata to study manufacturers’ decision to produce electricity onsite and examines how plants adjust onsite generation when they are subject to environmental regulations. Environmental regulations will backfire if they cause manufacturers to produce less electricity onsite and shift to electricity from less efficient, offsite electric utilities. We find that manufacturing plants subject to NOx command-and-control regulations decrease onsite electricity generation, increase electricity purchases from off-site utilities and see declines in their energy efficiency. However, manufacturers subject to cap-and-trade see no decline in onsite generation and experience improvements in energy efficiency.

This is done by means of a cross-country multi-sectoral dataset. The results show that both rising energy prices and shadow prices of energy have no significant effect on net employment when the manufacturing sectors only are analyzed. While finding significant variations across countries, the average employment effects become significantly positive once jobs in the economy as a whole are considered. This change is driven mainly by larger positive cost effects, which more than offset the negative demand effects and reductions in the positive factor-shift effects. Moreover, the paper reveals that the often implemented approach of using a simple regulation regressor, instead of decomposing the employment effect, can result in biased estimates.","While stricter environmental regulations have been present in the developed world for more than half a century (Sanderson, 1961), more recently, concerns about man-made global warming have revitalized and partly shifted the focus to energy and climate policies (Jacobsson and Lauber, 2006; Rogelj et al., 2016). Apart from their environmental impacts, the potential adverse effects on firm and industry competitiveness have been debated rather diversely by both researchers and policymakers. Especially the “jobs vs. the environment” trade-off (Morgenstern et al., 2002) is a core element in the discussions.==== Yet, even though many fear that jobs in pollution-intensive industries could be lost through more stringent regulations, others argue that the policies may in fact bolster the economy by creating employment in green sectors.====This paper analyzes how changes in regulatory stringency affect the overall employment, and demonstrates that it is important to decompose the labor market consequences. In the context of the environmental regulation-employment nexus, the theoretical model of Berman and Bui (2001) has been commonly referred to by researchers (Cole and Elliott, 2007; Ferris et al., 2014; Gray and Shadbegian, 2013). Closely related to this formal derivation, Morgenstern et al. (2002) outlined three channels through which the demand for labor may be affected by more stringent environmental regulations. First, higher compliance costs are expected to raise the marginal costs of production, leading to increases in output prices and, hence, decreases in the quantity of output demanded. This so-called demand effect reduces the demand for labor. Second, given the increased production costs from additional pollution abatement activities, more inputs, such as labor, are necessary to produce the same amount of output. This is referred to as the cost effect. Third, the factor-shift effect captures the fact that post-regulation technologies and reorganized production processes may require either more or less labor.====When examining this theoretical model empirically, Berman and Bui (2001) noted that one would ideally also try to determine the individual channels of the regulatory effect. However, due to data restrictions, they were not able to estimate the channels separately, e.g. through interaction terms, but instead included only simple environmental policy measures. This approach has been adopted by a considerable number of later studies, including Cole and Elliott (2007), Gray et al. (2014), and Liu et al. (2017).==== Yet, as a simple regulation regressor cannot fully capture the outlined theoretical framework, incorrect magnitudes of the effect on employment may have been estimated. Accordingly, the overall regulatory effect may have been either over- or underestimated given the partly opposing directions of the three effects.====This paper contributes to the empirical literature in two main ways. First and foremost, it addresses the potential estimation bias by decomposing the regulatory effect into the demand, cost, and factor-shift effects using interaction terms in a three-input model. The decomposition may help to refine the estimation of the overall net employment effect and to highlight differences in the importance of individual channels for the employment effect across sectors. By so doing, the focus lies on the energy price-employment relationship utilizing energy prices and shadow prices of emission-relevant energy as measures of regulatory stringency. Moreover, the results are compared to those of the classic approach by including a simple regulation regressor in order to identify variations in the estimated employment effects. Second, the paper adds cross-country evidence on how heterogeneous policy mixes influence the labor demand in the whole economy, thereby highlighting spillovers between sectors. Data on 33 primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors in 27 OECD countries is analyzed for the period 1996 to 2009. Apart from two studies on the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (Chan et al., 2013; Marin et al., 2018), the existing research is based solely on within-country or -subnational differences in regulatory stringency (Cole and Elliott, 2007; Dechezleprêtre and Sato, 2017). Prior studies also tended to look exclusively at manufacturing sectors or a small number of sectors and were therefore unable to estimate the overall net employment effect (Gray and Shadbegian, 2013; Yamazaki, 2017). For example, while stricter energy regulation may cause job losses in energy-intensive manufacturing sectors, jobs in the service sectors may be created through the provision of maintenance support for new machinery and energy consulting services. These sectoral spillovers have not yet been addressed directly in prior regression analyses on the whole economy (Deschênes, 2011; Yamazaki, 2017). In order to identify them and to estimate the overall employment effect, different sector sub-samples are analyzed. Thus, the paper complements the research on regulation-induced changes in industrial composition. Previous work has studied issues such as within-country industry relocations (Kahn and Mansur, 2013), pollution offshoring (Levinson, 2010), transitional costs (Walker, 2013), and skill-biased employment dynamics (Vona et al., 2018).====The present paper finds that both rising energy prices and shadow prices of energy have a positive net effect on employment. In general, a one percent increase in energy prices and shadow prices of energy entails a 0.32 and 0.21 percent increase in employment respectively. Thereby, the total elasticity estimates vary significantly across countries, ranging between −0.17 for Mexico and 0.64 for Sweden. Concerning sectoral differences, the employment effects are insignificant when manufacturing sectors are only analyzed. However, the effects become significantly positive and rise in magnitude once employment in the service and agricultural sectors is also considered. Interestingly, this change is driven mainly by increases in the positive cost effect. At the same time, the positive factor shift effect that is attributed to regulation-induced changes in capital becomes less responsible for job creation. The positive employment effects are reduced by the negative demand effect that remains relatively stable when employment outside the manufacturing sector is also taken into account. Moreover, by comparing the results to those using a simple regulation regressor, the paper finds evidence of an estimation bias. For the analyzed dataset, the classic approach tends to overestimate the net employment effect in the manufacturing sectors and underestimate the effect once all sectors are considered.====The paper continues as follows: Section 2 surveys the empirical literature. In section 3 the key variables, empirical models, dataset used, and descriptive statistics are elaborated successively. The results of both the classic and the augmented model are presented in Section 4. This section also provides robustness checks, country-specific elasticities, and a comparison with the previous literature. Lastly, Section 5 concludes.",Do energy prices affect employment?

Not only due to its increasingly negative effects on current ecological and economic systems, but also due to the uncertainty that surrounds the causes as well as future effects of global warming (Mitchell, 2003; Libecap, 2014). The air pollution levels have been exponentially increasing and current emissions of anthropogenic greenhouse gases are 70% more than they were 40 years ago (Barrett et al., 2014).====Taking into account the trans-boundary nature of air pollution, global collective action is needed to target such a global problem (Feeny et al., 1990; Arce M. and Sandler, 2001; Aakvik and Tjøtta, 2011; Wiener, 2007; Livermore and Revesz, 2017). Therefore, it comes as no surprise that ever since the late 1970's the number of international agreements signed and policies set trying to reduce air pollution has been exponentially increasing. One of the most prominent treaties is the Kyoto protocol (referred to as KP or the protocol thenceforth), which is a part of the United Nations' Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) (Barrett, 1994; Mickwitz, 2003; Mitchell, 2003; Faure and Lefevere, 2012; Vollenweider, 2013).====The KP has legally binding targets that require the industrialized countries to reduce their emissions to be on average 5.2% less than their emission levels in the base year 1990 during the first commitment period (United Nations, 1998; Breidenich et al., 1997; Aldy and Stavins, 2013). One of the important features of the protocol is its international approach. With more than 190 countries, the KP was truly seeking collective action. To facilitate cooperation among the countries, the protocol offered mechanisms such as the International Emission trading (IET), the Joint Implementation (JI) and Clean Development Mechanisms (CDM) through which the countries can achieve their targets jointly or separately (Böhringer, 2003; Aldy and Stavins, 2008; Faure and Lefevere, 2012). This international approach is very important when it comes to the analysis of its effectiveness.====Previous literature has analyzed the effectiveness of the KP in reducing harmful emissions using different empirical methods and has provided conflicting results. On the one hand, (Aichele and Felbermayr, 2013; Grunewald and Martinez-Zarzoso, 2016) show evidence that the ratification of the protocol had an effect on the reduction of the emissions. On the other hand (Almer and Winkler, 2017) show that the protocol had non significant emission reduction in the parties included. While these contributions have their merits empirically, the methods are not without shortcomings when it comes to the analysis of the protocol considering the nature of air pollution and the protocol.====Given the specificities of air pollution -that air is transboundary- as well as the nature of international agreements and the rules and obligations associated with it, the current empirical evidence does not sufficiently address the effectiveness of the protocol. The analysis of the emissions levels of those countries has to take into consideration the selection bias that arises form the voluntary nature of the protocol as well as the collective aspect of the agreement. Hence the need for adequate evaluation of the protocol has become essential, especially with the increased number of agreements being signed and ratified (Barrett, 1994; Mickwitz, 2003; Vollenweider, 2013; Livermore and Revesz, 2017).====The purpose of this paper is to add to the existing empirical literature on the effectiveness of the KP, by using a newly introduced method - the generalized synthetic control method (GSCM)- introduced by Xu (2017). The GSCM facilitates the analysis of the protocol's effectiveness and accounts for the selection bias as well as the collective nature of international agreements, while at the same time overcoming the shortcomings of the methods previously used. In essence, the use of GSCM facilitates a robust comparison between treated and control countries as done by Almer and Winkler (2017) and account for the multiple treated units as done by Grunewald and Martinez-Zarzoso (2016), so as to capture the collective nature of the protocol.====Analyzing data on the GHG emissions using the GSCM, results show that the KP has been successful in reducing the emissions of the countries that were legally bound by the protocol by approximately at least 6% below their expected business-as-usual (BAU) levels. The results are more in line with (Aichele and Felbermayr, 2013; Grunewald and Martinez-Zarzoso, 2016) rather than the results shown by Almer and Winkler (2017). To ensure robustness, several checks were run to check whether the criticism against the protocol was in place or not, and the results show that overall the KP has consistently led to a significant reduction in the GHG emissions of the legally bound parties.====The contribution of this paper is twofolds. It introduces the usage of the GSCM for the first time to analyze the effectiveness of international agreements; in general such analysis has been subject to problems such as endogeneity and Xu (2017) provides a method -GSCM- that facilitates such an analysis. In addition it contributes to the existing literature on the effectiveness of the KP as a collective action by proposing that the protocol's effectiveness is more fairly assessed when dealing with participating countries as a group rather than as individual units, given the transboundary nature of air pollution as well as the collaborative nature of the protocol. Additionally, the papers shed some light on some of the specifications of the Kyoto protocol that were subject to criticism such as “Hot-air”==== and leakage and whether such criticism was in place or not.====The paper is divided into five sections. The following section gives a brief background on the KP as well as previously used methods of analysis. The third section discusses the empirical strategy and the specifications of the GSCM.

Another critical targets of the 13th FYP for Rural Bioenergy Development is to increase the income of rural residents and improve the living conditions of rural households by promoting the utilization of agricultural waste. Moreover, the Announcement on Accelerating Construction of Energy Projects in Impoverished Areas for Promoting Poverty Alleviation, published by the National Energy Administration (NEA) in 2017, emphasizes the contribution of renewable energy to poverty reduction.====Can renewable energy really play a key role in reducing the rural poverty? To explore the question, we investigate the previous Chinese experiences with clean development mechanism (CDM) projects and examine their impacts on poverty reduction. The CDM, which is a part of the flexible mechanisms defined in the Kyoto Protocol, has led to numerous possibilities to absorb foreign investment and enhance sustainable development (SD) in developing countries. According to the definition by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the SD benefits of CDM projects can be divided into three categories: social benefits, economic benefits, and environmental benefits. Examples of these benefits include social benefits such as poverty alleviation, employment generation and enhanced education services; economic benefits such as new industrial activities, productivity growth, and technology innovation; and environmental benefits such as improvement of air, water, and land quality.====Many existing studies have examined the extent to which the CDM can achieve its SD goals. Studies with positive findings suggest that the CDM contributes to SD in host countries in different ways. In particular, small-scale rural renewable energy projects, seem to offer the best prospects for poverty alleviation under the CDM (Brunt and Knechtel, 2005; Newell et al., 2011). However, when considering SD benefits, Olsen and Fenhann (2008) conclude that on the basis of a text analysis of 744 project design documents (PDDs), the project type is more significant than the differences between small- and large-scale projects. Wood (2011) confirms that the CDM projects that involve energy efficient or renewable energy-based cook stoves create substantial benefits for the poor, mainly by significantly improving the air quality within their houses and reducing household expenditure on fuel. Wang et al. (2013) evaluate the employment impacts through an input-output approach. Their results show that solar projects have the greatest potential for indirect job creation, whereas hydro projects induce job losses. By contrast, Mori-Clement (2019) examines impacts of CDM projects on SD in Brazilian municipalities, revealing that only hydro projects have contributed to long-term poverty reduction. Weitzel et al. (2015) maintain that larger CDM projects and more advanced technologies are more likely to involve technology transfer. The impact of CDM projects on technology transfer has been also studied by many researchers (Seres et al., 2009; Wang, 2010; Zhang and Yan, 2015; Tang and Popp, 2016; Huenteler et al., 2018; and Hayashi et al., 2018). Particularly, Tang and Popp (2016) observe that a project developer's experience and the joint learning within partnerships lead to the largest cost reductions and capacity factor improvement in CDM projects in China.====However, some researchers have suggested neutral or even negative SD impacts. For example, Zhang and Wang (2011) employ an econometric approach to estimate the CDM effect on reducing local air pollution in China and conclude that the CDM does not have a statistically significant effect in lowering SO==== emissions. On the other hand, by examining a sample of working CDM projects in South Africa, Pillay (2015) concludes that the contribution of CDM to sustainable development is heavily skewed toward greenhouse gas reduction, with little priority given to health, education, and employment generation. Results from other studies have also suggested that the CDM projects do not contribute to poverty reduction and employment generation. Sirohi (2007) indicates that the socio-economic development potential of CDM projects in India is ambiguous and suggests that for CDM to emerge as a “win-win” poverty alleviation strategy, its projects should be implemented at the rural community level. Sutter and Parreno (2007), after assessing 16 officially registered CDM projects, conclude that less than 1% of the CDM projects are likely to contribute significantly to SD in the host country. Subbarao and Lloyd (2011) examine 500 registered small-scale CDM projects in the fields of employment, migration, access to electricity, health, the use of local resources, local environment and stakeholder perception. They reveal that CDM projects have generated a modest impact on employment generation for the local community. Crowe (2013) examines 114 CDM projects for pro-poor benefits and the results indicate that nearly 74% of projects are categorized as delivering no pro-poor benefits at the local community level. Dirix et al. (2016) review empirical studies on the pro-poor benefits of the CDM to host country communities, concluding that the CDM has failed to deliver poverty alleviation. By assessing the ex-post quantitative effect that CDM projects have had on SD in Peru, Pécastaing et al. (2018) suggest that CDM investments had a slight effect on household consumption expenditure and had no effect on employment or in poverty alleviation.====In summary, previous studies have shown inconclusive results on whether CDM activities truly contribute to the SD in host countries. In this study, we aim to evaluate the social benefits of the CDM on rural communities of the host country. We particularly focus on income growth, the creation of job opportunities, and changes in the industrial structure as indicators of social benefits. Based on the PDD evaluations submitted in the context of the CDM, the UNFCCC has concluded that the most prominent benefits claimed by project developers are the stimulation of the local economy through employment creation and poverty alleviation (Dirix et al., 2016). Moreover, the eradication of poverty is also regarded as an indispensable requirement for SD (United Nations, 2012).====The contributions of this study can be summarized as follows: Currently, there are two primary approaches to study the SD benefits of CDM: (1) input-output methods or computable general equilibrium model (Wang et al., 2013; Timilsina and Shrestha, 2006); and (2) analytical methods, which generally rely on extensive surveys or PDDs of the projects (Olsen and Fenhann, 2008; Subbarao and Lloyd, 2011; and Crowe, 2013). Although Pécastaing et al. (2018) and Mori-Clement (2019) have used difference-in-differences (DID) methodology to study SD benefits of CDM projects in Peru and Brazil, respectively, their studies are limited in terms of the type and number of projects involved, and length of study period investigated. To fill this research gap, we used a fixed effects DID model in conjunction with the propensity score matching (PSM), to investigate the social benefits of RE-CDM projects in rural communities of China. China has been the largest host country for CDM projects and offers the best environment to study the impact of various types of renewable energy-based projects.====We also contribute to the literature by performing a rigorous robustness check of estimation results. In our context, selection bias matters if the siting of CDM projects is based on the expected growth in the hosting counties. To confirm whether this is the case, we implement a balancing test on differences in the baseline characteristics between treatment and control before and after matching. We also estimate the main models with interactions between baseline characteristics and year dummy as a robustness check to account for growth trends. Furthermore, we check the robustness of our estimation results, obtained through the PSM-DID approach by adopting the Mahalanobis distance matching (MDM) method. In addition, we investigate the impact of conventional thermal power projects on income and employment to compare with our main results.====Another contribution of this study is that our findings provide policy implications on the possibility of simultaneously achieving the goal of climate change mitigation and poverty alleviation. It is imperative that countries achieve their targets of poverty reduction under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),==== while meeting their commitments to greenhouse gas emission reductions under the Paris Agreement.==== Thus, our study relates to the literature on poverty reduction and the environmental protection. By using satellite-based estimates of forest cover, Sims (2010) finds that protected areas increased average consumption and lowered poverty rates in Thailand. On the other hand, Sims and Alix-Garcia (2017) estimate the impacts of protected areas and payment for ecosystem services and confirm that the former had neutral impacts on livelihoods, while the latter led to small poverty alleviation. Meeks et al. (2017) estimate the environmental and socio-economic impacts of biogas adoption by households in Nepal. Their results suggest that biogas adoption reduces forest cover loss as well as the amount of fuelwood collected and purchased.==== We complement these studies by focusing on the renewable energy projects that require substantial investment and labor force thereby leading to significant impact on rural development.====The main result of this study is that the RE-CDM contributes significantly to poverty alleviation. Our findings suggest that biomass-based CDM projects can bring about income growth and job creation in rural communities in China. For example, implementing the biomass-based CDM projects increases the annual income of rural residents by 5.75%. Moreover, we find that wind energy projects can help to increase incomes and the share of workers in the primary sector in rural communities. These findings imply that investment in climate change mitigation can play a simultaneous role in poverty alleviation.====This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the current status of income inequality and the promotion of the renewable energy in China. Section 3 describes the data for estimation and the measures of social benefits. Section 4 follows with an analysis framework, including a description of the empirical model and matching techniques. Estimation results and discussions are provided in Section 5.

Renewable energy competes with food production for land and the food productivity of land can be improved at some cost. To avoid catastrophic climate damages, the pollution stock is mandated to stay below a given cap. When the economy is not constrained by the cap, the efficiency of energy transformation increases steadily until the transition toward the ultimate green economy; when renewable energy is exploited, its land use rises at the expense of food production; food productivity increases together with the land rent but food production drops; the food and energy prices increase and renewables substitute for non-renewable energy. During the constrained phase, the economy follows a constant path of prices, quantities, efficiency rates, food productivity and land rent, a phenomenon we call the ‘ceiling efficiency paradox’.","The transition toward a green economy requires significant improvements of the conversion rates of primary energies into useful energy, what Fouquet (2008) calls ‘energy services’, and a progressive substitution of carbon free energy sources for polluting fossil fuels. Developing the use of green energy implies also a competition for the land uses. The deployment of green energy consists in allocating a larger part of the solar radiation to the production of useful energy and a smaller part to the production of food because for capturing the solar primary resource, in most cases, land is needed.==== Furthermore, given that the atmospheric pollution stock must be kept under some ceiling to avoid catastrophic damages, the urgency of the substitution and/or the conversion rate improvements to carry out evolves through time.====In this paper we characterize the optimal dynamics of energy efficiency, the renewable/nonrenewable energy mix and the allocation of land when carbon concentrations are not allowed to exceed a catastrophe threshold. We show that along the optimal paths, all the substitutions and conversion rate improvements must be stopped within the phase during which the maximum pollution stock constraint is binding. The efforts must be made before the arrival at the ceiling, to delay the arrival time of the constraint while beginning the transition, and after the phase at the ceiling to complete the transition.","Competing land uses and fossil fuel, and optimal energy conversion rates during the transition toward a green economy under a pollution stock constraint",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069616303266,25 March 2019,2019,Research Article,307.0

The value of changes in natural capital ,"Change in wealth, measured by aggregating over a broad set of capital asset stocks (including reproducible, natural, and human capital) at their appropriate accounting prices, is a leading sustainability indicator (Arrow et al., 2004; Dasgupta, 2007; Matson et al., 2016; UNU-IHDP and UNEP, 2014).==== The aggregation of manufactured, reproducible, and financial capital assets can often occur independent of their spatial distribution. These forms of capital obey the “law of one price” because their arbitrage carries low transaction and transportation costs. Therefore, spatial context has negligible impact on the definition of the stock or the accounting price since the assets can be freely moved to locations where they obtain their highest values.====For example, the appropriate accounting price for sewing machines in the US is not strongly impacted by the location of the machines. Relatively low transaction costs and the existence of well-defined property rights and markets imply that sewing machines are allocated to locations holding the highest marginal value for them. For some forms of reproducible capital, however, like roads or bridges, the marginal value can depend on spatial context and potentially vary by aggregation scale or method. Unlike a sewing machine, roads and bridges are not easily reallocated.====As with bridges, location matters for the value of natural capital; spatial context may, in part, define the resource stock. While there are some forms of natural capital for which location is less relevant – for instance, the carbon sink capacity of the ocean – many forms of natural capital are difficult to relocate making their location important to their value. Aggregation of the value of natural capital must reflect the weak and costly arbitrage opportunities for these assets. Weak arbitrage opportunities imply that neighboring stocks are poor substitutes for local stocks, a property that accounting prices can reflect (Yun et al., 2017). Accounting prices can diverge spatially when the costs of transporting the asset exceed the marginal value at the new location. This can lead to the marginal future value of the resource being locally positive, but zero elsewhere.====Spatial aggregation of natural capital values is a crucial issue, but has been neglected as a primary focus in practice for two reasons (Whittington and Macrae, 1986). First, valuing natural capital has been closely associated with national wealth accounting, where national aggregates are desired (UNU-IHDP and UNEP, 2014; World Bank, 2011; Hanley et al., 2015; Hamilton and Ruta, 2009; Arrow et al., 2012) over subnational values. There are, however, a few important exceptions that focus on regional applications or micro level data (Yun et al., 2017; Dovern et al., 2014; Pearson et al., 2013). Second, the literature has focused on devising credible natural capital asset values under the guiding principle that well-estimated, local, per-unit values could be applied across locations with similar characteristics through benefits transfer (Boyle et al., 2010). However, the benefits transfer literature cautions that this method may be inappropriate where characteristics vary across space (Loomis, 1992; Smith, 1992). The same caution applied to benefits transfer also applies to transferring values for wealth accounting and natural capital accounting prices.====Valuation of natural capital must occur at the scale of the relevant economic jurisdiction, or range over which the stock can be exchanged for use (Loomis, 2000; Smith, 1993). Relative scarcity, the availability of substitutes, and the costs of, or opportunities for, arbitrage are a few characteristics that may vary across space and have the potential to drive a wedge between the sum of the aggregated parts and the value of the whole for natural capital assets and the services they provide.====Aggregation bias is the difference between the estimated capital asset value or accounting price and the true value due solely to the scale at which individual characteristics or values are aggregated (Blundell and Stoker, 2005). One method to purge estimates of aggregation bias is to manipulate the spatial unit of analysis such that the aggregated estimates at successively fine scales are unchanged. However, in practice, data on natural capital asset characteristics and values are infrequently rich enough to do this.====Concerns about spatial aggregation go beyond implementation of wealth accounting. Assumptions about spatial aggregation may be culpable for the spread of values found in the literature for similar resources (Blundell and Stoker, 2005; Guerry et al., 2015). The treatment of relative local scarcity may be as important in natural capital valuation as refinements to methodology. As natural capital asset valuation methods mature, a key empirical question is the magnitude of the errors incurred by aggregation across spatial heterogeneity in resource characteristics.====We contribute to the literature by analyzing the role of spatial aggregation in the Fenichel and Abbott (2014) framework for measuring the value of natural capital. We use theory to show that when natural capital is aggregated the asset price curves can become more inelastic with respect to stock. Considering asset price as a function of stock, this means the price curves are flatter when taken over larger spatial areas. We also show that current methods for measuring natural capital asset prices may be biased for two reasons: 1) Failure to account for spatial heterogeneity of institutions in parameter estimation and forecasting (omitted variables bias), and 2) Improperly aggregating across overlapping distributions of resource characteristics (aggregation bias). These two effects may lead researchers to underestimate accounting prices for particularly rare resources or overestimate accounting prices for plentiful assets. We quantify the magnitude of the aggregation error in an empirical study comparing accounting prices for groundwater in the Kansas High Plains Aquifer (KHPA) estimated at the aggregate state-wide level with accounting prices estimated at the groundwater management district (GMD) level (Fig. 1).",Spatial aggregation and the value of natural capital,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069618302468,May 2019,2019,Research Article,308.0

Using a near-universal birth record of NYC and surrounding counties over 2004–2015 and employing both the synthetic control method and a difference-in-differences model, we find that an approximately 20% increase in urban forest cover decreased prematurity and low birth weight among mothers in NYC by 2.1 and 0.24 percentage points, respectively, relative to similar mothers outside of NYC. The low birth weight finding is equivalent to getting a mother smoking two cigarettes a day during pregnancy to quit. An internal validity test suggests that changes in the composition of NYC mothers cannot explain the observed effects. Additionally, we find evidence that declines in PM==== concentrations and increases in outdoor walks are potential causal mechanisms. Results suggest that urban afforestation may be able to complement existing policies aimed at improving infant health.","Forests and trees provide beneficial ecosystem services. For example, trees remove pollutants from the air. It is estimated that urban trees in the US reduce air pollution by more than 711,000 metric tons per year, valued at $3.8 billion in avoided damages (Nowak et al., 2006). Trees also lower ambient outside temperatures and create shade, acting like natural cooling mechanisms, reducing the urban “heat island effect” and decreasing summertime electricity use by 1.5–5.2% (Donovan and Butry, 2009). Trees are also an important source of recreation value and can stimulate people to be physically active. Correlational evidence suggests that people living in areas with more greenspace and tree cover tend to be more active outdoors (Hansmann et al., 2007) and exercise more (Coombes et al., 2010). Property values are also higher in urban areas with nearby trees (Sander et al., 2010). However, despite an extensive literature on the many benefits of tree cover, their human health externalities are largely unknown, particularly the empirical health benefits of afforestation.====The existing literature on trees and human health, nascent as it is, has tended to study correlations between proximal forest canopy, greenspace, and health outcomes (e.g., Dadvand et al., 2014; Lovasi et al., 2013; Donovan et al., 2011), or has exploited instances of forest destruction to study the tree-human health relationship (e.g., Berazneva and Byker, 2017; Jones and McDermott, 2018; Garg, 2016). Less understood are the health impacts of afforestation, particularly in urban areas where more than half the world's population resides. This is problematic for at least two reasons. First, many urban areas, predominantly in developed countries, are implementing significant afforestation programs to plant millions of new trees, costing hundreds of millions of (largely taxpayer) dollars (e.g., New York City, Los Angeles, Denver, London, Copenhagen, Auckland). Part of the impetus for such programs are the supposed health impacts that greater urban forest cover provides through reduced air pollution and enhanced outdoor recreation opportunities, among other things. For example, a US Forest Service report on the 2007 Los Angeles afforestation program states that “expanding the urban forest is … integral to enhancing public health programs” and that “the presence of trees in cities provides public health benefits and improves the well-being of those who live, work, and play in cities” (McPherson et al., 2008, pgs. 1 & 41). Similarly, the 2007 New York City afforestation program contained a “Trees for Public Health” component that focused on planting new trees in neighborhoods with high asthma hospitalization rates for children (Campbell et al., 2014). Despite such well-meaning statements and initiatives, there is a lack of credible evidence that planting urban trees do meaningfully improve health, precluding rigorous assessments of many of the public health claims being made. Second, there is a growing body of literature finding that infant and prenatal health is particularly sensitive to changes in environmental quality (e.g., Knittel et al., 2016; Currie and Walker, 2011; Currie, 2009 and see Graff Zivin and Neidell, 2013 for more detail), which in turn impacts human capital outcomes, long-term earnings potential, and health later in life (Isen et al., 2017; Currie et al., 2014). If urban afforestation (an improvement to environmental quality) has a meaningful effect on infant health, then investments in tree cover could generate positive, long-term spillover effects on schooling attainment, test scores, use of disability programs, and wages. Thus, in this regard, investigating afforestation health externalities has the potential to be highly impactful.====In this paper, we study the infant health externalities of urban afforestation by exploiting a quasi-experiment provided by the MillionTreesNYC program in New York City (NYC) where one-million new trees were added to the urban forest canopy from 2007 to 2015. Costing at least $400 million (Oldfield et al., 2013), MillionTreesNYC increased the NYC forest canopy by approximately 20%. We study the effect of the MillionTreesNYC program, and thus sharp increases in urban environmental quality, on the health of infants born to mothers living in NYC relative to similar mothers living in the areas surrounding NYC, but where no large-scale afforestation program occurred over the same period. A rich, restricted use US CDC National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) dataset containing millions of individual birth observations in NYC and the surrounding counties is used in the analysis.====To isolate the infant health impacts of MillionTreesNYC from other concurrent amenity, transportation, and environmental changes in NYC, this work makes several methodological advancements for dealing with endogeneity and simultaneity concerns in the context of studying environmentally-driven changes in urban health. First, we construct a unique dataset of infant health outcomes, air pollution, weather, sociodemographics, transportation habits (e.g., bicycles, personal vehicles, buses), and time use from multiple data sources. We then systematically investigate each source as either a potential causal mechanism or confounder of the results. Second, we carefully exploit the biological timing of the deciduous tree abscission process (i.e., the process by which trees shed their leaves in autumn and gain them back in the spring) to show heterogeneous infant health impacts of urban afforestation during the winter months by using a triple difference model and monthly data. Lastly, to develop a credible counterfactual of infant outcomes in the absence of the afforestation program, we employ both the synthetic control method of Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003) using county-level averaged data in addition to a more traditional difference-in-differences model that uses individual birth observations. Use of both methods represents a methodological contribution given the relative rarity of the synthetic control method in contemporary environmental health applications.====Four conclusions arise. First, using the synthetic control method we find that prematurity and low birth weight among mothers in NYC fell by 2.1 and 0.24 percentage points, respectively, in the aftermath of the afforestation program. The low birth weight effect is equivalent to getting a mother smoking two cigarettes a day during pregnancy to quit (Currie et al., 2009). This result is robust to several alternative specifications of the model and constructions of the counterfactual. Second, we find no significant effects of the MillionTreesNYC program on the demographic characteristics of mothers in NYC. This suggests that the estimated infant health effects are not due to changes in the composition of NYC mothers. Third, improvements in prematurity and low birth weight are larger among African American mothers relative to other races. Since African American mothers are more likely than other groups to have low birth weight and/or premature babies (Meyer et al., 2010), this result suggests that afforestation may have broader racial health disparity consequences. Finally, we show that decreases in PM==== pollution concentrations and increases in outdoor walks in NYC after the afforestation program may be potential causal mechanisms for the infant health effects observed.",Urban afforestation and infant health: Evidence from MillionTreesNYC,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069618306107,May 2019,2019,Research Article,309.0

It has been claimed that large monuments harm local economies by restricting growth of the grazing, timber, mining, and energy industries. Others have asserted that large monuments aid economic growth by reducing reliance on volatile commodity markets and fostering tourism growth. In this study, we use a synthetic control approach to measure the average causal effect of nine national monument designations on county-level per capita income. We find no evidence that monument designation affected per capita income in any of 20 counties hosting nine large (>50,000 acres) national monuments established under the Antiquities Act (six monuments) or by legislative action (three monuments). The broad economic claims of both advocates and critics of large national monuments have little empirical support. The absence of a designation effect for large national monuments is likely due to the attributes of federal land and the legal constraints under which it is managed.","Between 1996 and 2016, Presidents Clinton and Obama used the Antiquities Act to establish 22 landscape-scale National Monuments (NMs) on more than 11.5 million acres of federally-owned land. Located primarily in western states, landscape-scale NMs are defined as roughly greater than 100,000 acres. The Presidential proclamation for each new monument unequivocally stated that it would be “subject to existing valid uses” of federal land and, as such, was crafted to minimize disruption to ongoing economic activities that remain compatible with protection of the historic and scientific objects contained within the monument. However, numerous industry groups and elected officials often denounced a new monument as imposing regional economic hardship. Large national monuments are alleged to curtail grazing, mining, logging, and energy activities, thus diminishing economic development alternatives or even causing regional economic ruin. In contrast, others claim these same national monuments will support a growing tourism sector, accelerate economic growth, and free local economies from dependency on volatile commodities markets. Clearly, both claims cannot hold true for the same national monument.====Despite two decades of heated political rhetoric about the broader economic effects of large national monuments, a survey of the peer-reviewed literature yields only one study that has studied the aggregate economic effects of such monuments. Jakus and Akhundjanov (2018) recently found that the time paths of per capita income in the two counties that host the Grand Staircase-Escalante NM—established in 1996—had not changed as the result of monument designation. The authors concluded that any economic harm to one set of industries caused by monument designation had been offset by growth in another industry group. No other study has isolated the aggregate economic effect of large national monuments. Instead, most studies have lumped national monuments into a protected land category that includes national parks, wilderness areas, national recreation areas and other land classifications (Lewis et al., 2003; Rasker et al., 2013). However, visitation at national parks has long been supported by public and private promotional campaigns and is known to be a strong regional economic driver (Wilkerson, 2003; Gabe, 2016). One cannot conclude that national monuments—whose management is not driven by tourism—will provide a positive aggregate economic effect similar to national parks. National monuments can be very large relative to national parks: for example, in 2017 each of Utah's two largest monuments was larger than the combined acreage of the state's five national parks. The local footprint of a large national monument, with its relative lack of tourism and attendant restrictions on land use and access, means a monument could have, as many have asserted, a negative effect on local economic well-being.====The results presented by Jakus and Akhundjanov (2018) do not support such an argument, but their research was limited to only Grand Staircase-Escalante NM, which might raise concerns about external validity. The present study examines whether their result is more general by rigorously establishing the direction and magnitude of the average causal effect of similarly large monuments established between 1982 and 2001. Six of our study monuments were established by Antiquities Act proclamations, whereas the remaining three were created by legislative acts of Congress. All of our study monuments have been in place for more than a decade and any positive or negative effect on the regional economy should be measurable today. We begin by presenting a brief history of the controversial Antiquities Act, as well as its use in recent decades. After an explanation of our statistical approach, we report the effect of large national monuments on county-level per capita income. We detect no statistically significant effect of monument designation on the time path of per capita income in any of the 20 counties studied. We discuss the nature of federal land and its management, and physical and legal constraints to explain the absence of a designation effect.","The Antiquities Act, national monuments, and the regional economy",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069618305849,May 2019,2019,Research Article,310.0

The correctly calculated standard error for WTP using this approach is shown to be undefined. This occurs because the cost parameter's standard error implies some possibility the true parameter value is arbitrarily close to zero. We propose a simple yet elegant way to overcome this problem by reparameterizing the (negative) cost variable's coefficient using an exponential transformation to enforce the theoretically correct positive coefficient. With it the confidence interval for WTP is now finite and well behaved.,"Use of the ratio of an utility function attribute parameter to a cost parameter to measure willingness to pay (WTP) for the attribute in a discrete choice model is a long-standing widely-used practice in applied economics (Hensher et al., 2015). However, as a researcher usually deals with maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of the utility function parameters, there is uncertainty associated with them. Taking this uncertainty into account in numerical approximation of the standard error associated with WTP generally requires the assumption that the ML estimates of the utility function parameters have an asymptotically normal distribution, with means equal to their ML estimates and standard deviations equal to their standard errors (Bockstael and Strand, 1987). Calculating moments of a resulting ==== (e.g., the empirical distribution of WTP) becomes problematic.====Non-existence of moments of a ratio distribution resulting from dividing two normally distributed variables has long been known in statistics. It confronts all ratio estimates that exhibit Cauchy-like tail behavior where that occurs because the distribution of the denominator spans zero (Lehmann and Shaffer, 1988).==== As a result, the mean and standard deviation of the resulting WTP ratio distribution are undefined, and the resulting distribution is not normal, being typically skewed and potentially bimodal. The ratio formed by the point estimate of the coefficients is also different from the median of the ratio distribution. The usual implementations of the delta and KR approaches to obtaining confidence intervals help to mask the nature of the problem. This problem applies to the estimated standard error of WTP in all commonly used discrete choice logit and probit models with non-random monetary parameter (e.g., multinomial logit (MNL), nested logit, latent class logit, or some mixed logit (MXL) specifications).====We propose a new specification for selected parameters in discrete choice models, which allows for the cost parameter to be constrained to strictly negative or positive values only. This alternative specification imposes a standard restriction from neoclassical economic theory and, at the same time, avoids problems associated with non-existent moments of the resulting WTP ratio distribution. Our proposed alternative specification can be easily implemented in available commercial software and used for any discrete choice model with a non-random cost coefficient.",A new baseline model for estimating willingness to pay from discrete choice models,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069618302602,May 2019,2019,Research Article,311.0

Our dataset contains information on 4.8 million houses with at least one repeat-sale. This database is merged with high-definition GIS data delineating the spatial extent of all recorded flood incidents in England covering a total area of 2,654 km","Flood risk is a serious policy issue globally and particularly in the United Kingdom (UK). It is estimated that 2.8 million properties in England alone are exposed to some risk of flooding of which 690 thousand are properties at very significant risk (75-year return period or less). The expected annual damage to residential properties alone amounts to £270 m, although even this considers only the direct damages (Sayers et al., 2015). Projections of future flood risk by Sayers et al. (2015) produced for the UK Climate Change Risk Assessment 2017 suggest that even in a scenario without population growth the number of properties in England exposed to very significant risk would increase by 43–130 percent by 2080. The UK Committee on Climate Change (2015) notes that each year 4600 new homes are built in areas exposed to significant flood risk, and almost 50 percent of these are constructed in areas at very significant risk.====The current prevalence of flooding, with major UK flood events occurring in 1998, 2000, 2007, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, together with continuous development on floodplains and the expected increase in flooding due to climate change means that it is important to understand the implications of flooding for households. Samwinga et al. (2004) and Lamond et al. (2010) state that one of the major concerns of households affected by flooding is the financial impact in terms of the insurability and saleability of their property. Brignall and Jones (2016, ====) document the fear of households that their properties have been permanently blighted and in some cases become virtually unsaleable after the recent floods in the north of England in December 2015.====A significant body of literature now examines the effect of a flood on the price of properties located in floodplains. Importantly however, many of these studies fail to distinguish between properties merely situated in the floodplain and those which were actually ==== resulting in a major problem of interpretation. Furthermore, most of these studies were undertaken in the United States (US). With the exception of Atreya and Ferreira (2015) for the US and Daniel et al. (2009) for the Netherlands there are no other studies into the effect of flooding on the price of ==== properties, something ascribable to missing information regarding those properties that were located within the inundated area.====The purpose of this paper is to analyse the immediate impact on and the subsequent recovery of the price of inundated properties in England using a repeat-sales Hedonic Price Model (HPM). More specifically we analyse the price of property in postcodes that were either partially flooded (where we know the precise extent of flooding) and in postcodes that were entirely flooded. Furthermore unlike Atreya and Ferreira (2015) and Daniel et al. (2009) we explain the heterogeneity of flooding impacts by reference to property characteristics (type and price), flood type (coastal, inland or sewer), duration and frequency, and location characteristics (rural versus urban) and presence of flood defence infrastructure. Our dataset includes information on over 12 million individual property transactions and about 4.8 million houses with at least one repeat-sale during the period of analysis. Central to our work is the use of recently-released high-resolution Geographical Information Systems (GIS) data delineating the area maximally affected by each individual flood event on record in England. This evidence is generally based on aerial photographs taken at ‘peak flooding’. Together, these flood events represent a total flooded area of 2654 km==== during the period 1995–2014.====Apart from being one of only two others to investigate the impact of inundation on property values our paper also makes several further contributions to the literature. We present the first study to use information on all repeat sales within an entire country to measure the impact of all recorded flood events over a 20 year period. All other studies of which we are aware consider the impact of flooding on specific regions or the impact of single flood events which may be atypical. However, our national dataset includes multiple flood events in numerous locations representing the entire ‘population’ of floods. Furthermore, only one other study has used information on ‘actual’ inundation revealed through observation rather than through flood simulation (Daniel et al., 2009). Likewise, only one other paper has examined the impact of flooding on the price of flats (Meldrum, 2015) and only one other paper has used a semi-parametric representation of the recovery in prices post flooding (Atreya et al., 2013).====To anticipate our main findings, in the immediate aftermath of inland flooding the average price of property in a postcode entirely inundated is 24.9% lower. For incidents of coastal flooding the corresponding figure is 21.1%. These results moreover emerge from a comparison of inundated and non-inundated properties all within the floodplain. Such discounts are however short-lived; property affected by inland flooding typically recovers after 5 years and in just 4 years for coastal properties. The time for price recovery differs markedly for properties in different price-quartiles. For properties affected by coastal flooding in the highest price-quartile, the property price discount disappears after only 1 year whereas for properties in the lowest price-quartile the discount remains statistically significant for up to 6–7 years.====The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 presents a review of the literature on the use of the HPM to estimate the effect of flooding on property prices. Section 3 provides the theory underlying HPM applied to flooding and section 4 describes our identification strategy.

The present paper derives discount rates using an augmented measure of national income inclusive of non-market goods. In an empirical application focusing on air pollution and climate damages in the United States economy, the paper reports that the difference between augmented and market discount rates averages 0.3 percentage points from 1999 to 2014.","Most developed economies invest in public goods such as national defense, education, infrastructure, and the environment. Holding total investment fixed, expenditures on public projects entail a diversion of funds away from market consumption or investments in private capital. The appropriate discount rate with which to evaluate public projects must reflect the rate of return on social investment opportunities (Baumol, 1968). Comprehensively evaluating the return to such investments likely requires data that lie beyond the market boundary. For example, private investment that subsequently boosts output is likely to induce non-market external costs such as climate change and local pollution. Additionally, public goods investment may yield non-market returns through ecosystem services, domestic security, and human capital. Measuring only those returns that accrue within the market may produce biased estimates of the yield on investment. This bias would, in turn, manifest in social discount rates. In light of this, the present paper suggests using an augmented measure of income to evaluate both market and non-market returns. This facilitates estimation of an appropriate social discount rate used for Net Present Value (NPV) analysis of public projects.====Economists tend to base estimates of the discount rate used in NPV calculations on interest rates in financial markets, the rate of return on private capital, or the utility-neutral rate of savings (Gollier, 2011). Despite these rather crisp recommendations, estimating social discount rates has long-occupied economists (Steiner, 1959; Marglin, 1963a, 1963b; Baumol, 1968; Bradford, 1975; Mendelsohn, 1981; Weitzman, 1994). Recent debates concerning the economics of climate change centered on the appropriate discount rate (Stern, 2007; Nordhaus, 2007). Even more recently, papers have explored departures from conventional approaches to discounting including declining discount rates (Weitzman, 2001; Cropper et al., 2014), dual discounting for market and environmental goods (Drupp, 2018), and the role of relative prices and substitution between market and environmental goods (Hoel and Sterner, 2007; Traeger, 2011).====The present paper does not propose to settle ongoing discussions regarding the “right” social discount rate. Rather, the paper offers a different perspective on this topic by deriving discount rates for public projects using an augmented measure of national income inclusive of non-market goods. This tack permits expenditure on public goods to both (1) reduce the rate of return on saving by diverting funds away from private capital, and, critically, (2) to affect the level of public goods and services, which then, in turn, permutes augmented output. When calculated in such a framework, discount rates reflect three key factors: the productivity of private capital, the opportunity cost of direct expenditure on public projects, and the returns to public investment that accrete outside of the market boundary. This paper compares this augmented discount rate to market discount rates (the yield on relatively risk-free assets, like U.S. government bonds), showing under what conditions these rates differ and how.====The analytical modeling in this study builds on the approach to distilling discount rates from a National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) framework developed by Weitzman (1994), who explored differences between market rates of discount and rates that reflect the diversion of some investment to pollution abatement expenditure.==== Intuitively, expenditures on maintaining environmental quality necessitated by binding policy constraints effectively ratchet back gains from saving (and, hence, discount rates) because some of the returns from investment in private capital are diverted to abatement. This result is a clear elicitation of the need to employ an augmented measure of output in the presence of external economies; because a market-centered accounting framework does not allow environmental damage to directly affect income, abatement can only adversely affect the return to savings and lower the discount rate. Weitzman's tack assumes that abatement expenditure (investment in public goods) is less productive than investment in private capital simply because the returns to investment manifest outside the scope of income in the NIPAs.==== More broadly, if the output measure does not include the services generated by a public good, then investments made by society in such a good will appear to be unproductive. In marked contrast, the present paper employs an income measure that includes non-market goods. This enables one to more comprehensively calculate the rate of return on investments in both private capital that may generate environmental externality and in public goods such as environmental quality.====Weitzman's model largely subsumed time (Weitzman, 1994). While savings decisions today affected consumption in a future period, the ramifications of savings in the present was ignored, and the responsiveness of environmental damage to abatement and damage were held fixed. This paper allows expenditure on abatement, the responsiveness of environmental damage to abatement, and the damage intensity of output to change over time. Further, this paper explicitly treats time. Abatement (and damage for that matter) inhibit growth in any period: when society saves in (t), it triggers less abatement (and damage), in (t), because current period consumption falls. Of course, the productivity of private capital increases output in period (t + 1) which increases abatement and damage. The time path of ==== abatement and damage are crucial to the augmented discount rate (Hoel and Sterner, 2007; Gollier, 2010). A model that subsumes time and holds damage fixed overlooks this effect.====The paper also empirically estimates damages from air pollution and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the U.S. from 1999 to 2014. (This particular application is chosen because of well-developed empirical models and large damages, Muller, 2014a, 2014b.) Air pollutants included in the empirical analysis are fine particulate matter (PM====), sulfur dioxide (SO====), nitrogen oxides (NO====), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and ammonia (NH====). The air pollution damages are estimated using an integrated assessment model (IAM), the AP3 model that is calibrated to the U.S. economy over this 15-year period. AP3 and its predecessors have been widely applied in peer-reviewed studies (Holland et al., 2015; Muller, 2011, 2014a; 2014b; Muller et al., 2011; NAS NRC, 2010; Michalek et al., 2011; Clay et al., 2018). Additionally, estimates of the marginal damage from carbon dioxide emissions (CO====) are drawn from recent estimates in the literature (IAWG, 2016). The damages for both air pollution and GHGs are computed by first estimating pollutant-and-source-specific marginal damages, and then multiplying these pollution “prices” times reported emission “quantities”. Thus, Gross External Damages (GED), inclusive of both CO==== and air pollution, are computed in a manner that is directly analogous to how market indices such as gross domestic product (GDP) are calculated (Nordhaus, 2006; Muller et al., 2011). Using estimates of damages, reported GDP, and abatement expenditure (USEPA, 2011a), the paper ties the conceptual modeling to the empirical estimates of three discount rates calibrated to the U.S. economy from 1999 to 2014.",The derivation of discount rates with an augmented measure of income,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069618304121,May 2019,2019,Research Article,313.0

The well-known rule for optimal pollution/abatement effort requires marginal abatement cost to align with marginal damage and to equalize across all polluters. The implementation of such an optimal allocation depends on the regulator having sufficient information about both (marginal) damage and polluters' (marginal) abatement cost schedules. While we now have a whole array of valuation methods to determine the external costs of pollution, and hence marginal damage, eliciting the polluters’ private abatement cost seems to be more difficult. Before launching the sulfur dioxide trading program in the USA, the Environmental Protection Agency conducted a survey among the polluters affected to get an idea of the range of abatement costs and to set the emission cap accordingly. Not surprisingly for economists, firms over-reported (or over-estimated) their private costs. Consequently, emission prices were greatly over-estimated (Joskow et al., 1998; Rico, 1995), and the emission cap was set much too high relative to actual abatement costs.====It is well known that a regulator's choice of policy instrument affects firms' incentives to over- or under-report their private abatement costs. Suppose a regulator announces the implementation of an emission tax or the auctioning-off of tradable permits. If marginal damage is increasing and the regulator is expected to follow the Pigouvian optimality rule, then firms will have an incentive to under-report their private abatement costs. If, by contrast, the regulator announces to issue emission permits for free, firms are likely to over-report their costs (Kwerel, 1977; Montero, 2008).====Starting from Groves (1973) and Groves and Ledyard (1977), scholars have developed the theory of incentive compatible mechanisms. A major insight from this theory is that under incomplete information about agents' private preferences or costs, truthful revelation of such preference or cost parameters can be induced by choosing an appropriate scheme for paying/charging incentive payments to/from the agents. If a regulator is not constrained by balanced budget conditions, he or she can even induce first-best allocations by implementing truth-telling mechanisms. Hence, depending on the nature of the participation constraints, the regulator may use incentive payments or fees, either financed by lump-sum taxes or by (re-)distributing a resulting surplus in a lump-sum way back to consumers. If, by contrast, the regulator is constrained by a balanced budget for the total incentive payments, only second-best outcomes can be induced (except for special cases). Kwerel (1977) suggests a very simple mechanism for eliciting firms' marginal abatement cost functions. He proposes asking firms to submit their marginal abatement cost curves and, according to their reports, issuing emission permits complemented by subsidies to be paid for reducing emissions beyond what the holding of emission permits stipulates. Dasgupta et al. (1980) suggest a tax-subsidy scheme, extending Kwerel's mechanism to more general environments (such as non-competitive permit markets and heterogeneous pollutants), which induces truth-telling in dominant strategies. Montero (2008) shows, however, that Kwerel's mechanism works only under special conditions. He also indicates that the tax-subsidy scheme by Dasgupta et al. (1980) fails to allocate resources efficiently if aggregate permit supply is fixed. Montero then develops a general incentive-compatible mechanism for eliciting the firms' abatement costs and, in accordance with the firms' reports, regulating emissions in an optimal way. His mechanism is applicable to a wide range of settings, including situations where the pollution permit market is not perfectly competitive.====In a nutshell, Montero's mechanism works as follows: In a first step, the regulator asks the firms to submit their marginal abatement cost schedules, or equivalently, their demand functions for emission permits. Taking these reported marginal abatement cost curves as their true functions, the regulator aggregates these to obtain the aggregate marginal abatement cost curve (or equivalently, the aggregate demand for permits) and then sets the total emission cap by intersecting the resulting aggregate marginal abatement-cost curve with the marginal-damage curve. This yields an optimal emission cap which is then allocated to the firms at ==== individual prices. In equilibrium with truth-telling, these prices are equal across firms and correspond to the social marginal damage. In a final step, the regulator reimburses the firms individually by paying back a fraction of their permit expenditures. The auction rules assure that the permit allocation is ==== efficient. Note that under this mechanism, truth-telling is not only a Nash equilibrium but even an equilibrium in dominant strategies. Furthermore, firms pay a net amount equal to their contribution to pollution damages. In this sense, the mechanism is also ==== equitable from a polluter-pays-principle perspective. We describe this mechanism in detail in section 2.====In the present paper we make use of the controlled environment in the laboratory (e.g., Smith, 1980, 1982; Falk and Heckman, 2009) to test Montero's mechanism. We compare it with two well-known alternative mechanisms, where the regulator asks the firms to submit their (marginal) abatement cost schedules in a simultaneous bid auction to determine the price and amount of permits. Then, the regulator either allocates the permits for free (“free allocation”) or charges firms the full costs of the permits at Pigouvian prices (“costly allocation”).====In the experiment, the cost schedule is the same for each firm, but maximal emissions are private information and vary across firms. In all three mechanisms investigated, the regulator asks firms to report their maximal emissions, then uses this information to determine emission caps and prices. Hence, in all three mechanisms the allocation of permits is determined by the same (simultaneous bid) auction. The three mechanisms that we are comparing are: (i) “free allocation”, (ii) “(fully) costly allocation”(for short: “costly allocation”), where firms are required to fully pay for the permits, and (iii) the incentive-compatible Montero mechanism, where firms partially pay for the permits, referred to as “refunding”. We conducted treatments with industries consisting of one, two, or three firms, where firms are assigned one of three different maximal emission levels. We restricted our experimental comparison of the three mechanisms to industries with a small number of firms (up to three) because in Montero's mechanism the share of refunded revenues decreases sharply with an increase in the number of firms, so that theoretically, when three or more firms are subject to regulation, there is hardly any difference between the Montero mechanism and auctioning off permits at the full Pigouvian price.====While emission permit markets for major pollutants such as SO==== and CO==== are typically very large, examples with small number of firms do exist, notably regional pollution markets including locally restricted cases of air or water pollution (e.g., Borghesi, 2014; Muller et al., 2002; Sunnevåg, 2003). In this respect, Muller et al. (2002, p.72) note that in 2001 the Ontario Ministry of the Environment announced a mandatory cap on NO==== and SO==== emissions from six generation stations, all owned by a single firm (Ontario Power Generation). Borghesi (2014) describes tradable water pollution rights in Lake Dillon, Colorado, with only four municipal waste water treatment plants.====With respect to its theoretical foundations, this paper draws on the theory of incentive compatible mechanisms, notably Kwerel (1977), Dasgupta et al. (1980), and especially Montero (2008) (see Montero, 2005, 2007 for preliminaries and extensions). It is also linked to the literature on incentive mechanisms with imperfect information, notably Roberts and Spence (1976) and Spulber (1988), as those mechanisms also result in approximately optimal or second-best optimal allocations, even if the regulator does not know the abatement costs. Regarding the experimental literature, our paper adds to the now extensive work on emission trading and markets (see e.g., Plott, 1983; Cason, 1995; Cason and Plott, 1996; Ben-David et al., 1999; Muller et al., 2002; Cason and Gangadharan, 2006; recent papers are e.g., Stranlund et al., 2014; and Holt and Shobe, 2016; - see also the review articles by Muller and Mestelman, 1998; Bohm, 2003; and Sturm and Weimann, 2006).====Our findings are as follows: We find that Montero's refunding mechanism works almost perfectly in the three industry sizes implemented in our experimental setting and for different maximal emission levels. Firms learn fast, and their decisions quickly converge to the socially optimal equilibrium. Under free allocation of permits, firms over-report their true emissions, which is fully in line with theoretical predictions. Free allocation is also the least efficient allocation mechanism in terms of overall abatement costs and damage. Under costly allocation of permits, again as predicted, firms under-report their true emissions. Yet in industries consisting of two or three firms, reported maximal emissions are close to their true values, and efficiency in these industries under costly allocation is almost perfect and no different from the efficiency under Montero's refunding mechanism. The reason is that the pecuniary externalities imposed by any one bidder becomes very small, and hence untruthful bidding becomes unprofitable. Thus, all in all, asking firms for their true maximal emissions and then auctioning off permits at Pigouvian prices, i.e. at full costs, is as good as the fully incentive-compatible refunding mechanism in industries that are larger than a monopoly. This is good news since it indicates that merely asking firms for their emissions schedule and simply auctioning off permits at full costs leads to virtually first-best results.====In the remainder of the paper we proceed as follows: In section 2 we describe and explain the Montero mechanism in detail. In section 3 we describe the experimental design and procedure. In section 4 we formulate our hypotheses, and in section 5 we present our results. In the final section we draw our conclusions and give some outlines for further research.

However, multiple studies have documented its mixed usefulness. Using meta-analysis of 67 studies identified after reviewing over 400 articles, we first show the efficacy of CT while controlling for publication bias. We then investigate when CT is likely to be effective. Our results indicate that on average CT is significant in reducing estimated economic values by about 20% compared to the baseline treatment without implementing CT. Further analysis demonstrates that using CT in the context of public goods, using a budget/substitute reminder, and using CT in conjunction with other HB mitigation strategies improves its efficacy. In addition, we show that CT works better when the actual HB is larger thus one potential reason for previous studies failing to identify positive reduction in potential HB through CT may be because actual HB is small instead of CT being ineffective.","Practitioners of stated preference approaches to valuation are well aware of Hypothetical Bias (HB), a situation in which welfare estimates, usually Willingness to Pay (WTP), generated from hypothetical valuations are often greater, than values that are derived from valuations with real==== and binding outcomes. Consequently, many have studied the effect of experimental protocols such as elicitation mechanism (Cameron et al., 2002; Vossler and Holladay, 2016) or survey mode (Ethier et al., 2000; Menegaki et al., 2016) used on the magnitude of economic values and associated HB.====Another venue is to mitigate HB within the given context of a valuation study, often coming in two popular forms, ==== and ====. Ex post approaches often pose questions after the survey's valuation exercise in order to calibrate WTP (Champ et al., 1997; Fox et al., 1998; Schulze et al., 1998). On the other hand, ==== approaches attempt to persuade and remind the respondent to give more thoughtful answers prior to the valuation question, hoping to more closely reflect the respondent's true preferences of a real purchasing decision.====One of the most prominent examples of an ==== approach to HB mitigation is Cheap Talk (CT). CT was made popular by Cummings and Taylor (1999), who found that WTP in hypothetical treatments with CT was not different than WTP in real treatments for multiple goods. Since that time, CT has become routine in survey and elicitation design in stated preferences, but its usefulness is still sometimes called into question.====The circumstances under which CT is effective, if at all, remain elusive. The central goal of this study is to understand the average effectiveness of CT based on a meta-analysis of existing studies. It also investigates the circumstances under which CT is most or least likely to be effective, both as it relates to the features of the actual CT script as well as to the features of the broader valuation context it was implemented in. Our findings reveal a possibility that seems to be largely ignored by the previous literature that when a CT script is found to be ineffective, it may instead be due to lack of HB rather than an unsuccessful application of CT.",Cheap talk efficacy under potential and actual Hypothetical Bias: A meta-analysis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069618300111,27 February 2019,2019,Research Article,315.0

In this paper, we examine the ==== daily increase based on the average transaction volume and price on a typical day in Beijing. The heterogeneity analysis further suggests that this effect is mostly driven by non-local and low income buyers. After ruling out rational explanations, we demonstrate that our empirical results are consistent with salience theory under weak assumptions.","The air pollution problems in developing countries have drawn considerable public attention from policy makers and researchers. A growing strand of literature tries to understand how air pollution affects individual behaviors. For instance, people may purchase masks and air purifiers to protect themselves from polluted air (Ito and Zhang, 2016). Alternatively, they may be more willing to migrate to cleaner cities or countries as a more expensive averting measure (Qin and Zhu, 2018). In addition to averting behaviors, air pollution may induce other behavioral changes in the context of insurance purchases (Chang et al., 2017), stock investments (Li et al., 2017), and decision-making in the lab (Chew et al., 2017).====In this paper, we examine the impact of air pollution on the real estate market in Beijing. In particular, we examine the ==== effects of severe air pollution on housing purchases. Housing transactions are an economically important outcome because the monetary amount associated with each transaction is large relative to households' income, and the consequences of housing purchases can endure for a long period or even one's entire life. We believe that this particular setting is suitable to test for immediate behavioral responses or behavioral biases for two reasons. First, given the extraordinarily high housing prices in Beijing, purchasing a house is a monumental decision in one's life; thus, it would be difficult to imagine that a buyer deliberately changes her mind just because of the air pollution on the contracting date. Second, as shown in Fig. 1, air pollution is a relatively common phenomenon in Beijing, and people usually are not surprised by a severely polluted day.==== Therefore, observing a single polluted day should not change their belief over the long term about the local air pollution level; thus, this phenomenon should not change their mind about how much to spend on a house.====A barrier to studying the impacts of air pollution on housing deal negotiations is that the types of data available to the researchers do not have information on the specific date that the buyer and seller negotiate the price, which is the most relevant occasion to examine the immediate behavioral response to air pollution. In this study, we have access to a major housing brokerage firm's transaction data in Beijing with more than 100,000 transactions of resale (as opposed to new sale) houses. There are three unique features of the data for research purposes. Firstly, the data record the exact date when the buyer and seller negotiated the price and signed the contract immediately after, allowing us to match the air pollution level of the negotiation day to the housing transactions. Secondly, unlike most studies that examine purchasing behavior in a posted price context, we observe the deal price of each transaction. This helps us rule out some rational explanations for the empirical results. Lastly, the data provide basic demographics of the buyers, including their birth place, age, and gender, as well as characteristics of the houses. This feature allows us to further test possible mechanisms with heterogeneity analyses.====In addition to the unique features of the dataset, the context of housing market and air pollution is different from other commodity markets in the literature. That is, the immediate or contemporaneous effects of heavy air pollution on housing values may be different from its long-run effects. Matching the air pollution level for the date when the buyers and sellers negotiate the price and sign the contract with the actual transaction price, we find that the transaction prices on a severely polluted day (i.e., with PM==== level higher than 350) are 0.65% higher than those of the days without pollution (i.e., with PM==== level lower than 35), after controlling for housing characteristics, community effects, year-by-month effects, day-of-the-week effects, weather, and holidays. Using the average transaction price and volume on a typical day, the calculated total increase in overall value of housing sold is about 3.51 million ====. This effect is mainly driven by non-local buyers who are buying smaller units. Given that days with moderate pollution in Beijing are common, this is an economically significant amount. In addition to the effect on transaction price, we find that the transaction volumes do not decline and might in fact be higher on severely polluted days. Hence, selection is not an explanation of our empirical findings. We also rule out two other alternative explanations – the results are due to pollution's effect on the cognitive ability of home buyers and buyers' information update about the local pollution level.====Our evidence suggests that the positive association between air pollution and housing transaction prices is likely due to relative or salience thinking==== of home buyers (Bordalo et al., 2012, 2013a,b) under fairly weak assumptions. Because buyers have entered the last stage of buying a house, they have determined to work and live in Beijing and moving away from the city is no longer in their choice set. Hence, buyers only choose to stay in the current residence or to purchase the house and move to a new residence which is also in Beijing. Air pollution causes a decline in living quality. In this particular context, air pollution causes the same negative shock to current living quality (i.e. current residence) and potential future living quality (i.e. residence planning to purchase). However, although the absolute difference between potential future living quality and current living quality stays unchanged, the ==== improvement in living quality over the current one actually increases on polluted days. Assuming that living quality can be quantified with numbers, this intuition can be shown with a simple numerical example. If the current living quality is 100 and the new house provides a living quality of 150, the absolute increase in living quality is 50 and the proportional increase is 50/100 = 50%. With air pollution negatively influencing living qualities (e.g. −20), the absolute difference is still 50 but the proportional increase is now 50/(100-20) = 62.5%. Due to relative thinking, buyers tend to think a 62.5% increase being more attractive than a 50% increase and thus are willing to pay a higher price for this improvement.====In the language of salience theory, when considering different living alternatives, the buyer's attention is drawn more to living quality by its larger relative change due to pollution; thus, price becomes less salient. Consequently, on a polluted day, buyers would be more likely to accept a higher price in the price negotiation, which then leads to a higher probability of a deal if the sellers do not change their behavior according to air pollution levels. We find that the behavioral response likely pertains to those buyers currently having lower living qualities. Consistently, we find no effect of air pollution on transaction prices of local buyers who likely already owned a house in Beijing prior to the transaction or living together with their families. In addition, the effect pertains to those non-local buyers and who are buying smaller units. As supplementary evidence, we find that Baidu's (a search engine in China similar to Google) searches for home-purchase related key words significantly increase on polluted days. In addition, the number of website visits to Soufun, a national housing brokerage firm in China, increases on polluted days as well. All of this evidence collected from different sources indicates that people tend to value housing more on polluted days due to the salience of living quality improvement.====Our paper makes two major contributions. First, we provide the first evidence consistent with salience theory in the housing market. Decisions made by housing market participants are substantial for their lifetime well-being. Thus, behavioral biases are likely to lead to unfavorable outcomes. Busse et al. (2015); Conlin et al. (2007), among others, assert the importance of testing for behavioral bias in the housing market in their studies on projection bias. Unlike purchasing winter clothes or a car, mistakes in the housing market endure for a much longer time and are much more costly to correct. According to our review of the literature, we are also the first to test salience in a bilateral negotiation setting. All empirical studies (e.g. Busse et al. (2015)) that we are aware of have relied on the volume of transactions or propensity of purchasing to demonstrate behavioral biases such as projection bias or salience. We differentiate ourselves by examining both transaction price (thus inferring willingness to pay) and volumes in our empirical analysis.====Second, we contribute to the rich literature on the consequences of air pollution by studying its contemporaneous effect on housing transactions. In particular, our research is most relevant to the papers studying the impact of air pollution in the housing market and financial market. Chay and Greenstone (2005) find that a lower level of air pollution induced by the Clean Air Act in the mid-1970s is associated with higher housing prices at that time. Instead of examining the relatively long-run effect of air pollution on housing prices, the current study focuses on the contemporaneous effect of air pollution on housing prices due to individual irrationality, which has never been documented in the air pollution literature. Such behavioral distortion has important welfare implications because the monetary loss associated with such an effect is non-negligible. In the stock market, a paper by Heyes et al. (2016) suggests that a higher level of PM==== in Manhattan is associated with significantly lower same-day stock returns, which is likely driven by pollution-induced changes in mood or cognitive function. Our research is also closely related to a growing body of literature studying the consequences of air pollution in China, which is one of the most pressing social problems in this country (Chen et al., 2016, 2013a,b; He et al., 2016; Ito and Zhang, 2016; Liu and Salvo, 2018; Qin and Zhu, 2018; Sun et al., 2017; Viard and Fu, 2015; Zhang and Mu, 2017; Zhang et al., 2017).====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the background information on the housing market in Beijing; Section 3 presents the air pollution data and housing transaction data; Section 4 discusses the hypotheses and identification strategy including instrumental variable estimation; Section 5 presents the main results; Section 6 discusses possible rational explanations for these results; Section 7 proposes behavioral explanations; and Section 8 concludes.",Negotiating housing deal on a polluted day: Consequences and possible explanations,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069618305151,March 2019,2019,Research Article,316.0

I rely on a survey of experts to elicit opinions regarding (1) probabilities of alternative economic outcomes of climate change, but not the causes of those outcomes; and (2) the reduction in emissions required to avert an extreme outcome, i.e., a large climate-induced reduction in GDP. The average SCC is the ratio of the present value of lost GDP from an extreme outcome to the total emission reduction needed to avert that outcome. I discuss the survey instrument, explain how experts were identified, and present results. I obtain SCC estimates of $200/mt or higher, but the variation across experts is large. Trimming outliers and focusing on experts who expressed a high degree of confidence in their answers yields lower SCCs, $80 to $100/mt, but still well above the IAM-based estimates used by the U.S. government.","An estimate of the social cost of carbon (SCC) is a crucial input to the development of climate policy. The SCC measures the external cost of burning carbon, so pricing carbon at its full social cost (e.g., by imposing a carbon tax) requires an estimate of the SCC.====How should we estimate the SCC? A common approach uses an integrated assessment model (IAM) to simulate time paths for the atmospheric CO==== concentration (based on an assumed path of CO==== emissions), its impact on temperature (and perhaps other measures of climate change), and the resulting reductions in GDP and consumption. One starts with a base case scenario, i.e., a path for current and future CO==== emissions (which implies a path for temperature, GDP, etc.). Next, the path is perturbed by increasing current emissions by one ton, and then calculating a new (slightly lower) path for consumption. The SCC is then the present value of the reductions in future consumption resulting from the additional ton of emissions (using some discount rate). This is how the U.S. government's Interagency Working Group (IWG) estimated the SCC.====Some of the equations that go into IAMs — especially the damage functions that translate higher temperatures into reductions in GDP — lack a clear theoretical or empirical grounding.==== As a result, these models tell us little about the likelihood of a catastrophic climate outcome, e.g., a temperature increase above 4 °C that greatly impacts GDP.==== But as I will show, it is the possibility of a catastrophic outcome that is the main driver of the SCC. If we knew that temperature increases and their economic impact will be small or moderate, we could conclude that the SCC is not large. But we do ==== know that this will be the case.====But if we don't use one or more IAMs to estimate the SCC, what can we do instead? This paper provides an alternative approach to estimating the SCC that relies on a survey of experts, in which they are asked their opinions regarding certain inputs to an SCC calculation: (1) the probabilities of alternative economic outcomes of climate change, especially extreme outcomes, but ==== the causes of those outcomes; and (2) the reduction in emissions required to avoid an extreme or catastrophic outcome. For example, a catastrophic outcome might be a 20% or greater reduction in GDP. Whether that outcome is the result of a large increase in temperature but moderate impact of temperature on GDP, or the opposite, is not of concern for this study. What matters is the likelihood of such an outcome, and the abatement needed to avert it.====Focusing on catastrophic outcomes both simplifies and complicates the problem of estimating the SCC. It simplifies the problem by allowing us to focus on only a subset of possible outcomes, namely the more extreme ones, and not on the causes of the outcomes. This is consistent with the very notion of an SCC — the economic harm caused by emitting an additional ton of CO====, irrespective of the economic and climate mechanisms that generate the harm. (Of course climate change could also cause non-economic damages, such as greater morbidity and mortality, the extinction of species, and social disruptions. I am assuming, as is typically done in the estimation of the SCC, that these non-economic damages could be monetized and included as part of the drop in GDP.)====Focusing on catastrophic outcomes also complicates matters because we know so little about the likelihood they will occur. But that in turn supports the approach I take here. The use of a complex model throws a curtain over our lack of knowledge, and suggests we know more than we do. The use of a survey is more transparent and summarizes the views (however obtained) of researchers who have studied climate change and its impact. This approach acknowledges that currently the best we can do — especially with regard to extreme outcomes — is rely on the opinions of experts.====How do we know that a possible catastrophic outcome is what matters for the SCC? Because unless we are ready to accept a discount rate on consumption that is extremely small (e.g., around 1%), the “most likely” scenarios for climate change cannot generate enough damages — in present value terms — to matter.==== The information obtained from a survey of experts can shed light on this point. A low SCC estimate could result if experts think the discount rate should be the roughly 3% used in IAMs, or if experts think the likelihood of catastrophic damages is very low, or both. A high SCC estimate could result if experts think the discount rate should be very low (which we will see is not the case for the vast majority of those surveyed), or if they think the likelihood of catastrophic damages is substantial (which we will see is indeed the case for many of the experts surveyed).====One might argue that the approach used here involves a model, but it is one with very few moving parts. It works as follows:====For an economist, relying on expert opinion might not seem very satisfying. Economists often build models to avoid relying on subjective (expert or otherwise) opinions. But the inputs to IAMs (equations and parameter values) are already the result of expert opinion; in this case the modeler is the “expert.” This is especially true when it comes to climate change impacts, where theory and data provide little guidance. Also, we would expect that different experts will arrive at their opinions in different ways. Some might base their opinions on one or more IAMs, others on their studies of climate change and its impact, and others might combine information from models with other insights. In this paper, the methods experts use to arrive at their opinions is not a variable of interest (although it might well be of interest for those who pursue variants of my survey approach). What matters here is that the experts are selected based on their established expertise.====Experts, of course, are likely to disagree, but that is actually an advantage of this type of survey. Given the weak state of the underlying science and economics, it is important to get a better understanding of the range of opinion and the nature and extent of disagreement. For example, do the opinions of climate scientists differ from those of economists, and if so, how? Are there systematic differences of opinion across experts in the U.S. versus Europe? And what is the range of disagreement? The survey addresses these questions.====It turns out that there is considerable heterogeneity across experts, leading to a wide variation in the implied SCC numbers. This may simply reflect our very limited knowledge of the underlying science and economics. It therefore casts additional doubt on the use of an IAM — which implicitly presumes substantial knowledge of the underlying science and economics — to estimate the SCC. But the wide variation also means that there is no single SCC estimate that can be inferred from my survey results. Put simply, I cannot provide a specific SCC estimate, or even a narrow range, as a “conclusion” to this study.====So what can we conclude from this study? Several interesting things, which can be summarized as follows:====The estimation framework and survey approach developed in this paper has been described in an earlier paper (Pindyck, 2017a). Thus the discussion here will focus on the key equations and on the intuition behind the estimation framework, with some of the details relegated to the Appendix. The earlier paper also presented results of a small pilot survey given to 20 environmental economists, 11 of whom completed the survey questions, but using different probability distributions for climate outcomes than in this paper. The results of that pilot survey implied an SCC estimate of $101 per metric ton, which is well above the numbers commonly used in analyses of climate policy. As we will see, the results presented here imply an even higher number for the SCC.====This paper differs from and adds to Pindyck (2017a) in other ways as well, largely because here I have survey results for several hundred heterogeneous respondents. This allows me test alternative probability distributions for climate change outcomes (the fit of the Pareto distribution, for example, is strongly rejected). It allows me to evaluate the extent to which the SCC is driven by the possibility of an extreme outcome. And it allows me to compare the beliefs of different groups of experts — e.g., climate scientists versus economists, Europeans versus North Americans, and perhaps most importantly, respondents who have a high degree of confidence in their views versus those who do not.====The next section presents the methodology used to estimate the SCC. I begin with an example of a set of climate outcomes and their probabilities, and show how those numbers can be translated into an outcome probability distribution. I then explain the calculation of an average SCC. In Sections 3 A survey approach to estimating the SCC, 4 The survey discuss details of the SCC calculations, the selection of experts, and the questionnaire used to elicit their opinions. The survey results are presented in Section 5. I estimate the SCC for each individual respondent, for the full set of respondents, and for subsets based expertise (economics vs. climate science) and geographical location. I show how the SCC estimates vary across individuals and the extent to which the variation is due to area of expertise and/or location. I also show that the SCC estimates are smaller when derived from a trimmed sample that excludes outliers and includes only respondents who expressed high confidence in their answers. I also discuss some of the problems with my survey, and how they might bias the results. Section 6 concludes with a discussion of how this analysis might be modified, and suggestions for further work.",The social cost of carbon revisited,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069617307131,March 2019,2019,Research Article,317.0

We classify environmental media releases by informational content and value relevance, and assess the abnormal ==== of each type of event. While announcements of future environmental activities lead to the largest favorable stock market reactions, there is no guaranteed link from this type of information to environmental outcomes. Further analysis of the abnormal returns shows that the magnitude of the stock market reaction depends on firm financial characteristics across all event types rather than on firm environmental performance. Our results indicate that the ability for voluntary environmental information disclosure to induce environmental self-regulation is limited to the extent that firms are able to follow through with their announcements of planned environmental activities.","Environmental economists have generated nearly unanimous empirical evidence that public news regarding negative environmental performance of a firm leads to significantly negative financial outcomes for the firm. For example, the initial response of the stock market to mandatory reporting of pollution data in the Toxics Release Inventory was a significantly negative shock to firm returns (Hamilton, 1995), and the stock market loss was larger for more polluting firms relative to firms with better environmental performance (Khanna et al., 1998; Lanoie et al., 1998). Capelle-Blancard and Laguna (2010) find that the stock market reacts significantly to news of chemical disasters, and that the loss in value is related to the seriousness of the disaster. Konar and Cohen (2001) show that poor environmental performance has a significant effect on a firm's intangible asset value, or environmental reputation.====A quite powerful implication of these empirical findings is the opportunity for public information regarding a firm's environmental performance to serve as a lever through which environmental policymakers can augment existing regulations (Konar and Cohen, 1997; Khanna et al., 1998). A firm responds to financial incentives – if environmental liabilities lead to financial liabilities, a firm adjusts its behavior to improve performance. Policymakers can exploit the firm's incentive to reduce pollution (Konar and Cohen, 1997; Khanna et al., 1998) and improve its environmental reputation (Konar and Cohen, 2001; Flammer, 2013). For example, Khanna et al. (1998) show that the release of public information on toxic releases can effectively induce firms to reduce on-site releases and increase off-site transfer of waste.====Our contribution is to assess the extent to which public information regarding ==== environmental news can also serve as a policy lever to induce firm self-regulation. However, unlike in the case of negative environmental information, the links between positive environmental activities, financial performance, and environmental improvements are not always clear. Negative information (e.g., pollution figures or a chemical disaster) signals responsibility for direct costs of clean up as well as indirect costs of long-term compliance, possible tightening of regulations, and issues related to management inefficiency. Yet, in the case of positive environmental information, these links are not well-defined. Should investors view positive environmental activities as long run costs, and respond adversely (Friedman, 1970)? Or, should investors applaud improved production efficiency and∕or a strengthened corporate reputation, and look forward to higher profits from increased product differentiation, consumer demand, and loyalty (Ambec and Lanoie, 2008)? We discuss these issues, and empirically examine the extent to which positive information might induce self-regulation.====Our work is related to the literature investigating firm motivation for participating in voluntary pollution abatement programs (Khanna and Damon, 1999; Vidovic and Khanna, 2007; Ervin et al., 2013) as well as the impact on firm value of environment-related activities (Klassen and McLaughlin, 1996; Khanna and Damon, 1999; Fisher-Vanden and Thorburn, 2011; Lyon and Shimshack, 2012; Oberndorfer et al., 2013). In line with our intuition that the links between environmental information, financial performance, and environmental quality are not always clear, is a lack of consensus as to firm motivation for participating in voluntary pollution abatement programs, the impact of voluntary abatement initiatives on environmental outcomes, and the impact of these activities on firm financial performance.====Our work builds on previous research in several important ways. Instead of focusing exclusively on environmental activities of a particular type such as winning an environmental award (e.g., Klassen and McLaughlin, 1996; Lyon and Shimshack, 2012; Lyon et al., 2013) or related to participation in a particular program (e.g., Fisher-Vanden and Thorburn, 2011), we focus on a wide array of environmental activities. We use the scope of these activities to explore differences in information contained in different types of events, so that we can better understand the signal that public information regarding different positive environmental activities transmits to investors as well as environmental policymakers. The scope of our analysis allows us to identify factors contributing to the lack of consensus in previous research and to create a framework under which we begin to understand the inconsistent findings within the literature.====Using information from 308 media releases between January 2005 and December 2014, we conduct an event study to assess the magnitude of the stock market response to the release of information regarding positive environmental activities. In addition to standard conditional mean regressions and normally distributed test statistics, we use standardized and nonparametric test statistics that are designed to address poor performance issues commonly associated with standard statistical tests (Corrado, 1989; Cowan, 1992; Acharya, 1993; Corrado, 2011). We find that self-made announcements of planned future activities generate a significant stock market reaction and bear the largest increase in stock returns among all environmental media releases in our sample. We investigate whether firms release positive environmental information strategically, and we find some evidence that positive environmental news may be released strategically to offset the potentially unfavorable stock market reaction to negative information.====From a policy perspective, the disclosure of environmental information can augment formal environmental regulation by inducing a firm to improve its environmental performance above and beyond what is legally mandated. For this to happen, it is necessary that the event describes an activity that likely leads to environmental change, and that the link between positive environmental activities and financial incentives depends significantly on actual environmental performance. That is, positive environmental information can induce firm self-regulation and augment traditional regulation only if such information is associated with realized environmental outcomes. We assess the link between news about positive environmental activities and environmental performance in two ways. First, in examining the stock market response to the events, we focus on the nature of the information in different types of events – such as the degree of details about the environmental activity, and the timing/stage of the activity being described – to assess which types of events most likely indicate actual environmental change. Second, when explaining the association between the magnitude of the stock market reaction and various firm characteristics, we incorporate four different firm-level indices that measure firm transparency in environmental activities and environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) activities, firm environmental performance, and overall ESG performance (Flammer, 2013).==== This allows us to ascertain whether investors are more likely to respond favorably to news of positive environmental activities for firms that are merely transparent in their environmental activities, or to firms that have established a track record of environmental improvements.====Among all the media release types that we consider – descriptions of past actions, announcements of planned future activity, recognition by a third party for environmental stewardship, and annual reports describing environmental goals and accomplishments – we find that the market reacts most strongly to announcements of planned future activity because these announcements contain the most new information content. We also find that the primary determinants of the magnitude of the stock market reaction are firm financial characteristics; among firm environmental characteristics, the stock market reaction depends on firm overall corporate social responsibility performance, rather than environmental performance per se.",Good news for environmental self-regulation?

However, if ","Pollution taxes typically hurt the poor more than the rich, since the poor consume relatively more polluting goods than the rich.==== Moreover, the poor may be more exposed to pollution damages than the rich.==== Therefore, our first question is whether and, if so how, the optimal setting of pollution taxes should take into account distributional concerns. Our second question is whether Pareto-improving green tax reforms exist that raise pollution taxes, while no one is being made worse off. To answer these two questions, we extend the standard analyses of pollution and income taxes in Sandmo (1975) and Bovenberg and De Mooij (1994) with heterogeneous individuals that differ in their gross earnings per hour worked and by how much they suffer from pollution damages. Besides the externalities from pollution, there are no other pre-existing tax and non-tax distortions in the economy. Maximisation of social welfare implies that the government cares about pollution damages, income redistribution, and distortions in the labour market. Pollution taxes thus serve potentially three goals: internalising externalities, redistributing income, and alleviating labour market distortions.====Our first main result is that pollution taxes should generally take into account distributional concerns if Engel curves for polluting goods are non-linear. Empirical studies document that linear Engel curves are rejected by the data (e.g. Banks and Lewbel, 1997; Tovar Reaños and Wölfing, 2018).3, 4==== If pollution taxes are regressive, they cause distributional losses and optimal pollution taxes should be set below the Pigouvian tax – ceteris paribus.==== Consequently, the government sacrifices on its environmental priorities to redistribute more income. Moreover, pollution taxes can be driven below Pigouvian rates for efficiency reasons, since they generally raise the marginal tax wedge on labour, and thus exacerbate labour market distortions caused by the labour income tax, as is known from the literature on the double dividend (e.g. Sandmo, 1975, 2000; Bovenberg and De Mooij, 1994; Bovenberg and van der Ploeg, 1994; Goulder, 1995; Bovenberg, 1998, 1999).====However, we show that if Engel curves for polluting goods are linear, then optimal corrective taxes follow the first-best Pigouvian rule even in second-best situations with distortionary taxation and heterogeneous pollution damages. However, the first-best Pigouvian rule for the optimal pollution tax is evaluated at the second-best rather than the first-best allocation.==== Consequently, if Engel curves for polluting goods are linear, then distributional concerns should ==== play a role in setting pollution taxes. Intuitively, with linear Engel curves in demand for polluting goods, the linear pollution tax has the same distributional benefits and the same labour market distortions as the linear income tax, but in addition also distorts commodity demands. Hence, the pollution tax should be aimed only at internalising pollution externalities. We show that all utility functions belonging to the Gorman polar class yield linear Engel curves.==== We calibrate our model to empirical estimates for fuel demand and confirm our result that pollution taxes can deviate substantially from Pigouvian levels if Engel curves are non-linear.====We like to stress that, even if optimal second-best pollution taxes could be Pigouvian, this does not imply that distributional motives do not matter at all for setting optimal corrective taxes, only that the incidence of the corrective tax should not guide the optimal corrective tax. Indeed, if society cares more about inequality, and the poor are hurt relatively more by pollution damages, the equity-weighted Pigouvian pollution tax is higher (cf. Mirrlees, 1978; Anthoff et al., 2009; Anthoff and Tol, 2010).====Our second question is whether Pareto-improving green reforms are feasible starting from a situation of no or insufficient pollution taxation. We show that Pareto-improving tax reforms are feasible only if polluting goods demand features linear Engel curves. Intuitively, if Engel curves are linear, the government can always engineer a change in the linear income tax so that every individual gets a perfect compensation for the increase in linear pollution taxes. Such a tax reform keeps non-environmental welfare of all individuals constant, while reducing aggregate pollution and lowering government revenue. Hence, if pollution taxes are sub-optimally low in the initial situation, such a green tax reform unambiguously boosts social welfare. However, with non-linear Engel curves it is not possible to engineer Pareto-improving green tax reforms, since it is no longer possible to engineer a green tax reform that keeps everyone's non-environmental welfare fixed.====Our paper is related to four strands in the literature. A first strand in the literature analyses optimal corrective taxation and optimal income redistribution with non-linear income taxes, see Cremer and Gahvari (2001), Cremer et al. (1998, 2003), Micheletto (2008), Kaplow (2012), and Jacobs and de Mooij (2015). These papers show that optimal corrective taxes are set at Pigouvian levels if preferences are uniform and weakly separable between leisure and consumption. We extend this literature by analysing linear taxes, since real-world tax systems are not continuously non-linear like in the Mirrlees (1971) model, but (piece-wise) linear. We demonstrate that preferences not only need to be weakly separable, but also need to belong to the Gorman polar class of utility functions to have optimal corrective taxes at Pigouvian levels in second-best settings with distortionary income taxes.====A second strand in the literature analyses optimal corrective taxation and redistribution with linear taxes, see Diamond (1973), Sandmo (2000), Pirttilä and Schöb (1999) and Jacobs and de Mooij (2015). Diamond (1973) analyses optimal linear corrective taxes on ‘non-atmospheric’ externalities that can differ across individuals and where individualised lump-sum taxes can achieve income redistribution without distortions. Sandmo (2000), Pirttilä and Schöb (1999) and Jacobs and de Mooij (2015) analyse optimal linear corrective taxes on ‘atmospheric’ externalities and optimal linear income taxation in second-best settings with homogeneous externalities. These contributions show that optimal corrective taxes are generally geared towards income redistribution. Pirttilä and Schöb (1999) recognise that weak separability and linear Engel curves are needed to have optimal corrective taxes at Pigouvian levels, but they do not derive the conditions under which this is the case. Jacobs and de Mooij (2015) show that Pigouvian taxes result in the special case where preferences are weakly separable and homothetic. We extend these contributions on optimal linear corrective and income taxation by allowing for atmospheric externalities that may cause heterogeneous environmental damages across individuals. We derive that only Gorman polar utility functions yield linear Engel curves for polluting goods. Furthermore, we analyse green tax reforms with Gorman polar utility. Finally, we provide simulations with non-linear Engel curves for polluting goods to illustrate the importance of non-linear Engel curves for optimal corrective taxes.====A third and recent strand in the literature analyses environmental tax reforms, the recycling of revenue and the effects on income distribution (e.g. Klenert and Mattauch, 2016; Klenert et al., 2018a; Aubert and Chiroleu-Assouline, 2017).==== All these contributions employ Stone-Geary utility functions belonging to the Gorman polar class and argue that distributional consequences of pollution taxes are critically important to evaluate the consequences of green tax reforms. However, they do not recognise that optimal pollution taxes should ==== be targeted at income redistribution with Stone-Geary utility functions. Therefore, if pollution taxes are not optimised, one can ==== implement a green tax reform that is distribution neutral by a suitable adjustment of the income tax (i.e. a combination of a lower tax rate and a larger lump-sum transfer). By analysing different tax reforms, these papers may thus give the incorrect impression that distributional consequences of pollution taxes are key in the evaluation of green tax reforms if preferences are of the Stone-Geary form. Moreover, these authors do not recognise that tax reforms exist that unambiguously generate a better environment and while keeping equality constant under Stone-Geary utility. Our findings do not imply that the distributional impact of pollution taxes cannot be important. However, one must then move away from assuming Stone-Geary preferences.====A fourth and older strand in the literature studies the potential double dividend of pollution taxes, see for example Bovenberg and De Mooij (1994), Bovenberg and van der Ploeg (1994), Goulder (1995), Bovenberg (1998, 1999) and Sandmo (2000). By allowing for distributional concerns to motivate tax distortions, we show that both the weak and strong double dividends of environmental taxes no longer exist in the tax optimum. The weak double dividend does not apply, since recycling the proceeds of the pollution tax to cut distortionary labour taxes is no longer preferred over cutting lump-sum taxes, since in the tax optimum the marginal cost of public funds is equal for both labour and lump-sum taxes. Moreover, in the tax optimum the strong double dividend does not exist either. Intuitively, income taxes reduce income inequality, which has social marginal benefits that are in the optimum equal to the deadweight losses of the labour tax. Therefore, the marginal cost of public funds is equal to one for distortionary income taxes, and the government is not interested in cutting the labour tax with the proceeds of the pollution tax.====The outline of this paper is as follows. Section 2 sets up our model of income distribution and pollution damages. Section 3 derives the optimal taxes on income and pollution. Section 4 derives our result that the optimal pollution tax should not be directed at income distributional concerns if preferences are of the Gorman polar form. Section 5 shows that Pareto-improving green tax reforms exist if pollution taxes are not at their Pigouvian levels and preferences are of the Gorman polar form. Section 6 offers some stylised simulations to illustrate our analytical results. Section 7 discusses the instrument set of the government, heterogeneous preferences, externalities in production, and general equilibrium effects.

In equilibrium, the cartel is forced to deter the substitute, which thus imposes a price ceiling falling over time. Credible carbon taxes are below the Pigovian level, implying the importer cannot internalise the full pollution externality, much less capture resource rents. Without carbon pricing, the importer curtails long-run pollution using a costly R&D programme. Normatively, climate policy will be more expensive if relying on green R&D programmes only.","The dramatic fall in oil prices since 2014 has been widely interpreted as a change in the structure of the world oil market. The oil cartel OPEC now faces rapidly expanding output of substitutes to its exports, should the oil price be pushed above the break-even level for these. Such potential entry limits OPEC's ability to profitably raise prices, imposing a soft ‘price ceiling’. As technological advances keep lowering the cost of producing these substitutes, this price ceiling will get tighter over time, forcing oil prices to decline as well. Indeed, in December 2014, Ali al-Naimi, the former oil minister of Saudi Arabia—the dominant member of the petroleum supply cartel OPEC—suggested the rationale for letting prices fall was to force high-cost oil producers out, and said prices might never again reach $100/bbl.==== While the recent evolution of the market reflects the growth of the tight oil industry in the US, in the long run such competition is thought to come in the form of renewable, ‘green’ technologies.====Oil markets entwine together bilateral market power related to both trade policy and rent extraction (Karp, 1984; Fujiwara and Long, 2011), and environmental concerns (Wirl, 1994; Liski and Tahvonen, 2004). In this paper, I study equilibrium taxation of oil imports and development of green substitutes from a positive perspective, under the new technological landscape and associated market structure. I construct a model of oil cartel behaviour and strategic, gradual technological development which makes renewable substitutes cheaper and cheaper. These substitutes impose a ceiling on the price of oil. I then ask two questions.====First, can oil importers use carbon taxes to appropriate some of OPEC's oil rents? Not if OPEC engages in limit pricing. Limit pricing severely curtails the oil importers' ability to credibly tax resource rents. Indeed, the equilibrium carbon tax is below the Pigovian level (i.e. the present value of future marginal costs due to the emission of a tonne of carbon), instead reflecting the social cost of carbon should the importer have access to and exercise an ‘outside option’ of immediately shutting down the oil market. The importer's welfare is constrained to the level of this outside option; the exporter only gives away sufficient resource rents to induce the oil importer to remain a customer. This is in contrast to previous literature: without substitutes to oil, unless climate damages were quite severe, the importer would impose taxes above the Pigovian level, reflecting incentives to try to capture resource rents (Liski and Tahvonen, 2004).====Second, can importers bring the age of oil to a close by strategic development of substitutes? They can; but this is costly without carbon pricing. Oil producers supply as long as their margins for selling oil are positive. Carbon taxes can be used to cut these margins, and to close the oil business once its social value becomes nil. If oil-importing countries are unable to agree on a carbon pricing regime, they will instead resort to a crash research and development (R&D) programme. Such a programme seeks to push substitute production costs down very rapidly, so as to make oil uneconomic and shut a larger fraction of oil reserves underground for good.==== It may be optimal to curtail R&D before the crash programme starts, as cheaper substitutes will force more oil on the markets, exacerbating medium-term climate impacts. The programme will be more expensive than closing the oil market with a carbon tax while using R&D for its primary purpose of lowering the cost of energy. Thus carbon taxes cannot be fully substituted for by R&D-based climate policies.====To tackle these questions, I extend the Hoel (1978) model of a limit-pricing resource monopolist into a differential game.==== A resource cartel maximises profits from depleting the stock of a resource over time. The extraction of this resource is costly, the more so as the stock is depleted, and its use contributes to a stock pollutant. There exists a perfect substitute to the resource. The substitute is costly to produce, but an oil-importing coalition can lower this cost by R&D investment. Importantly, the technology improves gradually: small improvements today affect the residual demand the oil exporter faces tomorrow. The R&D process can thus be adjusted, and it is also observed by the monopolist, who can respond to it. The cartel, faced with inelastic demand and a perfect substitute that can be produced with constant returns to scale, will limit price; setting prices to just keep the substitute out of the market for as long as possible.====Liski and Tahvonen (2004) demonstrate how oil taxes will, in general, contain both a Pigovian component, used to internalise damages from pollution, and a trade policy component. In a set-up much like the one in the present paper, but without the backstop technology and associated R&D investment, they solve for a Markov-perfect Nash equilibrium under a linear-quadratic specification.==== The equilibrium in linear strategies features a trade policy component which can be either an import tariff or an import subsidy; the latter outcome occurs only when environmental damages are very serious. However, the robustness of this result to the choice of equilibrium, or to alternative functional specifications, is not explored. The present paper provides more unequivocal results. The backstop imposes a terminal condition, while limit pricing pins down the optimal actions. These features ensure the equilibrium is unique for quite general functional forms. The equilibrium carbon tax takes a very simple form even under a general functional specification. The trade policy component is always an import subsidy: when limit pricing, the monopolist is effectively trying to delay extraction as much as possible. The importer has an incentive to try to speed up extraction. A high carbon tax, if believed, would thus be lowered ====, and as a result, high taxes are not credible in the eyes of the exporter.====Limit pricing has recently been considered by Andrade de Sá and Daubanes (2016), who demonstrate how the response of a limit-pricing monopolist may neutralise the effect of carbon taxes on extraction. Their analysis takes the carbon tax and the price path of the perfect substitute as given, and also considers how the effects depend on the presence of a second, polluting, sufficiently inelastically supplied substitute. The present paper assumes a complementary stance and considers taxation (as well as R&D) in a Nash equilibrium with one, clean, substitute.====I also contribute to the literature on exhaustible resources and strategic substitute development. To date, this literature has assumed investments to be indivisible (e.g. Dasgupta et al., 1983; Gallini et al., 1983; Olsen, 1993; Gerlagh and Liski, 2011; Michielsen, 2014). An indivisible R&D program cannot be adjusted, nor flexibly responded to.==== I assume that the R&D process is both gradual and observable, and that the exporter can respond to it.====The importance of stock-dependent extraction costs and cumulative extraction, in tempering the ‘green paradox’ of Sinn (2008)—the perverse outcomes of supposedly environmental policies resulting from intertemporal supply-side responses by owners of fossil fuels—has been demonstrated by Gerlagh (2011) and Van der Ploeg and Withagen (2012). R&D policies accelerate extraction also in the present paper, due to a supply-side effect, namely limit pricing. Unlike the ‘green paradox’, this response is not related to intertemporal reallocation: the exporter is at all times at the corner solution imposed by the price ceiling constraint.====For an illustration of the strategic competition at the heart of this paper, consider Fig. 1, which displays the dominant automotive engine technology as a function of automotive battery prices and US fuel prices (Hensley et al., 2012). In 2011, fuel prices were just below the level at which hybrid-electric vehicles would become competitive. Improvements in battery technology would shift the US economy to the left, with battery-electric vehicles the dominant technology once battery prices fell to $350/kWh. However, the oil producers have a substantial margin they are able to cut were this to happen, shifting down along the border to only just stay in the region in which the internal combustion engine remains dominant. Even at the depressed crude oil prices in November 2014, almost 50% of the US gasoline price consisted of margins to a Middle East exporter, so the exporter could be pushed all the way to the bottom edge of the graph before going out of business.==== There is a lot of room for OPEC to cut, were importers trying to push the cartel out with an R&D program alone. This paper describes the process of R&D shifting the economy towards the left, oil exporters responding by reducing their margins, and a carbon tax closing the difference once oil becomes socially worthless.====As further empirical motivation for the notion that OPEC collectively does engage in limit pricing, consider Fig. 2. This plots the evolution of the breakeven price for the five most important tight oil plays in the US—that is, the WTI (West Texas Intermediate) crude oil price required for the average shale well to break even at the wellhead, on completion of the well. Technological progress has led to a clear downward trend in breakeven prices. The actual crude oil price is shown in bold. It is clear that this was well above the breakeven price in 2013 and 2014, associated with a sharp increase in the output of tight oil. This led to a price crash in 2014.==== OPEC's response was to not cut its output, allowing prices to fall to just the region of breakeven prices. The growth in US production of tight oil has consequently stopped, and could plausibly decline, depending on the future evolution of oil prices. This suggests that the major producers of conventional oil are indeed following a limit-pricing strategy.==== In this paper, I construct a simplified model to shed light on the basic mechanisms underlying such dynamic limit pricing, and strategic carbon taxation and development of clean substitutes.====From a technical perspective, I demonstrate how three properties of the model—monotonic evolution of the state variables, the natural boundary condition of exhaustibility and a discontinuous objective function for one player—make the game particularly simple to analyse. The equilibrium is unique and can be characterised very precisely, in an asymmetric, bivariate set-up, without resorting to specific functional forms.====The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 develops the basic model. Section 3 obtains the efficient benchmark. Section 4 defines the strategic set-up and solves for the Nash equilibrium. Section 5 considers the equilibrium when the tax instrument is not available. Section 6 concludes.","Carbon taxation, OPEC and the end of oil",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069618304467,March 2019,2019,Research Article,320.0

Using a unique sample of Danish firms from 1996 to 2012, we find that CEO education significantly improves firms' energy efficiency. We seek to derive causality using health shocks: the hospitalization of highly educated CEOs induces a drop in energy efficiency, whereas the hospitalization of less educated CEOs does not have any significant effect. Exploring the mechanisms at play, we show that our results are largely driven by advanced education in business degrees. Moreover, we show that CEO education is associated with greater environmental awareness: highly educated CEOs exhibit greater concerns for climate change, as measured by a survey of ====, and drive more environmentally efficient cars. Taken together, our findings suggest that education shapes managerial styles giving rise to greater sustainability in corporate actions.","This paper analyzes the effect of CEO education on environmental decision-making. Several works in the literature have been devoted to quantifying the impact of human capital on economic outcomes such as labor market returns (e.g. Card, 2001), financial decision-making (e.g. Cole et al., 2014, Black et al., 2018) and lifetime wealth (e.g. Oreopoulos, 2007). Moreover, the literature has suggested that education is not only beneficial for individuals but may breed benefits to the entire society.==== This argument can be traced back to at least Friedman (1955: pg. 2), who noted that ‘‘A stable and democratic society is impossible without a minimum degree of literacy and knowledge on the part of most citizens and without widespread acceptance of some common set of values. Education can contribute to both. In consequence, the gain from education of a child accrues not only to the child or to his parents but also to other members of the society’’. More recently, Putnam (1995: pg. 672) argued that “education is by far the strongest correlate that I have discovered of civic engagement in all its forms.” Empirical studies provide support for this view by showing that education increases voter participation, support for free speech, public awareness and political involvement (Dee, 2004, Milligan et al., 2004).==== Along this line, Meyer (2015) shows that educated individuals are more concerned about social welfare and environmental issues, while Volland (2017) documents that social trust is negatively correlated with energy demand at the household level.====We contribute to this literature by studying the impact of education on a CEO's environmental stance. We find that better educated CEOs reduce their environmental footprint by spurring corporate energy efficiency and making greener private decisions. CEOs provide a context of utmost importance for our study. First, CEOs have ultimate influence on corporate policies, which may amplify the consequences of their personal environmental commitment (or lack thereof). Second, CEO decisions may significantly affect the environmental sustainability of other firms in the value chain (Dai et al., 2018) via e.g. stakeholder engagement, imitation and knowledge transfer. Despite such relevance, the effect of CEO traits on firms' environmental policies remains, to our knowledge, largely unexplored.====We collect data from the Danish Environmental Protection Agency data covering the energy consumption of 428 Danish manufacturing companies from 1996 to 2012. For each of these companies, we gather register data on CEOs' education and several other demographic characteristics. Our results indicate that firms led by highly educated CEOs use significantly less energy per output. In economic terms, an additional year of CEO education is associated with 7% lower electricity and 17% lower gas (all scaled by employees), as well as a 20% higher efficiency in a composite index based on the use of energy inputs within a given industry.====While this result holds controlling for several variables related to the industry, firm and CEO level, we acknowledge that the endogenous matching between companies and CEOs poses an empirical challenge to interpret our results causally. We try to overcome this challenge by exploiting CEO hospitalization events. As argued in Bennedsen et al. (2018), this approach helps to tease out the causal effect of CEOs on corporate policies given that hospitalization events exogenously change CEO exposure without altering the CEO-firm match. The hospitalization of highly educated CEOs may lower current energy use through at least two channels. First, environmental projects typically rest on cognitively demanding tasks that require changes in existing routines and novel recombination of existing approaches. When highly educated CEOs are hospitalized, there is a sudden lack of leadership inputs which impairs energy-related projects, in particular if other top managers have to cover up for the absent CEO on the part of the CEO job that is not related to energy projects. Second, hospitalization induces an increase in CEO's personal risk. Hospitalized CEOs may be spending effort and time on personal well-being, and may even start to consider leaving the helm of the company. This process takes focus away from such complex activities as energy-preserving projects. Moreover, hospitalization may reduce a CEO's ability and incentives to monitor the activities of the company, and thus weakens employees' incentive to work hard on energy-saving tasks. Customers and suppliers may also face weaker incentives to invest in complex relationship with firms led by hospitalized CEOs, thus reducing the resources available to energy-related projects. Our results indicate that, as compared to CEOs without college education, the hospitalization of highly educated CEOs has a significant and negative effect on firms' electricity efficiency: for an additional day that highly educated CEOs spend in the hospital, the electricity efficiency of their firms declines by 7%–9% depending on the specification.====There are two interpretations for our findings so far. The first builds on the notion that education spurs managerial efficiency: accordingly, more educated managers may be better able to identify and pursue energy-saving approaches leading to a lower utilization of energy inputs. This evidence is related to Bloom et al. (2010), who find that good managerial practices improve energy efficiency. The second argument builds on the association between education and civic engagement (Dee, 2004, Milligan et al., 2004), which suggests that highly educated CEOs may embrace a universalistic managerial style characterized by greater awareness of environmental priorities and better alignment between corporate and societal goals. Both of these arguments propose that more educated CEOs achieve superior environmental performance; however, the first argument implies that the effect arises from managerial skills (and is thus largely specific to some fields of study) whereas according to the second the effect stems from the level of cumulated education. Separating out these explanations empirically is difficult. We address this challenge by comparing CEOs' educational attainment across different fields of study. Our results indicate that energy efficiency mainly arises by holding advanced degrees in business–related disciplines.====We move to study the individual actions behind our results so far. Recent evidence suggests that CEOs tend to bring their own personal beliefs into corporate decision-making (Cronqvist et al., 2012). Accordingly, we posit that CEO education may be positively associated with personal awareness of climate change. Our results indicate that highly educated CEOs are significantly more concerned about climate change, as proxied by a survey-based measure of environmental concerns covering more than 5000 CEOs. This result holds controlling for confounding factors such as gender, age and income, as well as tackling endogeneity concerns by using parents' education as instrumental variables while controlling for parents' political and religious values (which may have had a direct effect on offspring's preferences toward the environment). Next, we establish the material implications of education on CEOs' personal choices by focusing on car purchase decisions, a topic currently under scrutiny (e.g. Yan and Eskeland, 2018) given that cars are an important driver of pollution with significant implications for health conditions (Knittel et al., 2016). Our results suggest that CEO education has a positive and significant effect on the decision to purchase fuel-efficient cars, as measured by: (1) greater kilometer per liter of fuel, and (2) greater likelihood of owning an electric car. These findings too hold controlling for CEO income and other personal characteristics including age, gender and area of residence.====Our paper offers novel insights to the underexplored relationship between the educational level of top executives and the environmental footprint of the organizations they lead. The seminal study by Bertrand and Schoar (2003) provided early evidence on the presence of managerial styles.==== Recent works show that the impact of managerial styles on firm performance is stronger for highly educated CEOs (Bennedsen et al., 2018). Companies led by CEOs with better educational credentials achieve greater financial performance (Falato et al., 2015, King et al., 2016, Miller et al., 2015), while companies led by executives with science-related degrees engage in more R&D spending (Barker and Mueller, 2002, Scherer and Huh, 1992). By bridging the literature on managerial traits (e.g. Bertrand and Schoar, 2003, Malmendier and Tate, 2005, Malmendier and Tate, 2008) with that on the determinants of firms' environmental efficiency (e.g. Bloom et al., 2010, Popp, 2002, Martin et al., 2012), our study provides important contributions to the debate on why some firms pollute more than others (Shapira and Zingales, 2017). Corporate environmental actions are shaped by a complex set of firm-level and external determinants including a country's legal framework (Liang and Renneboog, 2017), industry competition (Fernandez-Kranz and Santaló, 2010), energy price and policies (e.g. Popp, 2002, Nesta et al., 2014), organization and management practices (Bloom et al., 2010, Boyd and Curtis, 2014, Martin et al., 2012) and corporate governance (Amore and Bennedsen, 2016, Ferrell et al., 2016, Kock et al., 2012). This web of determinants induces a substantial heterogeneity in energy efficiency, which may even exceed the heterogeneity found in traditional productivity measures (Lyubich et al., 2018). Our contribution to this debate is to empirically show that the environmentally-conscious management style of educated CEOs has a positive effect on a firm's energy efficiency.====Our research has relevant implications along three directions. First, from the business perspective, energy consumption can represent a significant production cost, and our study suggests that CEO education is a managerial trait that provides relevant variations of such costs. Second, a growing research documents that socially-responsible actions may have significant implications for shareholder value (e.g. Deng et al., 2015; Kruger, 2015, Flammer, 2015, Servaes and Tamayo, 2013), for instance because investment in corporate social responsibility facilitates the access to debt financing (Amiraslani et al., 2017) or because investors are sin averse due to social norms (Hong and Kacperczyk, 2009). We argue that education shapes managerial styles in a way that may be beneficial not just for shareholders, as the previous literature has suggested, but also for the environment. Third, understanding what drives firms to produce more efficiently can help policy-makers design effective environmental policies which take into account not only traditional factors such as production inputs or industry specialization but also the demographic traits and human capital of top executives.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data and shows the main summary statistics. Section 3 illustrates the relationship between CEO education and corporate energy efficiency and discusses our econometric strategies.

Early analysis focused on cross-sector comparative advantage. More recent investigation has explored the role of within-sector adjustments due to firm's heterogeneous responses to trade policy changes. This paper develops a model that brings these two approaches together, treating them as complementary rather than competing explanations, to provide insights into the complex ways that trade liberalization can drive environmental outcomes when the effects vary and interact within and across sectors.====To investigate the importance of these interactions this paper extends a two-sector trade and environment model, by incorporating heterogeneous firms and fixed costs. The resulting model, which I refer to as the “combined framework,” incorporates elements from a trade and environment framework developed by Copeland and Taylor (2003) as well as a two-sector heterogeneous-firm model developed by Bernard et al. (2007b) in order to link firm-level decisions to aggregate environmental outcomes. The model provides a tractable framework in which to evaluate the complex effects of trade or environmental policy changes. In particular, the model shows how trade and environmental policy changes and differences in cross-country factor allocations influence both cross-sector resource movement, driven by a country's comparative advantage, and within-sector increases in productivity, driven by cross-firm competition and reallocation, which can interact to affect environmental outcomes.====The combined framework identifies environmental effects of a trade liberalization working, simultaneously, through three main channels identified in related literature: changes due to overall economic output (a scale effect), changes due to cross-sector shifts in economic activity (a composition effect), and changes in within-sector emissions intensity (a technique effect). Importantly, the model demonstrates how, in contrast to a representative-firm model, the heterogeneous responses of firms, as competition generates endogenous reallocation of resources towards more productive firms, can lead to productivity gains that spillover into reductions in aggregate emissions intensity and also reductions in the degree of cross-sector resource movement. Both of these effects serve to dampen emissions increases for countries holding a comparative advantage in emissions intense production, even when the relative stringency of environmental policy is unchanged.====Long-running concern regarding the environmental effects of trade has generally been divided into two areas: that trade liberalization would drive pollution to lightly regulated countries (a pollution haven hypothesis), and an alternative concern that pollution might concentrate in capital intense regions or countries (a factor-endowment hypothesis). While initial investigations of the pollution haven hypothesis found little evidence to support the hypothesis, more recent work using panel data, both within and across countries (see Greenstone (2002); Hanna (2004); Ederington et al. (2005); Levinson and Taylor (2008)), has found statistically significant evidence of these effects.==== Work by Antweiler et al. (2001) emphasized that, by influencing costs of production, environmental regulation could affect a country's comparative advantage in addition to driving firms to increase abatement and lower their emissions intensity. Their work, and several related studies investigating the relative importance of the scale, composition, and technique channels using various decomposition methods (Levinson, 2009; Grether et al., 2009; Levinson, 2015; Brunel, 2017; Shapiro and Walker, 2017) have generally identified a strong technique effect as the primary channel driving aggregate emissions reductions.==== In addition, these studies have generally found that a trade-induced composition-effect appears to be of relatively little importance in explaining changes in total emissions.====While empirical decompositions of aggregate environmental trends have provided substantial evidence of the relative importance of both within and across sector channels in driving environmental outcomes, they tend to mask underlying micro-mechanisms that may influence one or both channels. In light of this concern Shapiro and Walker (2017) and Kreickemeier and Richter (2013) both develop models, investigating the environmental effects of trade, that incorporate heterogeneous firms, but abstract away from the cross-sector role endowments or environmental policy, and thus ignore the role of comparative advantage. Shapiro and Walker (2017) extend their model with significant empirical investigation but find little evidence of any environmental trade effect, arguing that the decline in U.S. manufacturing emissions they find is consistent with a doubling of environmental compliance costs from 1990 to 2008.====Other recent work, however, calls into question this conclusion–of a generally limited environmental effect of trade and, more specifically, a limited environmental role of cross-sector comparative advantage. For example, cross-country work by Frankel and Rose (2005) finds that increased trade tends to reduce air pollution across several measured pollutants, while similar work by Managi et al. (2009) shows that these effects differ across developing and non-developing countries. Using plant-level data, Cherniwchan (2017) shows that trade liberalization embodied in NAFTA, and the following competitive response of firms, resulted in substantial within-plant reductions in emissions intensity that varied across industries, sufficient to explain two-thirds of the reductions via the technique effect documented by Levinson (2009). Barrows and Ollivier (2016) find that market forces working through cross-sector and cross-firm reallocation substantially reduce CO2 emissions and emissions intensity among Indian firms, even in the absence of direct environmental regulation. Their results indicate that composition effects are similar in magnitude to technique effects. Broner et al. (2012) make use of a 30 year panel covering 101 countries to uncover evidence that environmental regulation is an important, and causal, source of comparative advantage for countries. Additional firm-level studies show that exporting firms tend to exhibit lower emissions intensity (Holladay, 2016; Forslid et al., 2015; Richter and Schiersch, 2017) and that trade liberalization drives down ambient pollution as firms respond to the market changes (Gutierrez and Teshima, 2017). Martin (2011), examining the environmental effects of falling trade barriers in India, finds that trade liberalization is associated with reallocation of output towards cleaner firms and substantial reduction in firm's emissions intensities, while Bombardini and Li (2016) find that recent trade liberalizations have led to increased emissions by exporting firms specializing in dirty sectors in China.====Together these studies indicate that trade liberalization can generate substantial environmental effects but that these effects vary by country, are influenced by environmental policy and other factors affecting cross-sector comparative advantage, and that the heterogeneous responses of firms to trade liberalization can generate substantial environmental effects.====This empirical evidence suggests a complex and nuanced role of trade in environmental outcomes and motivates the development of the combined framework. As in Bernard et al. (2007b), consideration of the asymmetric export opportunities afforded by comparative advantage in the current paper is key to understanding the implications of trade liberalization for environmental outcomes. As countries lower their trade barriers, the value of exporting rises and drives a competitive response among firms that drives an endogenous rise in productivity. This response is more pronounced in the comparative advantage industries because firms' export opportunities are greatest in those industries. With this asymmetric outcome at work across sectors, the combined framework yields several pertinent results.====First, in comparison to a representative-firm framework, where fixed technology and productivity parameters mean that a country's production possibility frontier is fixed, systematic reallocation of inputs and market share across firms that differ in their productivity levels will generate an endogenous rise in productivity. This productivity gain generates additional increases in output (a larger scale effect), endogenous decreases in emissions intensity (a technique effect) even when rigid environmental policy targets firms' emissions intensities, and a smaller composition effect. Work by Antweiler et al. (2001) and Cole and Elliott (2003) finds “surprisingly small” composition effects, relative to larger scale and technique effects associated with trade liberalization. In their approach, response to increased stringency of environmental policy, a within-firm reduction in emissions intensity, is the only mechanism driving the technique effect. The combined framework shows how the simultaneous consideration of endogenous reallocation of resources between firms may help to identify additional important environmental effects of a trade liberalization. In particular showing that even when trade may only induce a small composition effect (due to similarities in the trading partner's comparative advantage), trade liberalization still generates large scale and technique effects due to systematic reallocation of resources between heterogeneous firms.====Analytical approaches that attribute all reductions in aggregate emissions intensity (the environmental technique effect) to environmental regulation may miss reductions due to across-firm reallocation or within-firm technology upgrading motivated by trade policy changes and thus may be underestimating the environmental effects of trade policy. A similar point is highlighted by the findings of significant trade-induced within-plant reductions in emissions intensity by Cherniwchan (2017) and substantial cross-firm reallocation found by Barrows and Ollivier (2018), as well as the single-sector, heterogeneous-firm model developed by Kreickemeier and Richter (2013). However, trade-liberalization in single-sector models with neutral productivity–in which each firm's choice of relative factor shares depends on factor prices but not their specific productivity level–generally will not generate changes in factor allocations and usage, thus leaving total emissions unchanged as well.==== In this case, similar to the key outcome in Melitz (2003), increased trade can lead to reallocation of factors to more productive firms and thereby to endogenous productivity growth, in turn raising output and lowering emissions intensity, but leaves total labor allocations and, thus total emissions, unchanged.==== This leads to the second contribution of the combined framework.====By including multiple sectors and inputs, the combined framework admits a mechanism through which a trade-liberalization induces changes in a sector's factor usage, thereby leading to endogenous changes in total emissions driven by a country's comparative advantage. In addition, the combined framework shows that the interaction affects of cross-country comparative advantage with cross-firm reallocation rise with the country's comparative advantage. This is particularly relevant for the environmental composition effect, which is key to determining the sign of a trade liberalization's effect on the environment. In the combined framework, the heterogeneous responses of firms and resulting endogenous rise in productivity serves to moderate the movement of resources across sectors, thereby dampening the composition effect of trade and thus suggesting another challenge for empirical identification of this channel. Furthermore, in the combined framework, in contrast to the homogeneous firm approach of Copeland and Taylor (2003), aggregate productivity, and consequently a country's production possibilities frontier, is no longer fixed. By magnifying a country's output and moderating cross-sector resource movements, the combined framework shows that a country's trade-induced composition effect does not necessarily dominate the scale effect. Making inferences from a combined scale plus composition effect of trade may lead to incorrect conclusions about a country's comparative advantage and the environmental effects of trade.====Finally, the combined framework can be simulated, thus allowing for clear ==== insights into the environmental effects of various shocks to trade costs, environmental policy, or relative endowments. Taking parameter values from related literature, the simulation exercise shows that the combined framework is able to precisely recover the aggregate scale, composition, and technique effects estimated by Levinson (2009). The exercise also demonstrates how changes to trade and environmental policy, as well as changes to relative endowments, work together to influence each of the three effects. These results indicate that trade liberalization and increased environmental policy and relative expansion of factors, favoring relatively-clean production, are all required to obtain the actual outcomes estimated by Levinson (2009). This exercise further reveals that while trade liberalization is generating a relatively small composition effect, it is simultaneously driving significant output expansion, captured by the scale effect, and driving roughly one-third of the negative technique effect. In addition, when considering relative-factor expansion generating the observed composition effect, and the endogenous reductions in emissions intensity due to reallocation, the combined framework indicates that a simultaneous 20 percent increase in environmental stringency (measured by an implicit environmental tax) is needed to generate the observed reduction in emissions.====The general equilibrium framework that generates these particular results provides a rich and also tractable setting for analyzing environmental implications of both trade and environmental policy changes. Work by Romalis (2004) and Schott (2003) indicates that cross-country differences in factor allocation, as well as changes in factor expansion overtime continue to be important drivers of cross-country trade and production patterns. On the other hand, Bernard et al. (2007b) note that “recent research reveals that the poor empirical performance of neoclassical trade theory is driven by forces not captured in the standard Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek model, including the existence of trade costs, factor price inequality, and variation in technology and productivity across countries.” Two lines of existing research have shown that both across and within sector reallocation of resources are important channels influencing trade and output patterns. The omission of one or the other of these channels may be inhibiting investigation into the environmental effects of trade. The combined framework developed here brings these factors together, and highlights their importance for empirical investigation and policy evaluation.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 develops the model. Section 3 describes firm and aggregate emissions demands and section 4 discusses integrated and free trade equilibria.

A large body of literature uses the hedonic framework to recover the economic value of air quality improvements. A meta-analysis of 37 hedonic price studies found that the willingness to pay for air quality varied widely in the U.S., some even having a “perverse” sign that is inconsistent with prior expectations (Smith and Huang, 1995).====Three econometric identification problems could plague the implementation of the conventional hedonic model, especially in the developing country context. First, the hedonic model assumes that households are freely mobile across locations, but the costs associated with migration are high in developing countries. When there are significant migration costs, the benefits that households receive from moving to less polluted cities must compensate them not only for lower income and higher housing prices, but also for these costs. Therefore, the simple variation in income and housing costs across locations no longer reflects the economic value of differences in air quality (Bayer et al., 2009).====Second, the hedonic model assumes that households are free to select an amenity bundle from a continuous joint distribution of local attributes, but the spatial distribution of amenities is discrete and may contain many “holes”. When the spatial distribution of at least one amenity is discrete, there is no longer a direct link between the marginal price and the marginal willingness to pay (Kuminoff et al., 2013); this problem may be particularly important when amenities are discrete and heavily imbalanced across locations, which is often the case in developing countries.====Third, air pollution is likely to be correlated with unobservable local variables that affect both housing costs and household income. In most developing countries, economic development, job opportunities, government provision of public services, and polluting industries are all centralized in the same areas, which results in a more serious omitted variable problem in the estimation of hedonic prices for environmental amenities. Any of these three identification problems will lead to biased estimates of the marginal willingness to pay for clean air.====Billions of residents of developing countries face excessively high levels of air pollution, and this air pollution endangers their physical and economic health. However, the few existing studies in developing countries find that households' willingness to pay for improvements to environmental quality is extremely low (Yusuf and Resosudarmo, 2009; Kremer et al., 2011; Ito and Zhang, 2016). The paradox of a heavy economic and health burden generated by severe pollution and households' low valuation of environmental quality improvements in developing countries is the central puzzle at the intersection of environmental and development economics (Greenstone and Jack, 2015). China is the largest developing country and second largest economy in the world, and its air pollution problems pose extraordinary local and global challenges. However, data limitations have led to very few studies measuring the economic value of air quality improvements in China.====China provides a good setting in which to study households' sorting decisions while incorporating the disutility from migration. Estimates derived from these decisions can be used to evaluate willingness to pay for local amenities. The incomplete discrimination of ==== (the Chinese household registration system) argues against the benchmark assumption of free mobility in the conventional hedonic framework. Migrants without a local ==== do not have equal access to government-provided amenities – e.g., public education for kids and medical care service. There is also tremendous heterogeneity in the application of the ==== system across cities.==== Although moving costs are high in China, the total stock of migrants is estimated to be about 247 million in 2015, as large as 77% of the U.S. population.====In sorting across labor and housing markets, Chinese residents express growing concerns over the quality of the environment and its impact on their health. Fig. 1 relates air pollution of ==== location and the fraction of the population who leave their ==== city. It shows evidence in raw data that people have fled their ==== city to avoid the harmful exposure to severe air pollution; preferences for clean air shape the way that households sort across cities. China therefore provides a great opportunity for the study of pollution induced sorting and the important role played by migration costs.====We develop a two-step framework to recover household preferences for air quality. At its heart is a discrete-choice model of household residential location decisions, incorporating migration disutility. This empirical model follows Bayer et al. (2009), who estimate the economic value of air quality improvement in U.S. metro areas; in contrast, we employ different approaches to model migration disutility and different instruments to deal with endogeneity. First, we use a discrete-choice model with moving disutility to return the indirect utilities associated with residing in various cities. In order to model moving disutility in China, we not only consider the physical and psychological costs of living far from one's ==== location, but also heterogeneities in the barrier to obtain local ==== and economic opportunities available for migrants across Chinese cities. After getting city-specific mean utilities from the first-stage estimation, we regress them on measures of local air pollution in order to quantify the marginal willingness to pay for clean air. Because air pollution is likely to be correlated with unobserved aspects of city quality, an endogeneity problem arises in the second-stage estimation. Hence naïve OLS estimates of willingness to pay will be biased.====We employ two instrumental variables to address the endogeneity of the air pollution concentration of a given city: the smallest angle between the local annual prevailing wind direction and large-scale thermal power plants outside the city, along with the total annual coal consumption of the large-scale thermal power plants located upwind of the city.==== The wind will blow the particulate matter spewed from distant coal-fired power plants into the city, and these pollutants can dramatically worsen local air quality. The two instrumental variables provide an exogenous source of variation for a number of reasons. First, wind direction is stable over long periods of time, and it is exogenous to local economic activity. Second, those large-scale thermal power plants supply electricity to vast areas of China, including many remote regions; many do not supply electricity at all to their nearby cities, but rather to many remote provinces. Further, the allocation of electricity supply from large-scale power plants is determined by the central government – it is difficult for local governments to exert influence on the allocation of electricity supply from these power plants. Finally, the spillover from distant large-scale power plants on local economic activity is extremely small, but the pollutants emitted from power plants located upwind severely contaminate the local air.====Our study is conducted with the most comprehensive and detailed data available on city level air pollution and household level internal migration in China. Existing studies of air pollution in China typically use the Air Pollution Index (API) and PM10 data from the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China. However, API and PM10 data can only be obtained in large and medium-sized cities in China, and PM2.5 data were not published until 2014. Additionally, there is a potential concern that the official air quality data may be manipulated by local governments (Chen et al., 2012; Ghanem and Zhang, 2014). We collect city level annual average PM2.5 using Global Annual PM2.5 Grids derived from satellite data by Van Donkelaar et al. (2016). These data provide a reliable and accurate measurement of air quality for all cities in China.====Internal migration data are drawn from the 2005 One-Percent Population Census of China, which is a restricted access census data set collected by National Bureau of Statistics of China. It is the only national census data that records income in China. For each household, this dataset provides four-digit codes of city level ==== location and residential location, along with a wide range of sociodemographic and housing characteristic variables.====Our results reveal salient differences between the conclusions of the conventional hedonic framework and those of the residential sorting framework. They also demonstrate the importance of dealing with endogeneity as well as accounting for migration disutility and the discreteness of the choice set. To compare these two methodologies, we begin with a conventional hedonic analysis that recovers a negative estimate of the value of cleaner air. Instrumenting for air pollution is found to reduce the bias of hedonic estimates. Consistent with intuition, the MWTP for air quality has an expected positive sign when the sorting process and migration disutility are taken into account. Specifically, we find that the median Chinese household would pay about $21.70 for a one-unit reduction in annual average fine particulate matter concentration. Given 407 million households in China in 2005, the economic value of air quality improvement associated with a one-unit decline in PM2.5 concentration is approximately $8.83 billion. Our estimated willingness to pay for air quality is substantially larger than that found in existing studies on the economic value of a clean environment in developing countries. Furthermore, the results indicate that ignoring the discreteness of the choice set and migration disutility will likely misrepresent the economic benefits of environmental quality improvement in developing countries.",Willingness to pay for clean air in China,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069617308902,March 2019,2019,Research Article,323.0

Adults experienced one additional high-temperature day during ==== period, on average, attain 0.02 fewer years of schooling, increase the risk of illiteracy by 0.18%, achieve lower standardized word-test score by 0.48%, and are shorter by 0.02 cm. The impacts are greater in the first and second trimesters. Additionally, we find that income effects represent one important channel to explain the adverse effects of hot weather. Back-of-the-envelope predictions suggest that by the end of the 21st century, a 0.14–0.54 reduction in years of education and a 0.21–0.84 cm reduction in height is likely to result from climate change, ceteris paribus.","A growing literature in economics reveals that hot weather during pregnancy causes negative effects on birth outcomes.==== An important question that this evidence raises is whether such adverse effects on the birth outcomes further impact adult welfare, and if so, to what extent. Therefore, this study examines the effects of high temperatures on educational attainment and height of Chinese individuals born in rural areas between 1950 and 1994.====The evaluation of the adverse impacts of hot weather is highly relevant in China and other developing countries, which are dominated by rural residents, for two important reasons. First, people in developing countries, especially in rural areas, have limited access to avoidance behaviors to high temperatures such as air conditioning (Brooks et al., 2005; Feng et al., 2010). Specifically, only 12% of the 689 million rural residents in China owned air conditioning units in 2009 (====). In contrast, around 87% of the households in the United States were equipped with at least one air conditioning unit in 2009 (====). The limited access to thermal avoidance behaviors may amplify the impacts of high temperatures in the developing world. Second, high temperatures negatively affect crop yields, which represent the main sources of income for rural households. Thus, rural pregnant women might be more vulnerable to high temperatures than their urban counterparts due to the related negative income effects (Schlenker and Roberts, 2009).====According to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the average global temperature at the end of the 21st century are expected to be higher than the levels recorded in the year 2000 by 0.5–8.6 °F (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2013). This increase is mainly due to greenhouse gas emissions. Fig. 1 contrasts the daily maximum near-surface air temperature on July 1st of the years 2000 (panel a) and 2100 (panel b) across the world. It shows that the predicted high temperatures can exceed 310 K (around 98 °F) in some places such as China, the Arabian Peninsula, North Africa, and the USA in 2100 if greenhouse gas emissions are not controlled. Thus, the estimation of the costs related to climate change is extremely important to enable policy makers to design effective climate-change-mitigation policies.====To study the effects of hot weather during pregnancy on adult outcomes, we combine individual information from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) with weather information from the China Meteorological Administration and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).==== Exploiting information on the date and place of birth of each individual, we are able to measure the weather conditions during his/her prenatal period. We estimate a model controlling for individual characteristics and a rich set of fixed effects. Our identification relies on plausibly random variations in the temperature distribution for a given county and calendar month.====We find that hot weather during pregnancy triggers significant reductions in adult welfare in multiple dimensions. Specifically, adults who experienced an additional day of high temperature during their prenatal periods, on average, attain 0.02 fewer years of schooling and have a higher risk of illiteracy by 0.18%. Furthermore, these adults show a 0.48% decrease in standardized word-test scores and are shorter by 0.02 cm. The impacts also appear to be concentrated in the first and second trimesters. The effects of high temperatures are not statistically significant in the third trimester.====To the best of our knowledge, such long-term effects on human capital development have not been taken into account in the calculation of the costs of global warming. In the current study, we perform back-of-the-envelope predictions for adult outcomes of individuals who will be born in the rural areas of China in 2100 based on the climate projections provided by the NASA. Compared to those born in 2000, ceteris paribus, individuals who will be born at the end of the 21st century will attain 0.14–0.54 fewer education years and will be shorter by 0.21–0.84 cm.====We propose three hypotheses that may explain why hot weather affects birth outcomes: biological effects, behavioral effects, and income effects. First, pregnant women are more susceptible to ambient heat stress due to the extra physical strain associated with pregnancy. Hence, high temperatures play an important role in determining the fetal size and development by influencing the physical health conditions of pregnant women (see Strand et al. (2011) for a comprehensive review).==== We refer to these as biological effects. Second, hot weather may induce changes in the daily activities of pregnant women and further affect the birth outcomes. For instance, Herman (1993) documents that ambient heat could reduce appetite and alter food selection, which are critical factors for fetal development (Figlio et al., 2009). We refer to these as behavioral effects. Third, high temperatures affect household resources and nutrition for pregnant women by altering the crop yields, which represent the main source of income in rural areas, and thus impact the health conditions of newborns.==== We refer to these as income effects.====In this study, we test the existence of income effects by exploiting the variation of the crops sensitivity to heat. We find statistically significant evidence that areas with high proportions of heat-tolerant crops (corn and sugarcane) mitigate the adverse effects of high temperatures during pregnancy. Specifically, when the proportion of heat-tolerant crops reaches about 30%, the adverse effects of hot weather during pregnancy are muted. This evidence suggests that the effects of high temperatures on crop output, and consequently on household income, most likely offer an important explanation for our findings. On the other hand, the existence of biological or behavioral effects cannot be completely ruled out since our data do not include information on the activities of the individuals during pregnancy.====Our paper contributes to the literature in several ways. Deschenes et al. (2009) find that exposure to high temperatures during pregnancy has a modestly negative effect on birth weight. But whether the effect is further related to adult outcomes remains an important but unanswered question. To our knowledge, three papers by Isen et al. (2017), Wilde et al. (2017), and Fishman et al. (2018) study the long-term persistent effects of high temperatures during the prenatal period on adult outcomes. Wilde et al. (2017) show that individuals in sub-Saharan Africa conceived during high temperatures have higher educational attainment and literacy due to fetal selection. Isen et al. (2017) employ U.S. data and find that hot weather during pregnancy reduces annual income but does not affect educational attainment. The study of Fishman et al. (2018) shows that 1 °C increase in the average temperature during pregnancy reduces both income and education attainment in Ecuador.====In comparison, our study, using China as a developing country context, shows that educational attainment of adults is negatively affected by the ==== exposure to high temperatures. In addition to educational attainment, our study examines the effects of high temperatures on physical conditions (height) and advances a detailed discussion of the mechanisms that may explain why hot weather during ==== period affects adult welfare. Our findings demonstrate that adverse income changes resulting from hot weather are among the key factor impacting welfare. Our estimates may also offer good external validity to other developing countries. This is because the adverse effects of high temperatures during pregnancy might be highly dependent on the thermal avoidance behaviors and household income sources. Avoidance behaviors can be more costly in the developing world due to the lower quality of housing stock and the more difficult access to air conditioning. Additionally, crop yields as the main source of income in major areas of developing countries could be negatively affected by hot weather. Thus, pregnant women in rural areas might be more vulnerable to high temperatures than the ones in urban areas due to such effects on income.====Second, this paper contributes to a growing literature investigating the relationships between early-life conditions and later-life outcomes (see Currie and Almond (2011) for a comprehensive review). Several influential studies have examined the consequences of early-life shocks, such as the influenza pandemic (Almond, 2006), the Chernobyl disaster (Almond et al., 2009), famine (Chen and Zhou, 2007), and hurricanes (Currie and Rossin-Slater, 2013). These studies reveal that such shocks have persistent and profound effects on well-being in later life. Nevertheless, the unusual nature of these events raises concern about their generalizability to other early-life shocks (Maccini and Yang, 2009; Almond and Mazumder, 2011). Recent investigations have probed the effects of more typical events in early life, such as rainfall (Maccini and Yang, 2009), alcohol availability (Nilsson, 2017), and diet restriction associated with Ramadan fasting (Almond and Mazumder, 2011). We aim to complement this strand of literature by exploring the effects of high temperatures during pregnancy as another typical variation in early-life conditions on later-life outcomes.====Lastly, from a broader perspective, our findings may add to the literature that explains the positive correlation between latitude and economic development. Many scholars have found convincing evidence that economic activities are indirectly correlated with geography through historical channels (see Wacziarg and Spolaore, 2013 for a review). However, some studies provide alternative direct explanations for such phenomena, such as the high burden of disease in addition to the pests and parasites that thrive in hot climates. Based on our findings, we provide another potential explanation: high temperatures affect the newborn endowment, and consequently human capital, which are crucial for economic development.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes our data and definitions of the variables. Section 3 introduces the econometric approach. Section 4 presents the main findings. Section 5 discusses the possible channels behind the impacts, implements robustness checks, and predicts the effects of global warming.

We introduce a class of mechanisms in the form of two-stage games in which agents first announce consumption levels and then bargain over monetary compensations. The defining characteristic of a mechanism is the way it assigns bargaining power to agents as a consequence of their locations, inflows, and consumption decisions. We first determine which mechanisms give incentives to always allocate the water efficiently, in the sense that, regardless of the agents' benefit functions, equilibrium play always yields an efficient outcome. Among these, we take an axiomatic approach to single out three mechanisms that guarantee a fair division of the welfare gain obtained through cooperation along the river.","Water scarcity is a major challenge of ever-increasing importance. Globally, water demand steadily increases due to population and economic growth while water supply decreases and fluctuates more as a consequence of climate change (Ambec et al., 2013). Water law is often too vague to solve river conflicts, leaving plenty of room for decentralized negotiations between involved regions or states aimed at obtaining welfare gains from integrated water resource management (see e.g. Ambec and Sprumont, 2002; Salman, 2007). A common reason for conflict is that inflows are often high for upstream countries while the use or need of water is high for downstream countries. This leads downstream countries to claim historic rights to water while upstream countries cite principles of territorial sovereignty and claim the right to use “their own” water resources. In this paper, we contribute to the already extensive literature on river sharing by putting a new emphasis on decentralized solutions through multilateral bargaining.====Ambec and Sprumont (2002) along with several subsequent studies (e.g. Ambec et al., 2013; van den Brink et al., 2012) approach the river sharing problem as a cooperative game. This is a natural way to model coordination and competition among players and coalitions, but it relies on two assumptions that we will depart from. Specifically, it takes as a given that water is allocated optimally and that the gains of cooperation are shared according to principles of cooperative game theory. While these principles are well-founded, they still imply that all decisions are taken out of the hands of the agents (that is, the countries or regions involved in the conflict). Essentially, it is as if a central planner or mediator is asked and has the authority to settle the river dispute in its entirety. In this paper, we retain the objectives, to use water efficiently and share gains equitably, but seek a decentralized way of achieving them. By putting the consumption and gains-sharing decisions back into the hands of the agents, the river dispute is resolved without the involvement of a third party. Furthermore, while the solutions of cooperative game theory require the planner to have complete information on all aspects of the problem, the ones that we introduce rely only on publicly verifiable records. In this way, they operate without information on the benefit that the agents draw from water consumption and are thereby less demanding from an informational standpoint.====From a formal perspective, our approach necessitates several changes to the seminal model. Most importantly, we view the resolution process as a two-stage game. In the first stage, agents announce desired consumption levels. Typically, these will imply that water is transferred between agents in a way that allows for more efficient water use and increased total welfare. In the second stage, agents bargain over how to share the welfare gain. This is modelled as a stochastic process in which an agent is selected with a specific probability to make a proposal for the other agents to veto or accept. We analyze the two-stage game through backward induction and show first (Theorem 1) that the bargaining game in the second stage generally has a unique subgame-perfect equilibrium in stationary strategies. To discuss this result in detail and understand its effects on the game as a whole, we will first explain how the proposal probabilities are determined.====Formally, we say that an agent is ==== as the proposer with a certain probability, which in effect is a measure of the agent's bargaining power: the higher the recognition probability, the more likely it is that the agent gets to propose a solution to the river dispute. We discuss the factors that influence the recognition probabilities in the next paragraph. Throughout the paper, the term ==== refers to the distribution of the recognition probabilities and thus the division of power during the negotiations. From the perspective of the agents, the recognition function is exogenously given. In particular, its interpretation is that of a norm or convention that has been established over time. Intuitively, some recognition functions have higher potential of becoming the established norm, namely those that guarantee that the water is used efficiently and that the gains of water trade are shared equitably. Our main contribution is to give a precise description of the recognition functions that guarantee efficient water use (Theorem 2) and then to pinpoint three of these that imply a normatively compelling distribution of the welfare gain (Theorem 3, Theorem 4, Theorem 5).====There is a high degree of asymmetry between the agents which can only be adequately reflected by a very flexible bargaining protocol. In other words, a wide range of factors influence the recognition probabilities. For instance, the recognition function may account for water access: this depends on the agents' locations along the river, the local inflows, and the upstream consumption choices. Likewise, it may depend on how much water the agents consume or how much they transfer downstream (we return to these and their induced consumption incentives in the next paragraph). After all, creating gains from joint water management requires collaboration between high-inflow and high-consumption countries that is facilitated by intermediate transfer countries, and all are justified in claiming their fair share of the gain. Therefore, to capture the problem's intrinsic asymmetries, we maintain a large space of possible recognition functions that may depend on locations, inflows, and consumption decisions. For practical implementation, it is important that these are all publicly verifiable records. We will not allow more vague aspects, such as the benefit that an agent derives from water consumption, to impact the recognition probabilities.====While locations and inflows are fixed, agents choose consumption. This can have a distortive effect when recognition probabilities depend on consumption choices, as it may incentivize agents to use the water in an inefficient way. Returning to Theorem 1, the result shows that the welfare surplus is shared in proportion to the recognition probabilities in equilibrium. This reveals a potential trade-off in an agent's strategy: it is beneficial to announce an inefficient consumption level if this increases the agent's recognition probability relatively more than it decreases the welfare surplus. For instance, if we set probabilities in proportion to consumption, then agents will often have an incentive to consume more than what is efficient. Similarly, setting recognition probabilities in proportion to the amount of water transferred also fails to guarantee efficient water use. Hence, only some recognition functions ==== – for all vectors of inflows and profiles of benefit functions – result in efficient consumption in equilibrium. Theorem 2 makes this precise: for the game to always implement efficient outcomes, an agent's consumption choice can only affect the recognition probabilities of those downstream from the agent. In this way, the finding presents a twist on Holmstrom's (1982) famous result on cooperation in teams.====Theorem 2 still leaves open a wide range of mechanisms that ensure efficient water use. Among these, we take an axiomatic approach and follow the literature on fair allocation to identify three mechanisms that guarantee a fair division of the welfare gain. That is, we specify a set of compelling axioms that jointly lead to well-founded recognition functions. Focusing on recognition functions that are scalable in a consistent way, Theorems 3, 4, and 5 characterize three mechanisms that all ensure efficient water use in equilibrium. More specifically, Theorem 3 emphasizes the agents' relative location along the river and sets recognition probabilities following a geometric series. Moreover, Theorem 4 characterizes the aforementioned recognition function that sets probabilities in relation to water access, and Theorem 5 sets probabilities in proportion to inflows. In this way, we explore the full range of recognition functions, conditioning probabilities on locations, consumption, and inflows.====Compared to the seminal ==== solution (Ambec and Sprumont, 2002), our solutions yield intrinsically different outcomes. Most importantly, the outcome recommended by ==== depends directly on the agents' benefit from water consumption whereas our solutions, by construction, do not. Another difference relates to the scenario in which no water is transferred to or from an agent. To the best of our knowledge, no solutions in the literature award such an agent any share of the welfare gain. In contrast, Theorem 6 shows that there is no implementable recognition function that always excludes such an agent from sharing the welfare gain. We also contrast the solutions through simulations, showing that those we introduce divide the welfare gain in a more egalitarian way than ==== and its natural mirror image, ==== (van den Brink et al., 2007; Herings et al., 2007).====We acknowledge that there are other established solutions but restrict the comparisons to the incremental solutions. By now, there is a large literature on the river sharing problem with extensions to satiated preferences (Ambec and Ehlers, 2008b), multiple springs (Khmelnitskaya, 2010; van den Brink et al., 2012; Béal et al., 2015) and uncertain inflows (Ambec et al., 2013). Other solutions have been derived for instance through a market-based approach (Wang, 2011) or through strategic negotiations (Adams et al., 1996). For surveys of the literature, we refer to (Ambec and Ehlers, 2008a), Beal et al. (2013), and (Ansink et al., 2015). There are also closely related problems that take a slightly different approach: sharing the cost of cleaning a polluted river (Ni and Wang, 2007; Dong et al., 2012; Alcalde-Unzu et al., 2015; van den Brink et al., 2018), sharing irrigation costs (Aadland and Kolpin, 1998, 2004; Moulin, 2004), and river claims problems (Ansink and Weikard, 2012, 2015; Ansink et al., 2017) to which an axiomatic approach also is used. In contrast, the topic that we focus mainly on, implementation, has been less studied. The single exception is the working paper by Ambec and Sprumont (2000), which shows that ==== is implementable through a particular extensive-form game.====Our study is also connected to the literature on cooperative bargaining solutions to water allocation (Kilgour and Dinar, 2001; Dinar, 2001; Houba, 2008; Ansink and Weikard, 2009; Houba et al., 2014; Degefu et al., 2016). Our second stage is adapted from the literature on non-cooperative bargaining with a random proposer and draws on the work of Binmore et al. (1986), Binmore (Binmore et al., 1987), and Baron and Ferejohn (1989), among others. Equilibrium existence and uniqueness in such models is analyzed in Eraslan (2002) and Eraslan and McLennan (2013). In regards to contests (Tullock et al., 1980), several papers analyze ways to determine agents' bargaining power through contest success functions (see e.g. Rai and Sarin, 2009; Skaperdas, 1996; Yildirim, 2010). However, in this literature, the success an agent has typically depends on the agent's effort, whereas our recognition functions that implement efficient outcomes are independent of the agent's consumption.====We present the model in Section 2. In Section 3, we introduce the class of mechanisms, and we present our results on implementation in Section 4. In Section 5, we take an axiomatic approach to select from the implementable solutions. We contrast the new solutions with the incremental solutions in Section 6. Section 7 concludes. Appendix A contains additional technical remarks.

The growth rate of these inputs and the ","The substitutability of scarce environmental goods by manufactured goods is central to any cost-benefit analysis of environmental policies and to the notion of sustainability. In the late 17th century, the French administration expanded oak forests in the perspective of being able to build ships two centuries later to fight the British naval forces, long before realizing that oak would be substituted by steel. More recently, wars have been made to control oil fields before realizing that oil could well be substituted by non-conventional gas reserves and by renewable sources of energy in the near future. Optimistic futurists believe that the need for material goods and disappearing natural capital will be reduced or even eliminated by new technologies. Finally, the debate about the preservation of natural resources and biodiversity is made complex because of the uncertainty about whether these resources could be substituted by other non-natural inputs in the future.====Of course, our attitude towards the preservation of natural capital such as water, biodiversity, fossil fuels, climate or unspoiled natural sites is determined by the way we price it. But most natural assets generate ecological services that will persist for centuries, and deep uncertainties surround the valuation of these services by future generations. This implies that there is no consensus about how to value natural capital. For this reason, this notion remained up to now a metaphor rather than an instrument (Fenichel and Abbott (2014)). Guesnerie (2004), Hoel and Sterner (2007), Sterner and Persson (2008), Gollier (2010) and Traeger (2011) have stressed the role of the evolution of relative prices in discounting, and thus of the degree of substitutability between different inputs. In a growing economy, the relative scarcity of the non-substitutable non-expendable natural capital will increase over time, thereby raising their relative value for future generations. This relative price effect can be stronger than the discounting effect, so that the same ecosystem service delivered latter can have a larger present monetary value. This is particularly plausible for non-substitutable resources. In this paper, we re-examine this question in a context where the degree of substitutability of natural resources is uncertain.====Suppose that the single consumption good can be produced by combining the constant service of some natural capital with another input, for example some physical capital. Because we take consumption as the numeraire, it can also be interpreted as income. Suppose that the instantaneous monetary value of the ecosystem service has a constant income-elasticity ====. In our model, this property is derived from a CES production function with an elasticity of substitution ==== between the two inputs, as shown by Ebert (2003). In other words, the elasticity of substitution of natural capital is also the inverse of the consumption-elasticity of the value of the ecosystem services that this natural capital generates. If the elasticity of substitution is small, the consumption-elasticity is large. In a growing economy, this implies a large relative price effect that dampens the effect of discounting. To illustrate, suppose that the physical capital will grow in the future so that consumption is expected to be multiplied by a factor 10 within the next century. If the income-elasticity of the value of ecosystem services is equal to unity, the instantaneous value of ecosystem services will also be multiplied by a factor 10 within the next century. Suppose alternatively that we are unsure about the degree of substitutability, so that the income-elasticity of the value of ecosystem services is either 0 (infinite substitutability) or 2 (weak substitutability) with equal probabilities. In that context, the value of ecosystem services in 100 years will be either stable, or it will be increased by a factor 100. In expectation, the value of ecological services will be increased by a factor 50. Discounted to the present, this shows that the uncertainty affecting the degree of substitution magnifies the value of the natural asset. In this example, the uncertainty surrounding the substitutability of a natural asset raises its social value by a factor 5. In short, the uncertainty surrounding the elasticity of substitution of ecosystem services magnifies the relative price effect in the valuation of natural capital.====However, this simple observation should be reconsidered once one recognizes that the growth rate of the consumption is also uncertain. As is well-known in the Consumption-based Capital Asset Pricing Model (CCAPM), the income-elasticity of the flow of dividends of an asset is also its CCAPM beta, which determines its risk-adjusted discount rate, or expected rate of return, for this asset. An asset with a large income-elasticity concentrates most of its risky benefits in the good states, and provides smaller benefits in the bad states. This justifies penalizing this asset by using a large rate to discount future expected benefits. Under the CCAPM, this risk-adjusted discount rate is linearly increasing in the CCAPM beta, i.e., in ====. This means that the uncertainty affecting this substitutability parameter has a discounting effect on top of the relative price effect described above. The main result of this paper is that the relative price effect always dominates the discounting effect, so that any mean-preserving increase in the substitutability parameter ==== always reduces the ecological discount rate, i.e. the rate at which a sure increase in ecosystem service should be discounted. In other words, the uncertainty surrounding the substitutability of natural capital always increases its value. This is in line with the precautionary principle, a general rule favouring the preservation of natural assets in the face of uncertainty.====These new findings are related to some results in the finance literature. Pastor and Veronesi (2003, 2009) show that the uncertainty affecting the growth rate of dividends of an asset increases its market value. In our model, the uncertainty affecting substitutability translates into an uncertain growth rate of natural dividends. But this risk is correlated with the systematic risk, whereas in Pastor and Veronesi (2003, 2009), an idiosyncratic risk is assumed, so that they are not concerned by the risk-adjusted discounting effect. This paper is also related to the literature on the impact on asset pricing of learning. Collin-Dufresne et al. (2016) examine the case of learning about the trend of economic growth or about the frequency of macroeconomic catastrophes. Jagannathan and Wang (1996), Lettau and Ludvigson (2001) and Adrian and Franzoni (2008) acknowledge that most assets’ betas vary stochastically, and that this uncertainty affects asset pricing. This research is also linked to the recent developments aimed at valuing very distant cash flows (Martin (2012); Barro and Misra (2012)). Using our findings, the high price documented by Giglio et al. (2015) and Giglio et al. (2018) for real estate claims maturing in 100 years and more in the United Kingdom and in Singapore could be due to the deep uncertainty affecting the correlation between aggregate consumption and the land rent in the distant future. Our model provides a new explanation for why assets generating benefits with an uncertain degree of substitutability with other goods and services are – or should be -- highly valued.====This paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we present a simple asset pricing model using a CES production function with two inputs. We specify this two-input CCAPM model by assuming a bivariate geometric Brownian motion for the growth of consumption and ecosystem services with constant relative risk aversion. We characterize the impact of uncertainty for the substitutability parameter in Section 4. In Section 5, we provide an analytical solution for the ecological discount rate when the distribution of the substitutability parameter is Gaussian. Because the CCAPM specification implies the well-known asset pricing puzzles, this model would generate pricing rules for natural capital that are inconsistent with the price of assets on financial markets. In order to resolve this serious limitation of the model, we follow an approach proposed by Barro (2006, 2009). In Section 6, we extend the CCAPM model by introducing the possibility of infrequent extreme macroeconomic catastrophes, and we obtain an analytical solution for the ecological discount rates that are coherent with market pricing. This model is calibrated to illustrate our results.",Valuation of natural capital under uncertain substitutability,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069617308197,March 2019,2019,Research Article,326.0

Climate change caused by carbon emissions from burning fossil fuel is a prominent case in point. The disappointing experience with the Kyoto Protocol and the tedious ongoing negotiations raise doubts whether an effective centralized solution can be secured. Hence, it is important to explore the welfare costs of decentralized policymaking. Such an analysis should take into account that apart from controlling transboundary pollution governments are engaged in various other fiscal policies, notably in taxing mobile capital at the source.====In a multi-country general equilibrium model we investigate how (in)effective national emissions taxes or emissions caps are in controlling pollution in a world economy with international trade in goods and factors and capital tax competition. Each country produces a final (consumption) good and an intermediate good. Capital is an input in the production of all goods, and the intermediate good is used along with capital to produce final goods.==== Pollution is positively correlated with the intermediate good. That pollution is transboundary including the polar cases of local and global pollution. For example, climate change is a global pollution problem that fits the structure of production, if we interpret the intermediate good as fossil fuel. An example for local pollution covered by our analytical framework is groundwater contamination through nitrates, if we consider the production structure of cattle breeding and interpret the intermediate good as fodder that is positively correlated with nitrate.====The principal focus of our paper is on strategic two-instrument policies that combine pollution control - either in the form of emissions taxes or emissions caps - with capital taxation. However, stand-alone policies of taxing capital, or emissions, or setting emissions caps are also worth studying because they are of interest in their own right and provide insights in the outcome of the two-instrument policies.====In the large literature on tax competition, governments are usually assumed to interact strategically in the sense that they account for the (non-negligible) impact of their tax policy on equilibrium prices and quantities.==== Our paper builds on the literature on emissions regulation and capital tax competition that introduced pollution into the workhorse model of capital tax competition of Zodrow and Mieszkowski (1986) and Wilson (1986). So far, this literature has assumed that a final good is produced with capital, and emissions are proportional to capital (Ogawa and Wildasin, 2009), or emissions are modeled ‘as if they are an input’ along with capital in the production of final goods==== (Oates and Schwab, 1988). Assuming that emissions are proportional to capital means that capital taxes and emissions taxes coincide. A possible interpretation of the input ‘emissions’ is to assume that final good production requires capital and a second physical resource that is costless and generates harmful emissions in proportion to its use. In contrast to Oates and Schwab (1988) and Ogawa and Wildasin (2009) we suppose that capital is a clean input and that there is a second factor of production that is dirty and costly.====Treating emissions as (if they are) an input, Oates and Schwab (1988) find in their seminal contribution that small countries refrain from taxing capital and set efficient emissions caps. Applying Oates and Schwab's (1998) modeling of emissions and the assumption of local pollution, Eichner and Pethig (2018) show that large asymmetric countries choose inefficient capital taxes and emissions caps. Kim and Wilson (1997) add to the analytical framework of Oates and Schwab a distortionary tax on residential labor and show that emissions caps are then inefficiently lax. In Ogawa and Wildasin's (2009) paper with ‘dirty’ mobile capital, small countries set emissions taxes efficiently, no matter whether pollution is local or transboundary. Taking up Ogawa and Wildasin's assumption of dirty capital, Eichner and Runkel (2012) point out that capital taxes are inefficiently low, when the capital supply is elastic rather than inelastic as in Ogawa and Wildasin (2009). Fell and Kaffine (2014) demonstrate that Ogawa and Wildasin's efficiency result depends on whether capital is retired or not.====The present paper not only deviates from the literature on pollution and capital taxation with respect to the modeling of emissions. Unlike Oates and Schwab (1988), we focus on transboundary pollution (with local pollution as a limiting case) and on ‘large’ symmetric countries that act strategically in the sense that they take into account the equilibrium repercussions of their policies. We share with Ogawa and Wildasin (2009), Eichner and Runkel (2012) and Fell and Kaffine (2014) the assumptions of transboundary pollution, but these studies==== focus on one-instrument policies, whereas we investigate strategic two-instrument policies.====To sharpen the focus on the environmental effects of pollution control and capital taxation, the above-mentioned literature (with the exception of Kim and Wilson (1997)) takes one of two routes. Either it assumes that lumpsum taxes are available to finance local public goods, in which case these goods are provided efficiently. Or it disregards local public goods and assumes instead that the revenue from taxation or permit sales are returned lumpsum to the residents. Since the relevant efficiency properties of both procedures are the same, we take the simpler route which is to abstract from the provision of local public goods.====The literature on capital tax competition without pollution produced the well-known ‘race-to-the-bottom’ result (Wilson and Wildasin, 2004), according to which each country undercuts the other countries' rates until all tax rates are zero. In our model with pollution, stand-alone capital tax competition yields this result only when pollution is global. Otherwise, capital tax rates are positive, but do not reduce emissions. Stand-alone pollution control via emissions taxes or cap-and-trade is efficient only, if pollution is local. When pollution is transboundary, emissions reduction is inefficiently low in both kinds of pollution control policies and emissions taxation is more inefficient than the cap-and-trade policy. The inefficiency of emissions taxation is in line with Eichner and Runkel (2012) but in contrast to Ogawa and Wildasin (2009) - keeping in mind that taxation of capital and emissions coincides in the two studies.====When combining capital taxation and pollution control, where the latter comes in the form of either cap-and-trade or emissions taxation, we find that these two-instrument policies are efficient when pollution is local. Oates and Schwab (1988) established efficiency of local pollution in the small-country case. Here we extend their efficiency result to large symmetric countries. Transboundary pollution turns out to be inefficiently high under both two-instrument policies. Interestingly, combining capital taxation with cap-and-trade yields the same outcome, in qualitative terms, as the stand-alone cap-and-trade policy: Countries refrain from taxing capital and hence the outcome is efficient [inefficient] if pollution is local [transboundary]. The combined taxation of capital and emissions is less inefficient than the stand-alone emissions tax policy, but more inefficient than the combination of capital taxation and cap-and-trade policy. Furthermore, in case of taxing capital and emissions the capital tax rate is zero [negative] in case of local [transboundary] pollution. We conclude that the policy of combining emissions caps with capital taxes is not equivalent to the policy of combining emissions taxes with capital taxes. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first that offers a comparison between emissions caps and emissions taxes when countries compete with respect to pollution control and capital taxes.====The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we specify the competitive world economy with exogenous policies and determine the comparative static effects of small changes in policy parameters. Section 2 then proceeds with characterizing the benchmark of efficient allocation and its decentralization by prices and policy parameters. Section 3 analyzes the (in)efficiency properties of decentralized strategic policymaking when countries use alternative one-instrument policies. Section 4 studies the (in)efficiency properties of decentralized policymaking when countries combine capital taxation with pollution control via emissions caps or emissions taxes. Section 5 provides a systematic comparison of these pollution control policies without and with capital taxation. In Section 6 we discuss how results vary when policy implementation is sequential, when firm ownership is international, and when the number of competing countries varies.

This article quantifies plastic leakage from the banning of plastic carryout bags. Using quasi-random policy variation in California, I find the elimination of 40 million pounds of plastic carryout bags is offset by a 12 million pound increase in trash bag purchases—with small, medium, and tall trash bag sales increasing by 120%, 64%, and 6%, respectively. The results further reveal 12–22% of plastic carryout bags were reused as trash bags pre-regulation and show bag bans shift consumers towards fewer but heavier bags. With a substantial proportion of carryout bags already reused in a way that avoided the manufacture and purchase of another plastic bag, policy evaluations that ignore leakage effects overstate the regulation's welfare gains.","Governments often regulate or tax the consumption of products with negative externalities (e.g., alcohol, tobacco, sugar, and gasoline). However, policies are not always complete in their coverage, applying to only a subset of jurisdictions or products contributing negative externalities. Leakage occurs when partial regulation directly results in increased consumption of these products in unregulated parts of the economy (Fowlie, 2009). If unregulated consumption is easily substituted for regulated consumption, basing the success of a regulation solely on reduced consumption in the regulated market overstates the regulation's welfare gains.====In this article, I quantify leakage from the regulation of plastic in consumer goods. The United Nations Environmental Program estimates that 10 to 20 million tonnes of plastic enters the world's oceans each year, costing $13 billion in environmental damage to marine ecosystems, including losses incurred by fisheries and tourism (UNEP, 2014). With growing concern about the costs of plastic waste, governments are turning to economic incentives and command-and-control regulations to curb the use of consumer plastics. An increasingly popular environmental policy has been the regulation of disposable carryout bags (DCB).==== Approximately 242 local governments in the U.S. adopted DCB policies between 2007 and 2016, across 20 states and the District of Columbia.==== Most DCB policies in the U.S. prohibit retail food stores from providing customers with thin plastic carryout bags at checkout and require stores to charge a minimum fee for paper and other reusable carryout bags. However, all remaining types of disposable bags are left unregulated (e.g., trash bags and waste bin liners). Given DCBs can be reused as trash bags before they are disposed,==== this article asks the empirical question: Do bans on plastic carryout bags cause consumers to increase their purchases of unregulated plastic trash bags?====The answer to this question is not only relevant for quantifying leakage; it also provides a key variable for evaluating the environmental effectiveness of DCB policies. Life-cycle assessments (LCAs)—studies that estimate a product's cradle-to-grave environmental impact—are used, and often required, by governments around the world in designing environmental legislation (Ehrenfeld, 1997; Rebitzer et al., 2004).==== LCAs of plastic, paper, and reusable carryout bags have been shown to be sensitive to assumptions made about the weight and number of trash bags displaced by the secondary use of plastic carryout bag, with the reuse of plastic carryout bags as bin liners substantially improving their environmental performance (Mattila et al., 2011). According to a UK Environmental Agency (2011) study, a shopper needs to reuse a cotton carryout bag 131 times to have the same global warming potential (measured in kilograms of CO2 equivalent) as plastic carryout bags with zero reuse, while that same cotton bag needs to be reused 327 times if all plastic carryout bags are reused as bin liners. Thus, a contribution of this paper is to provide an estimate for the ==== of plastic carryout bags that policymakers can use as a benchmark for calculating and interpreting LCA results.====Determining the causal relationship between regulations and leakage is challenging because one must construct a credible counterfactual for consumption in the absence of the regulation, both for regulated and unregulated goods. To understand the causal effect of DCB policies on regulated and unregulated bag consumption, I take advantage of quasi-random variation in local government DCB policy adoption in California—where 139 policies were implemented over nine years. Having more than one policy change over time allows me to separate the causal effect of the policies from other time-varying factors. The second challenge I address is that of limited data. I bring together two data sources: (i) weekly retail scanner data with store-level price and quantity information on trash bag sales, and (ii) observational transaction-level data collected in-store for the number and types of carryout bags used at checkout. Leakage, in this case, is quantified by comparing changes in trash bag sales (from the scanner data) to changes in carryout bag use (from the observational data). While data on trash bags sales are readily available to researchers in retail scanner datasets, such as the one used in this paper, transaction-level data on carryout bag use (for both bags obtained in the store and those brought from outside) are more challenging to obtain, due to their manual, time-consuming nature to collect.==== Thus, another contribution of this paper is the combination of scanner and observational data, which does not rely on consumers self-reporting their bag use.====Using quasi-random variation in policy adoption and bag use data over time, I employ an event study design to quantify the effect of DCB policies on the use of plastic, paper, reusable carryout bags, as well as the sale of four types of trash bags. The results show that a 40 million pound reduction of plastic per year from the elimination of plastic carryout bags is offset by an additional 12 million pounds of plastic from increased purchases of trash bags. In particular, sales of small, medium, and tall trash bags increase by 120%, 64%, and 6%, respectively. This means that 28.5 percent of the plastic reduction from DCB policies is lost due to consumption shifting towards unregulated trash bags. The results also provide a lower bound for the reuse of plastic carryout bags, with 12–22% of plastic carryout bags reused as trash bags pre-regulation. In other words, a substantial proportion of carryout bags were already reused in a way that avoided the manufacture and purchase of another plastic bag.====These results provide an estimate of the share of consumers already behaving in a manner that reduces waste and carbon emissions. This is akin to the economic debate over how many recipients of environmental subsidies are “non-additional”—i.e., getting paid to do what they would have done anyway (Joskow and Marron, 1992; Chandra et al., 2010; Gallagher and Muehlegger, 2011; Boomhower and Davis, 2014; Ito, 2015).==== For instance, Boomhower and Davis (2014) find that half of all study participants that received an energy-efficiency subsidy would have replaced their appliances with no subsidy. The concern is that a subsidy will not be cost-effective if a large enough fraction of consumers is non-additional. In the case of DCB policies, instead of rewarding too many consumers for the green behavior they would have done anyway, DCB policies restrict the choice set of green behaviors available, preventing green behaviors that would have been done anyway. Therefore, this paper empirically addresses the critical question of “subtractionality”—i.e., how many consumers would have reused their plastic carryout bags as trash bags, had they not been banned. Moreover, this paper examines ==== are the subtractional customers. Supplemental heterogeneity analyses reveal that plastic bag reuse is correlated with having a pet or a baby (i.e., having dependents whose waste must be collected and disposed of), spending less per item (i.e., bargain shopping), purchasing more items per trip, and having a college degree.====This article also extends the literature on pollution leakage and spillover effects. While numerous studies analyze leakage related to regulating production-driven externalities (such as greenhouse gas emissions),==== the empirical literature examining leakage from regulating consumption-driven externalities is limited. Adda and Cornaglia (2010) analyze the effect of smoking bans in public places on exposure to second-hand smoke. The authors find that bans displace smokers to private places where they contaminate non-smokers, especially young children. Davis (2008) studies a policy in Mexico City where drivers are prohibited from using their vehicles one weekday per week on the basis of the last digit of their vehicle's license plate. The author finds no change in air quality due to the policy; instead, drivers circumvent the restriction by increasing the total number of vehicles in circulation. Similar to these studies, I find that DCB policies are circumvented by consumers substituting towards unregulated plastic bags.====Finally, this paper contributes to the literature by examining the persistent effects of behavioral interventions. Do interventions set a new behavioral status quo (or default) which lasts indefinitely, or do behaviors drift as people re-optimize? Cronqvist et al. (2018) argue that this question has not received enough attention, and as it is inevitably an empirical question, we should expect variability across contexts. Cronqvist et al. (2018) find that the effects of defaults in pension plan selection are remarkably persistent, lasting nearly two decades. Allcott and Rogers (2014) study the short-run and long-run effects of monthly social comparison reports on energy use and find the average treatment effect increases at a declining rate over the first four reports and then persists for the remainder of the reports. Conversely, Jacobsen (2011) found that the release of Al Gore's documentary ==== led to a temporary increase in household purchases of voluntary carbon offsets—the effect only lasting a couple of months. Similar to these studies, this paper is able to analyze the persistent effects of DCB regulations on bag use. The results reveal that increased sales of trash bags persist at least four years after policy implementation (the entire length of the post-policy sample period).====Policy-induced changes in plastic bag use have implications for greenhouse gas emissions, marine debris, and landfilling. I conclude this article by discussing the benefits of reduced litter and marine debris from thin plastic carryout bags, the costs of greater emissions from the production of thicker bags, and the costs of thicker bags taking up more space in landfills. If carbon footprint was the only metric of environmental success, the results in this paper suggest DCB policies are having an adverse effect. However, if the unmeasured benefits with respect to marine debris, toxicity, and wildlife are great enough, they could outweigh the greenhouse gas costs. While the upstream relationship between plastic production and carbon footprint is well understood, the downstream relationship between plastic litter and marine ecosystems is less established, making it challenging to evaluate the environmental success of DCB policies. However, it is clear that ignoring leakage overstates the regulation's welfare gains.====The remainder of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the policy implementation variation and catalogs the data. Section 3 presents the event study empirical design. Section 4 reports the event study results, as well as robustness checks.

Profit-neutral permit allocations are defined as the number of permits that the regulator should give for free so that post-regulation profits (i.e. a firm's profits in the products market plus the value of the allowances granted for free) are equal to pre-regulation profits. The proposed model is developed by assuming that firms use polluting technologies and compete “à la Cournot”. The paper demonstrates that a low number of free allowances is sufficient to meet these two goals. Moreover, the regulator can fully ====, even when the reduction in emissions is high, provided that the sectors concerned are not monopolies, both for isoelastic and linear demand functions.","In 2005, the EU set up the European Emission Trading Scheme (EU-ETS), a large cap-and-trade system designed to enforce its international commitments to reducing CO2 emissions. The first two phases (2005–2007 and 2008–2012) were characterized by the distribution of free allocations, the use of grandfathered allocations, and a low percentage reduction in emissions. These mechanisms induced an increase in profits but also generated loss of competitiveness and leakage - i.e. the substitution of emissions from environmentally regulated countries to countries without effective environmental policies. In light of these results, the EU decided to revise the allocation rules for its third phase (2013–2020). Although it has abandoned grandfathering in favor of innovative distribution measures linked to production capacities, the EU has only achieved a low percentage reduction in emissions. This positioning is highly problematic since it has been proven that emissions must be drastically reduced to respond to climate change issues (Meyer et al., 2014; Raftery et al., 2017). The EU must therefore find a way to make more stringent environmental policies acceptable to firms.====It appears crucial to secure firms' acceptance of environmental regulations so that they do not lobby against their application or limit their enforcement. The regulator faces a participation constraint in that it needs to induce firms to support environmental regulation by protecting their profits, while also ensuring the desired outcome of regulation, i.e. effective emission reduction. To reconcile acceptability for the businesses concerned with a strengthened EU environmental policy, a different approach could involve retaining grandfathering while also introducing higher emission reductions.====Profit-neutral permit allocations are used to determine the conditions under which firms will accept regulation. Profit-neutral permit allocations are defined as the number of permits the regulator should give for free so that post-regulation profits (i.e. a firm's profits in the products market plus the value of the allowances granted for free) are equal to pre-regulation profits. This paper aims to determine the maximum amount of permits to grant for free while satisfying the participation constraint. To do so, it analyzes the relationship between profit-neutral permit allocations and the reduction in emissions in a partial equilibrium framework.====The EU-ETS covers oligopolistic sectors (such as cement, electricity, and steel) and encompasses more than three thousand firms.==== Although some firms dominate the market for permits, the three largest emitters - RWE, E.ON, and Vattenfall - emit only 7.1%, 4.7%, and 4.2% of total emissions, respectively. Even power companies are not big enough to manipulate the permit price alone.==== It is hence assumed that firms are price-takers in the permits market and compete “====” in the products markets.====We first assume a general demand function, although we specify this function in a later step for some of our results. There is very little empirical evidence regarding the curvature and the steepness of the demand curve for the products covered by pollution permits markets. Most papers focusing on emission trading schemes use linear demand. Some papers have, however, demonstrated that the pass-through may be higher than 100% for the electricity sector, which is impossible with linear demand. Hintermann (2016) demonstrates that carbon cost pass-through is more than complete during hours of high demand, while the average level of cost pass-through based on all hours is less than 100%. Such results are not sufficient to prove that demand is curved, but justify widening the scope of study beyond linear demand functions. For this reason, we use both linear and isoelastic demand functions.====Our paper also considers that the regulator reduces emissions by applying an emission reduction rate, such that total post-regulation emissions are equal to initial emissions multiplied by one minus the emission reduction rate. This is the approach used by policy makers, who first determine the desired percentage reduction in emissions and then set pollution caps. We further assume that firms can only abate emissions by reducing production.====We firstly demonstrate that when the elasticity of the demand slope is negative and sufficiently high in absolute values, free allowances are not required for profit neutrality. The paper shows that when demand is either isoelastic or linear, the percentage of profit-neutral allowances given for free in fact increases with the percentage reduction in emissions and decreases with the number of firms. These results are consistent with Hepburn et al. (2013) who examine the impact of pollution permits on profits in a generalized Cournot model. They identify a formula for the number of emission permits that must be freely allocated to firms to neutralize the impact on profits of pollution permits and show that it is lower than the Herfindahl index. The authors also use an exogenous permit price to demonstrate that free allowances are not required for profit neutrality in some cases. The present paper is complementary to Hepburn et al. (2013) since it endogenizes the permit price and analyzes the profit-neutral policy in function of the level of emission reduction. This approach requires us to specify the demand function, which differs from that adopted by Hepburn et al. (2013). Hepburn et al. (2013) use the Taylor expansion of the profits function to determine the grandfathering rate that offsets the loss in profit, while the present paper calculates the equilibrium permit price and derives the percentage of profit-neutral allowances.====The second contribution of our paper in relation to Hepburn et al. (2013) is to highlight the constraint satisfied by the regulator: the number of free allowances should be lower than the number of permits put into circulation.==== If not, the permit price would be equal to zero.==== Hepburn et al. (2013) state that, to achieve profit-neutrality, an industry may receive more permits than it needs, although they do not prove this assertion. In the present paper, we show that the regulator cannot offset firms' losses in either a monopoly or a duopoly with high emission reductions. We further determine the maximal percentage reduction in emissions that a regulator could set if its goal is to offset losses in profits in order to obtain firms' assent. A crucial policy implication is deduced from this finding: the regulator may implement stringent regulations while satisfying firms' participation constraints.====In the case of international competition, however, unilaterally implementing pollution permits induces a loss of competitiveness and generates leakage. The present paper establishes that the conditions required to make environmental regulation acceptable are more stringent and suggests that if there are large numbers of domestic firms and few foreign firms, then offsetting losses in profits may be possible. We extend our analysis to a market for permits covering several sectors and assess the way different sectors are affected by the implementation of pollution permits.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the modeling assumptions. Section 3 focuses on a representative sector not exposed to international competition.

However, simple measures of personality can help to explain economic values and choices in a systematic way. In this paper, we examine the effects of personality on individual economic choices over public environmental goods. Based on three datasets from three separate stated preference studies, we use a hybrid choice ","In a recent paper, Boyce et al. (2016b) make the following comment:====We show, using insights from psychology, that personality can be used to produce testable hypotheses on how economic choices and values vary between individuals. As noted by Grebitus et al. (2013), “… personality might serve an important role in ==== predicting outcomes and explaining variation in economically-relevant behaviours” (page 11: emphasis added). Personality, we argue, can be considered in a similar manner to “standard” socio-economic variables, such as income, which are often used by micro-economists to explain heterogeneity in preferences for a particular class of goods, and to predict choices. Moreover, psychological theory and evidence can be exploited to produce testable, stable, and generalizable relationships between personality traits and economic choice, in much the same way as income can be used to explain demand heterogeneity in a predictable manner. Personality traits are simple to measure in household or individual surveys, using for instance a ten-item set of standard questions. We therefore argue that personality should not be consigned to the un-observables of a demand or indirect utility function, but should instead be treated as a measurable co-determinant of demand, alongside factors such as income, educational status, or age.====In this paper, we examine the effects of personality on individual economic choices over public environmental goods using a stated preference approach. We examine the potential for personality traits to explain preference heterogeneity within an environmental policy context. Based on three data sets from three separate, independent choice modelling studies, we examine the effects of personality on preferences for a change in the status quo, for changes in environmental quality, and over the costs of investing in environmental improvement. We show that incorporating personality research into economic models can provide valuable behavioural insights, since it allows a previously underexplored class of influences on preference heterogeneity to be modelled, thus enriching explanations of why the demand for environmental goods varies across people.",Personality and economic choices,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069617304941,March 2019,2019,Research Article,330.0

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is charged with overseeing state efforts and has at its disposal formal tools to discipline lax states, tools which are rarely used. In this paper, we explore the extent to which the EPA's now-defunct Clean Air Act Watch List served as an informal tool for influencing the enforcement activities of state regulators. We estimate ==== designed around the primary listing criteria for the Watch List. Our empirical results are consistent with the average state regulator acting to reduce the chances of their facilities appearing on the Watch List. We also examine heterogeneity in the response to the Watch List between two states with high numbers of regulated facilities, Texas and California. We find a larger change in enforcement activity under the Watch List among state and local regulators in Texas compared to California.","Local administration of key environmental statutes like the Clean Air Act (CAA), the Clean Water Act (CWA), and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) is a defining feature of environmental federalism in the U.S. Within this system, most state environmental authorities, as opposed to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), have primary responsibility for monitoring and enforcement of regulated entities within their geographic boundaries. The major advantages and disadvantages of devolving authority to local control can be summarized relatively concisely.==== Decentralization allows local authorities to administer regulations in ways that take into account local preferences, knowledge, and constraints. A primary concern associated with decentralization is that devolution could lead to a “race to the bottom” in which local jurisdictions choose increasingly lax regulations to compete with one another for limited investment, thus undermining environmental protection. Moreover, to the extent that pollution crosses jurisdictional boundaries, decentralization can lead to suboptimal levels of environmental quality.====In part to guard against these concerns, the federalist system assigns an oversight role to the EPA. Cynthia Giles, former Assistant Administrator of the EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, argued over 20 years ago that “EPA's job is to oversee what States are doing” and that the EPA “wants to ensure that citizens across the country have the same or very similar benefits of a clean environment” (Giles, 1997, p. 20). However, in spite of the significance of the EPA-state regulator relationship in our environmental federalist system, we know surprisingly little about the specific means by which the EPA implements its oversight role through its interactions with state and local regulations.====The EPA has at its disposal two formal tools to discipline recalcitrant states. Neither is frequently used. First, the EPA may revoke a state's authority, or “primacy,” for a particular environmental program, although to date it has not done so. The EPA has threatened to revoke primacy in a couple of cases (Gray et al., 2012) and, in a few instances, states have returned their primacy to the EPA (Zimmerman, 2009). Second, when the EPA determines that a state's enforcement response to a particular violation is inadequate, the EPA may pursue its own enforcement actions against the violating facility through a process known as “overfiling”. In practice, overfiling is rarely used (Clysdale, 2003). Farber (2016) argues that the threat from the EPA to employ formal measures, such as revocation of primacy, against laggard states is not credible due to the excessively high costs of doing so. In addition to these formal tools, in 2004 the EPA established the State Review Framework (SRF) to consistently assess how states enforce the CAA, the CWA, and RCRA. The SRF produces, for each state, a set of recommendations regarding enforcement practices about once every five years. 85% of the recommendations made in the initial round were adopted by states (U.S. EPA, 2013). According to Blundell (2018), a majority of EPA responding actions against states that failed to adopt recommendations fell in the lowest (i.e., least severe) response tier. Blundell (2018) documents changes in enforcement for some facilities in Florida following its 2012 SRF, consistent with the state regulator responding to the incentives created by the SRF framework.====The main contribution of our paper is to shed light on an informal mechanism, the Clean Air Act Watch List, used by the EPA to influence the enforcement efforts of state and local regulators. The Watch List, created in 2004, was designed as a monthly tracking system for internal use at the EPA to follow the enforcement processes for high priority violations (HPVs) of the CAA that had not been resolved or addressed in a timely fashion. The EPA maintained Watch Lists for the CAA, CWA, and RCRA from January 2004 until August 2013. At that point the Watch List was suspended while the EPA implemented data modernization efforts and completed a review of the Watch List. The Watch List was ultimately discontinued because “the burdens of maintaining and updating the data were greater than the overall benefits” (U.S. EPA, 2014, p. 1). While the Watch List was initially intended for the EPA‘s internal use, many monthly lists were eventually publicly released following several requests by the media and NGOs under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).==== Evans (2016) examines the effect of the CAA Watch List on the subsequent behavior of facilities listed on the Watch List and finds that both initial listing and the public disclosure of the Watch List improved compliance at listed facilities.====In contrast to Evans, we focus on how the CAA Watch List impacted the behavior of state and local regulators, rather than the listed facilities. Ours is among a small number of papers that empirically examine the use of an informal mechanism by federal regulators to influence state regulator behavior in a federalist system. Because the specific ways in which the EPA used the Watch List remain unclear, it is difficult to directly analyze the ex post responses of state regulators to having their facilities appear on the list. However, the available documentation on the Watch List makes it clear that having facilities appear on the Watch List imposed costs on state and local regulators. As a result, our empirical design focuses on ex ante changes in the enforcement efforts of state and local regulators that would reduce the likelihood of their facilities appearing on the Watch List.====Our identification strategy takes advantage of the primary listing criteria for the Watch List—a facility is placed on the Watch List if it has a high priority violation that is not addressed or resolved within about 270 days of being detected. We exploit this discontinuity at “Day 270” created by the listing criteria. Specifically, we design event studies to detect a change in the timing of state enforcement actions, around the Day 270 deadline, at facilities with high priority violations during the time period the Watch List was in effect compared to when it was not.==== We find an increase in state enforcement activity in the periods leading up to Day 270 and a drop in enforcement activity in the period immediately following Day 270 under the Watch List regime compared to when the Watch List was not in effect. Because we include a large set of fixed effects in our analysis and violations are continuously discovered, any confounding event would have to start at roughly the same time as the Watch List and have a differential effect on behavior at the same 270-day cut-off. To our knowledge, there are no events that occurred at the same time that would have such an effect.====Closely related to our analysis, previous research examines enforcement outcomes under environmental federalism. A number of studies in this literature document differences in state and federal enforcement actions across diverse regulatory domains. Thompson and Scicchitano (1985) find lower penalty rates but higher inspection and citation rates among states with primacy for Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OHSA) programs compared to those without. Morantz (2009) finds that state OSHA inspectors use traditional enforcement tools more sparingly than their federal counterparts, typically citing fewer violations and collecting lower fines per violation. More recently, Agarwal et al. (2014) find that federal banking regulators downgrade supervisory ratings of banks almost twice as often as state regulators.==== Atlas (2007) finds that RCRA penalties assessed by state regulators are significantly lower than those assessed by federal regulators. Grooms (2015) examines the impact of state authorization on enforcement actions under the Clean Water Act (CWA). While she does not distinguish between federal and state efforts, her results suggest that the transition to state control did not affect the number of CWA inspections or enforcement actions in the average state. Specifically, she finds no evidence of a clear break when the average state becomes authorized; the trends pre-authorization continue post-authorization.==== Like many of the studies in this literature, our results are consistent with differences in the enforcement priorities of state regulators and those of the federal EPA.====A handful of studies explore oversight of environmental regulators. Langpap and Shimshack (2010) examine the effect of citizen suits on combined state and federal monitoring and enforcement actions under the CWA. They find that private suits increase the number of inspections, but decrease the number of sanctions and the existence and size of penalties. Ashenmiller and Norman (2011) find increased monitoring and enforcement of CAA-regulated facilities among states that adopt laws banning strategic lawsuits against public participation. More recently, Grant and Grooms (2017) explore role of nonprofits in improving compliance among facilities regulated under the CWA. Of course, citizen suits and nonprofits are a form of third party oversight and as such are likely driven by different objectives than one might expect for federal oversight, the focus of our analysis.====This paper adds to the existing literature in a number of ways. First, our results provide insights into the specific means by which the federal environmental regulator, the EPA, oversees and structures incentives for state and local environmental regulators within the U.S. federalist system. Of more direct practical import, our findings identify an additional role for the now-defunct Watch List beyond the effects previously documented by Evans (2016), influencing the enforcement efforts of state and local regulators. Our results suggest that the Watch List succeeded in bringing the enforcement behavior of state and local regulators more in line with stated federal objectives to address high priority violations in a timely manner. Finally, we adopt a relatively novel empirical approach that exploits a discontinuity in Watch List listing criteria within an event study. Although the Watch List was discontinued in 2014, our analysis illustrates how such a tool can be used to oversee state regulators and their environmental enforcement efforts – an issue that is quite timely given the potential for environmental regulations to be further devolved to U.S. states.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section we review the existing literature on federalism and the enforcement of environmental regulations before providing a more complete description of the CAA Watch List in Section 3.

Examples of these unintended consequences have been associated with regulations ranging from the Endangered Species Act to laws governing clean air. In this paper we investigate an unintended behavioral response that can be triggered by conservation measures in multispecies fishery management, which leads to increased targeting of the species the conservation measures are meant to protect. Harvest is subject to stochastic variation, with output partially determined by the probability of encountering species of interest, either due to targeting or avoidance. Given the right conditions, an intertemporal arbitrage opportunity arises due to the fact that by targeting a stock in the current period, the probability of encountering that stock in the next period, when announced conservation measures are implemented, decreases. We present an empirical case study that supports the findings of the theoretical model. The results indicate that, by targeting so called weak stocks, some New England fishermen are willing to trade off increased costs today for increased expected profits in the future. To prevent the potentially harmful effects of this behavioral response, a manager may adopt precautionary provisions at the time a quota reduction is announced, or alternatively allow the ==== to bank part of its current season's quota in order to alleviate the consequences of the reduction in the ensuing period. These results highlight the challenge of developing effective conservation strategies.","Instances are plentiful in natural resources management in which the unintended effects of well-intentioned policies undermine the manager's objectives, leading to policy failure. This may stem from the enactment of new rules that conflict with existing regulations or that interact with the natural environment and existing regulations in unforeseen ways, creating perverse incentives and leading to unsustainable use.====For example, the “beneficial-use” laws requiring land users to make productive use of water and forest resources under the threat of expropriation, higher taxes, or other increased fees have accelerated land conversion and deforestation in a number of countries (Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity, 2011). Similarly, it has been argued that the traditional regulatory approach of the Endangered Species Act, based on land-use restrictions, has failed to protect certain endangered species on private land. Assigning protective status to species whose habitat is on private land may actually create incentives to (illegally) remove the species (a phenomenon popularly known as “shoot, shovel and shut up”, Reiland, 2004). The prospect of regulation can thus encourage property owners to destroy the very resources that these laws seek to protect (Innes et al., 1998; Polasky, 1998; Langpap, 2006; Byrne, 2015). Lueck and Michael (2003) find evidence that landowners have preemptively destroyed habitat for the endangered red-cockaded woodpeckers in the forests of North Carolina in order to avoid potential land-use regulations prescribed under the Endangered Species Act. Langpap and Wu (2017) study the role of pre-listing incentive programs by introducing the possibility of preemptive conservation. They show that landowners' perverse incentives for preemptively destroying habitat still prevail in settings in which the conservation threshold is high.====In the context of wildfire management, Engel (2013) studies the tension between wildfire prevention strategies and air pollution law. The United States is currently witnessing a rapid increase in acres lost to catastrophic wildfires, a phenomenon fed by the warmer and drier conditions associated with climate change. One of the most effective tools to reduce the incidence and severity of unplanned wildfires is fire itself. Prescribed, or controlled, burning reduces the buildup of vegetation resulting from years of wildfire-suppression policy. However, air-pollution law and policy often restrict the use of prescribed burns. Engel (2013) suggests that suppressing prescribed burns may be suboptimal as prescribed burns reduce the smoke emanating from unplanned wildfires, arguably a greater environmental threat.====Fisheries managers typically reduce the extent of stock depletion by limiting effort, often by restricting the length of fishing seasons. However, these regulations create incentives for harvesters to out-compete others by expanding vessel size and speed, amount of gear, number of crew, or by making other costly capital investments. In derby-style fisheries it is not uncommon for seasons to be reduced to a few days in an attempt to limit harvest to a sustainable level. The competitive nature of such fisheries results in rent dissipation and in risky behavior such as fishing in poor weather, overloading vessels with fishing gear, and neglecting maintenance (Pfeiffer and Gratz, 2016). Alternative approaches, such as rights-based fisheries management (the allocation of a share of the harvest to individual fishermen, communities, or fishery associations, also called catch shares), can prevent rent dissipation and improve safety by solving many of the problems associated with the competitive race to fish. However, catch shares may also create incentives for “high-grading”, the discarding of fish of lower market value in order to maximize the returns from the catch share (Copes, 1986; Anderson, 1994; Wernerheim and Haedrich, 2007), or in the context of multispecies fisheries, for targeting and overfishing commercial species not included in the quota system (Smith et al., 2009). Additionally, the expectation of catch shares may create incentives for firms to ramp up harvest in order to improve their catch history in anticipation of the allocation of quota.====In this paper we study a phenomenon resembling the infamous Endangered Species Act paradox of “shoot, shovel and shut up”, but arising from the inter-seasonal arbitrage opportunities that the dynamics of regulatory quota-setting create in multi-species fisheries. The underlying incentives presented here have been previously overlooked, but may lead to the strategic targeting and ultimate depletion of stocks managers are trying to protect with stringent fishing quotas. Multispecies fisheries, characterized by joint-production and imperfect targeting, are typically managed with fishery-wide quotas for each of the individual species.==== These quotas are enforced by closing the season —with the associated forgone income for the industry— the moment any of these fishery-wide quotas is reached, even if the limiting (or “choke”) stock is a bycatch species with no commercial value. In these circumstances, the announcement of a significant reduction in any of the low-value species' future quotas may trigger a behavioral response by firms seeking to avoid a costly early season closure in the upcoming period. Indeed, by targeting and depleting the stock of interest in the current period, firms effectively reduce the likelihood that its quota will bind (and the season will close early) in the ensuing period. Thus, even though next year's total allowable catch (TAC) is not conditional on this year's catch, given the right conditions, the probability of encountering a limiting stock is.====A time lag exists between the updating of a stock's overfishing status and the prescribed implementation of rebuilding plans as required by the Magnuson Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA).==== These rebuilding plans typically comprise reductions in annual catch limits and effort restrictions. We develop a theoretical model to characterize conditions under which the regulations meant to rebuild fish populations lead to further stock depletion. In equilibrium, cooperative harvesters strategically trade off higher costs today from targeting a stock likely to become a choke species, for a reduction in the likelihood of hitting its lower TAC (causing a shutdown in access to all the species in the fishery) in the next season. As we demonstrate, to prevent the potentially harmful effects of this behavioral response, a manager may adopt precautionary provisions at the time the quota reduction is announced, or alternatively allow the industry to bank part of its current season's quota to alleviate the reduction in the ensuing period.====Using data from the Northeast Multispecies fishery, we find evidence of behavioral responses consistent with the predictions of the theoretical model. In September 2011 a substantial cut to the Georges Bank yellowtail flounder TAC was announced, to take effect starting in May 2012. We show that between September 2011 and May 2012, groundfish fishermen increased targeting of this stock, with no obvious incentive unless the intertemporal nature of the problem is considered. Ultimately, the fishery caught a substantially higher percentage of the stock than the recent historical trend. Total yellowtail biomass is estimated to have decreased by roughly 74% on Georges Bank between 2010 and 2013. The stock has yet to recover from this decline. In this paper, we identify the predicted shift in the shadow price for yellowtail —consistent with direct targeting of the stock— after reductions in the next year's TACs have been announced. Furthermore, our empirical results confirm previous findings regarding the ability of harvesters to adjust their catch composition by redeploying quasi-fixed inputs across time and space in response to changing incentives (Sanchirico et al., 2006; Reimer et al. 2017a, 2017b). By analyzing harvesters' incentives to engage in intertemporal quota arbitrage and the mechanism to implement it, the paper contributes to the growing body of work on multispecies fisheries management and bycatch mitigation (Turner, 1997; Singh and Weninger, 2009; Abbott and Wilen, 2009; Abbott and Haynie, 2012). As far as we know, this is the first study to show that the incentives akin to those underlying “shoot, shovel and shut up” may also be at play in marine systems.====The paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we introduce the theoretical model and compare its predictions under alternative assumptions —myopic versus foresighted harvesters. In section 3 we provide the context for the empirical application by reviewing the recent management history of the New England Multispecies Fishery. Next, we characterize the joint technology using the directional distance function and derive the expression for the ratio of output shadow prices. We then describe the identification strategy, specify the stochastic frontier model that will be estimated, and discuss the results of the empirical analysis.

Matched Difference-in-Differences estimates provide robust evidence that contradicts the specter of an erosion of European asset bases. Baseline results for the manufacturing sector indicate that the EU ETS led to an on average increase of treated firms' asset bases of 12,1%. However, for a particular subgroup of MNEs, this increase is a mere 2.1%. For these companies, the EU ETS may have induced a shift in investment priorities.","The EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) is the world's largest carbon market and the EU's flagship tool to combat climate change. The launch of this transboundary carbon trading system marked a severe tightening of environmental regulation in a unilateral way: Starting in the year 2005, EU firms in energy and manufacturing industries faced a strict cap on their total amount of greenhouse gas emissions. An important starting point of this paper is that during the first two trading periods (2005–2012), the time frame of our analysis, the European carbon policy was not met by any comparable initiatives in other world regions. Even though a number of programs were started subsequently to the EU ETS, these regionally or temporally confined efforts did not alter its unilateral character. They were substantially limited in terms of stringency and scope (e.g. country, sectors and emissions coverage) and in several cases even discontinued. With the start of trading in the EU, the share of global emissions covered by a carbon price jumped from less than 1% to around 5% (Worldbank et al., 2017). It remained largely the same until 2012. Against this backdrop, concerns about potentially negative competitiveness impacts on regulated businesses under the EU ETS were voiced from its inception and have not died out since.====The concern that unilateral environmental regulations might impose significant costs, divert resources from productive activities and ultimately put the international competitiveness of regulated firms at risk is widespread among economists, policymakers and industry representatives. In case of a persistent international asymmetry in the stringency of environmental regulation, the pollution haven hypothesis postulates that affected businesses may move production capacity to countries that impose a lighter regulatory burden. In the context of climate change policies, such a shift creates “carbon leakage”, since the emissions would move together with the relocated production. In this scenario, the unilateral environmental policy backfires economically and ecologically, combining a loss of economic activity in industrial sectors with, at best, environmental ineffectiveness, or worse, an outright negative effect if production outside of the regulated area is carried out in a more carbon intensive way. Such a process would manifest itself in the form of an erosion of the regulated firms' asset bases in Europe.====This study is the first comprehensive analysis of the EU ETS that investigates industrial relocation in the form of a possible erosion of European assets by assessing the risk where it is most likely to materialize first, i.e. within subgroups of multinational enterprises that already encompass firms within and outside of the regulated area. Using an extensive firm-level accounting database, we are not only able to match 96% of 8.578 EU ETS-firms (8.218) with respective financial accounts and thereby cover 14.507 out of 15.043 installations regulated by the EU ETS (as of March 2014). Additionally, the global reach of our firm database provides the basis for the identification of five types of business group structures, reaching from single firms over variants of multi-firm business groups within the EU ETS (i.e. with establishments in one or several EU ETS-countries) to two different subgroups of global multinational enterprises.====This differentiated identification of corporate structures across the universe of firms subjected to the EU ETS is essential to address our research question. Due to their specific organizational structure, only global multinational enterprises with existing firms inside and outside of the regulated area may possess the opportunity of a gradual reaction at rather low relocation costs. If relocation takes place on an important scale via this channel, we should observe asset erosion for these firms or at least no substantial increases in the asset base. We argue that the cost barrier for a relocation of economic activity should be lowest within global business groups that comprise, regarded from the viewpoint of a specific firm subject to the EU ETS, at least one firm that operates in the same sub-sector but is located outside of the regulated area. In principle, this would allow for a simple shift of production between already existing firms. We therefore designate the firm in such a business group as ====. In contrast, we denote a treated firm as belonging to a ==== if the business group is indeed spread across regulated and unregulated countries but lacks ownership of a sectoral sibling outside of the EU ETS.====We set up our research design with the explicit aim to detect indications for processes of asset erosion and creeping deindustrialization by focusing on, as our central variable of interest, the net tangible fixed assets as recorded in the annual accounts. It states the value of production capacities such as plants, machinery and equipment. A rising year on-year value reflects net investment in these assets whereas a declining value points towards a divestment or a lack of replacement investment. At the same time, this outcome variable embodies a forward-looking quality. Due to the inherent link between the evolution of the value of tangible assets and the underlying investment activity of the respective firm, which is by definition forward looking, the analysis also reflects the regulatory pressure that treated firms expect the EU ETS to exert in the long run.====We apply a matched Difference in Differences (DiD) approach that exploits inclusion criteria of the EU ETS to compare firms that are very similar in a number of important characteristics but, due to the application of specific thresholds at the installation level, fall under different regulatory regimes since the start of the EU ETS in 2005. This study design enables us to control for confounding factors that affect regulated and unregulated firms and to take account of firm-level heterogeneity. By means of this quasi-experimental approach, we assess the impact of the EU ETS on the fixed asset bases of treated firms. To investigate in particular whether firms that belong to global multinational enterprises react differently than firms without this structure-based option, we interact the treatment effect with an indicator variable that denotes for every firm to which kind of business group structure it belongs.====Highly significant baseline results for the whole treatment period from 2005 through 2012 indicate that the EU ETS led to an overall increase of treated firms' fixed asset bases of 11,2%. In the subsample for the manufacturing sector, which is at the center of fears with respect to industrial relocation, this overall effect reaches a size of 12.1%. Notably, we find that EU ETS-firms which are part of a global MNE with a functional link do not behave different than the remainder of the sample. This is important since these companies not only could relocate capacities to non-regulated regions at relatively low costs, but also account for an important share of emissions under the EU ETS. However, we find a markedly different reaction for those treated firms that belong to a global MNE without a functional link. Treated firms that belong to this category of MNEs display a highly significant interaction effect. It implies an increase in tangible fixed assets of only 2.1%, i.e. 10.0% below the remainder of the treatment group.====Assessing the first two trading phases separately reveals that both effects, the overall treatment effect and the differential effect for firms of the manufacturing sector that belong to global MNEs without functional link, are more pronounced in phase II.====The overall effect of broad asset increases proves to be highly robust when we put more weight on internal validity and tighten the sample restrictions. At the same time, it also extends to larger, less restrictive samples that cover up to 54% of total emissions regulated and are similar to the matched raw data in terms of country spread. The same holds true for the interaction effect for global MNEs without a functional link in the manufacturing sector. It is robust and present in samples that comprise up to 39.4% of total regulated emissions from that sector.====Our study contributes to ex-post evaluations of the EU ETS in general by delivering a very comprehensive cross-country analysis and to the discussion on industrial relocation in particular by providing a new perspective on asset erosion in Europe. We find robust evidence that contradicts the idea of a creeping erosion of European asset bases as a consequence of carbon policy. The EU ETS appears to have increased the asset bases in Europe, even though for a subgroup of MNEs the effect is less sizeable and could indicate some shift in their regional investment priorities.==== Our study relates to three different strands of research. Firstly, we contribute to the literature on the pollution haven hypothesis (see Brunnermeier and Levinson, 2004; Copeland and Taylor, 2004; and Erdogan, 2014 for reviews). With respect to climate policy, carbon price differentials across regions could drive production of energy-intensive goods to “carbon havens”, thereby creating “carbon leakage”. Ex ante simulations that try to gauge the size of leakage rates with Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models conclude that the leakage rate of a unilateral carbon tax (or ETS) is in the range of 5%–30% (Böhringer et al., 2012; Zhang, 2012). However, the few ex-post studies for the EU ETS have so far not revealed any substantial leakage effect, neither via sectoral trade flows (e.g. Naegele and Zaklan, 2019), nor through a rise in Foreign Direct Investment, analyzed for Italian MNEs by Borghesi et al. (2018) and for German MNEs by Koch and Basse Mama (2016). The study by Dechezleprêtre et al. (2015) is so far the investigation that most closely shares our conceptual emphasis on potential intra-firm shifts of emissions. We contribute to this literature by providing a comprehensive analysis that draws on 96% of the firms subject to the EU ETS and focuses on European asset bases rather than outward effects.====Secondly, this study is related to the growing empirical literature that evaluates the impact of the EU ETS on various dimensions of firm competitiveness (Anger and Oberndorfer, 2008; Abrell et al., 2011; Bushnell et al., 2013; Chan et al., 2013; Commins et al., 2011; Petrick and Wagner, 2014; Wagner et al., 2014; see the review by Martin et al., 2016). A broad set of indicators is used to analyze effects on economic performance, such as profits, revenues, output, and employment. Early contributions often lacked a convincing identification strategy, falling short of the requirements for providing credible estimates of policy impacts as delineated in, e.g., Imbens and Wooldridge (2009) or Greenstone and Gayer (2009). Calel and Dechezleprêtre (2016) were the first to introduce the idea of exploiting the installation-level inclusion criteria of the EU-ETS to compare firms that are very similar but differ in their treatment status. In the context of competitiveness, recent studies built on this concept and applied quasi-experimental techniques to obtain more credible estimates based on country specific administrative data (Petrick and Wagner, 2014; Wagner et al., 2014) or commercial databases (Marin et al., 2018).====Finally, our analysis of corporate structures based on the bottom-up tracing of majority ownership links relates to similar endeavors by Jaraite et al. (2013), Vitali et al. (2011), Altomonte and Rungi (2013) and UNCTAD (2016, chap. IV). Given that multinational enterprises are the dominant force in the economic sectors subject to the EU ETS, the explicit consideration of these structural aspects is clearly warranted. Studies from empirical management science like Fisch and Zschoche (2011) show that multinationality can, besides other benefits, also provide operational flexibility to firms that might be faced with adverse cost shocks in one or several locations, an argument raised on theoretical grounds already by de Meza and van der Ploeg (1987). This benefit was later framed as the “option value of a multinational network” by Kogut and Kulatilaka (1994). The differential results that we obtain for treated firms that belong to a special variant of global MNEs suggest that the explicit analysis of ownership complexity is an important issue in evaluations of environmental policy instruments like the EU ETS.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the institutional background for our analysis with respect to the EU ETS. Section 3 provides a description of the data as well as descriptive evidence for the high relevance of global MNEs within the EU ETS. Section 4 outlines our empirical strategy. In section 5, we present the results of our analysis. Section 6 discusses the results and concludes.",Multinational corporations and the EU Emissions Trading System: The specter of asset erosion and creeping deindustrialization,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069617305521,March 2019,2019,Research Article,333.0

One of the most significant impacts of these emissions is poor water quality. Runoff and leaching from agriculture and mining can contaminate surface and ground water bodies with excess nutrients (such as phosphorus and nitrogen) and toxic substances (such as arsenic). This contamination increases infant mortality and digestive cancer (Brainerd and Menon, 2014; Ebenstein, 2012) and is a major threat to natural assets such as Chesapeake Bay, the Gulf of Mexico and the Great Barrier Reef (GBRA, 2014; EPA, 2009). The regulation of diffuse emissions is complicated by a number of factors. First, the emissions of any individual source are not observed. Second, ambient, or measurable, pollution fluctuates with both random weather events and natural emissions and is therefore stochastic. Finally, in practice regulators are required to take into account “ability to pay” and are frequently constrained by statutory limits on penalties that they can levy. The US EPA for example is constrained by maximum limits under the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act among others.====We characterize the primary regulatory problem as one of moral hazard. Moral hazard arises because emissions are unobservable and because ambient pollution, which is observed, is stochastic. The regulator (principal) must design the optimal set of incentives to induce abatement from multiple polluters (firms). The regulator and firms interact over an infinite horizon subject to the firms' entry and exit decisions. These firms are risk neutral but at any point in time they are limited by credit constraints that are reflected in statutory limits on fines. The regulator is therefore constrained in that transfers from each firm have a strict lower bound.====We demonstrate that the regulation of diffuse emissions would be feasible via the combination of two simple incentive mechanisms: a constant tax flow and rebates that depend on the history of pollution (====). The constant tax flow respects the lower bound constraint on the transfer flow, while the long run incentives provided by the rebates ensure that firms have sufficient incentive to abate. By leveraging dynamic incentives, the regulator is able to ensure that firms abate even if the fines that can be mandated are severely constrained in the short term.====We employ the continuous-time methods pioneered by Sannikov (2008) to solve the moral hazard problem. We model the accumulation of pollution as a Brownian motion whose drift is affected by the firms' emissions. These firms can be thought of as drilling sites with runoff that affects water quality. The nature of runoff and leakage means that contaminants enter air or water at many unknown points, and neither the volume nor the content contributed by an individual source can be measured. Firms can undertake costly abatement actions, for example exert costly effort to maintain the integrity of wells and containment ponds. It is either too costly to verify these actions or they are unverifiable.====We assume restoration activities are not feasible and consider the special case where it is optimal for the regulator to keep the stock of pollution constant, so that all active firms must abate their emissions.==== More generally, one could imagine a setting in which a social planner must determine the optimal abatement effort and the allocation of that effort across firms. As long as the damage from emissions is sufficiently high, the contract we outline will be the optimal solution to this social planner's problem.====We compare the optimal contract and the firms' expected payoffs to two benchmarks: observable emissions and no transfer flow constraint. The setting with observable emissions can be taken to represent the regulation of sources of emissions that can be monitored; these sources are the focus of the vast bulk of current regulation. In this benchmark, the regulator levies a tax on any firm that fails to abate equal to the cost of their abatement. When emissions are not observed, but there is no constraint on transfers to and from the firm, we show that a firm's current payoff (i.e., not their future payoff) is tied to the flow of pollution. If there is an arbitrarily large negative shock to the pollution stock, a firm may then have to pay an arbitrarily large penalty. We view this feature of the contract without a transfer flow constraint as unrealistic.====We derive the comparative statics of the effect of changes in the parameters determining the firms' payoffs on the optimal contract and we apply the model to the problem of water pollution from a fracking operation, demonstrating the impact of limited liability on firm entry, exit and the cost of regulation across multiple scenarios.====Our paper intersects two independent literature. The first is devoted to the regulation of diffuse emissions (see Fisher-Vanden and Olmstead, 2013, for a recent survey). Within this literature, the closest papers propose incentives that depend on the difference between the desired and realized aggregate ambient pollution stock. Segerson (1988) first proposed a combination of per-unit and lump sum taxes and rebates in a static environment. Subsequent extensions to dynamic and stochastic environments were then undertaken by Xepapadeas (1992) and Athanassoglou (2010).====As convincingly argued by Karp (2005), there are two important barriers to the implementation of this type of aggregate ambient taxation. First, when the evolution of pollution is stochastic, the burden of transfers from individual firms may be large and reasonably viewed as exceeding political or financial constraints. Second, the aggregate burden of taxes may exceed the social cost of damage and lead to inefficient levels of entry and exit. Unlike the optimal control models of Xepapadeas (1992) and Athanassoglou (2010), we find the contract that solves the regulator's principal-agent problem incorporating an exogenously given constraint on transfers from firms as well as firm entry and exit. Despite the differences in our approach, the mechanism that solves this problem shares some features of the original static scheme proposed by Segerson (1988). Unlike Segerson's proposal, however, in our solution taxation is always lump sum and rebates are a function of dynamic rather than static performance.====The second literature is concerned with the management of environmental damage in the presence of firms with limited liability. In the classic set-up a firm with limited liability undertakes an environmentally risky activity and exerts costly but unobserved safety care to reduce the probability of some severe environmental harm. A particular concern of this literature is to what extent the judgment-proof problem can be ameliorated by extending liability to financiers and other stakeholders (Pitchford, 1995; Boyer and Laffont, 1997; Hiriart and Martimort, 2006; Hiriart et al., 2011).==== Our setting differs in that we consider multiple firms whose unobserved action is abatement rather than safety precaution and where environmental damages are not limited to severe discrete events. In this setting, we show that making use of dynamic incentives can alleviate limited liability constraints in the regulation of environmentally damaging activities.====While others have adopted a principal-agent framework to study the regulation of diffuse emissions in static environments (Chambers and Quiggin, 1996), we are the first to do so in a dynamic, continuous time setting with a stochastic pollution flow. The dynamic incentive regulation we propose is related to, but different from, the incentive regulation of public utilities (for a survey, see Laffont and Tirole, 1993). The focus of the literature on incentive regulation is to elicit cost information from a public utility; the workhorse is a static, adverse selection model in which the public utility is a monopolist with private information about its cost. We, on the other hand, study a model of dynamic moral hazard.====Finally, our paper is related to the dynamic principal-agent literature. Dynamic contracts can differ significantly to those in static settings, yet dynamic models that use the standard optimal control approach can be intractable once one introduces realistic features like limited liability and entry and exit. To overcome these difficulties, we formulate our model as a dynamic continuous time agency problem using the tractable machinery introduced by Sannikov (2008). The main technical advantage of his methods is that the optimal contract can be found by solving an ordinary differential equation, allowing for a detailed description of the optimal contract and for simple comparative statics analysis.====The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 outlines the model and Section 3 derives the optimal contract. Section 4 contains the comparative statics analysis of the optimal contract. Section 5 simulates an application of the model to a fracking operation. Finally, Section 6 concludes.",Dynamic incentive regulation of diffuse pollution,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069618301992,January 2019,2019,Research Article,334.0

Our focus is on illegal disposal of household garbage in residential areas. At a random subset of 56 locations in a mid-sized city, law enforcement officers supplemented their regular enforcement activities by the practice of putting brightly-colored warning labels on illegally disposed garbage bags. This treatment made the existing enforcement activities suddenly much more apparent to residents. We find evidence for a substantial reduction in illegal disposal of garbage in response to the treatment.","Governments around the world spend substantial resources on law enforcement in an attempt to reduce crime. While the success of such policies is sometimes debated in the popular media, scholars in criminology and economics have by now built up a substantial body of evidence showing that police commonly drives down crime, even though the size of the effect depends on the exact context and the way resources are deployed (Durlauf and Nagin, 2011, Nagin, 2013, Nagin, 2016, Chalfin and McCrary, 2017). The evidence also suggests that deterrence tends to be the primary mechanism responsible for the crime-reducing effect (Draca and Machin, 2015).====A critical factor determining the size of the deterrent effect of law enforcement is its salience among potential offenders. Salience refers here to the awareness of the chance of getting caught and the subsequent consequences, and as such is an essential mediator of deterrence. It has been shown that potential offenders are not always fully aware of the parameters of law enforcement. Instead, they develop beliefs based on experiences and observations, with personal experiences of what does and does not happen after they commit an illegal act being a major determinant of those beliefs (Sah, 1991, Lochner, 2007, Hjalmarsson, 2009, Rincke and Traxler, 2011, Anwar and Loughran, 2011; Loughran et al., 2014). Learning about law enforcement based on personal experiences is likely to be slow, however. Generally, the chance of getting caught is low. Consequently, chances are that beliefs about the expected punishment – the product of the chance of getting caught and the punishment – rarely move upward. If potential offenders tend to underestimate the expected punishment in the absence of recent experiences, then they may engage in illegal acts that they would have refrained from if the punishment had been correctly anticipated. Underestimation of the expected punishment may result from being ill-informed, but also from heavily discounting events that have not occurred recently. Moreover, beliefs may be correct, but need not be part of active knowledge. As argued in Bordalo et al. (2013), not all that is known is part of active knowledge, since people cannot attend to everything at once.====In situations like these, greater deterrence might be produced by increasing people's salience of law enforcement deployment, as suggested by Jolls et al. (1998). They provide an appealing example in the context of parking fines. The practice of putting small, plain parking tickets under the windshield wiper could be replaced by a policy of sticking large, brightly-colored tickets that read ‘violation’ in large letters. The cost of doing so are minimal, but the existing enforcement activities suddenly become much more apparent to all those passing by. As a result, potential offenders may be more likely to be deterred.====Our paper is the first to put this idea to the test. We conducted a natural field experiment in which we increased the salience of law enforcement at a random subset of 56 locations for a period of five weeks and observed the behavioral response in terms of the number of violations. We also examine displacement of violations.====The experiment took place in the city of Heerlen, the Netherlands. We study a type of disorderly behavior that is known to be a major irritant in residential areas: illegal disposal of household garbage.==== Given the public outcry and the empirical evidence that a disorderly environment may drive further degradation of the neighborhood (Cialdini et al., 1990, Keizer et al., 2008, Dur and Vollaard, 2015, Keuschnigg and Wolbring, 2015), local authorities often put a lot of effort in keeping the streets clean. In the city of Heerlen, service workers clean all garbage disposal locations scattered around the city several times per week. Moreover, two full-time officers have the sole task to detect and fine offending households at the 56 supposedly messiest locations in the city. These locations include locations with shared garbage bag disposal containers close to homes as well as locations with glass and paper disposal containers at thoroughfares and on squares. The latter type of container has a small opening for bottles or paper and is free to use. Garbage bag disposal containers have a larger opening, but only operate after inserting a card that is exclusively issued to nearby households, with each recorded use costing one euro. The fee of one euro is meant to provide an incentive for households to reduce waste.====In violation with the rules, residents regularly dump garbage bags and all kinds of discarded household items next to both types of containers, creating a mess.==== The two full-time officers make a daily round along the supposedly messiest locations, and search for name and address identifiers in illegally disposed garbage. At the start of our experiment, this intensive enforcement policy had been in place for almost one and a half years. Even though the fine is 90 euro and the chance of being detected is about 5 percent on average, the problem persisted. The muted response to a relatively high expected penalty of 4.50 euro (0.05 times 90 euro) for a rule violation with presumably small benefits (avoiding the fee of 1.00 euro and a bit of effort) provided an ideal setting for an experiment aimed at increasing the salience of existing law enforcement activity.====In the treatment condition, the officers made their activities more salient by marking illegally disposed garbage bags with bright orange labels saying that the item was found by law enforcement and punishable to a fine of 90 euros. The warning labels were visible until the next cleaning of the area around the underground container by the Department of Sanitation, which commonly took place after a couple of hours to one or two days later. A benefit of our setting is that the officers follow a fixed routine: their deployment is independent from the level or trend of illegal disposal at container locations.====Our results are as follows. The estimated average treatment effect is a reduction in illegal garbage disposal by about 30 percent, but the effect is only marginally statistically significant. Further exploration of the data shows that the effect is stronger and more precisely estimated during weeks with a relatively high treatment intensity and at container locations that were relatively clean in the baseline period. We also find that the effect is much larger (a reduction of 50 percent) and statistically significant at locations with garbage bag disposal containers, while a treatment effect is small and statistically insignificant at locations with glass and paper disposal containers. We find some evidence for displacement of illegal disposal. The latter finding should be no surprise since the warning labels also partly reveal which locations are surveilled and which locations are not surveilled.====Our paper contributes to the literature on deterrence. We provide evidence that the size of the deterrent effect is dependent on the salience of law enforcement activity. This finding provides an explanation for the persistence of forms of crime that do not seem to pay, such as bank robberies in the UK (Reilly et al., 2012; see also Wilson and Abrahamse, 1998). Offenders may simply be overly optimistic about the expected return to crime if the upside is salient. The opposite should then also be true: when the downside is salient, we should not observe crime that does seem to pay. Our paper also provides an explanation for the mixed evidence of the effect of punishment on offending: not all shocks in punishment that were studied may be equally salient (see Lee and McCrary, 2017 and Hinnerichs et al., 2017 for recent discussions of the literature). The possible effect of salience cannot easily be gleaned from categorizing studies into being based on a salient or a not-so-salient shock in punishment, however, since methods, population under study, and context differ as well.====Our findings are of direct relevance to deterrence policy. Enhancing the salience of law enforcement can be a relatively swift and cheap way of reducing crime and disorder. It can reduce crime and disorder in two ways. First, salience can correct unjustified beliefs that enforcement policy is lax. As such, it can substitute for actual experience with the long arm of the law, cutting short a drawn-out process of adjustment of individual beliefs (as documented in Lochner, 2007 and Rincke and Traxler, 2011, for instance). It can be seen as an efficient way of bringing behavior in line with the expected punishment. Second, it may make potential offenders more attentive to the probability of being detected and the consequences thereof. Rather than having to increase the probability of getting caught, which is costly, or increasing the efficiency or effectiveness of law enforcement, which has proven to be difficult, simply attracting the attention to law enforcement activity may have the desired behavioral effect.==== The treatment should not be seen as independent from the parameters of law enforcement, however. It does not involve any deception; it just emphasizes the current law enforcement policy.====Related to our paper are a series of recent studies in the tax compliance literature: Slemrod et al., 2001, Kleven et al., 2011, Fellner et al., 2013, Del Carpio, 2014, Bott et al., 2015, Castro and Scartascini, 2015, Chirico et al., 2016, Dwenger et al., 2016, Hallsworth et al., 2017 and Perez-Truglia and Trioano (2018) (see Slemrod, 2018 for a review). These studies provide evidence for a deterrent effect of notifications in letters about the threat of being audited and the penalty for tax evasion.==== Likewise, there is an empirical literature on the effect of prohibition and warning signs on illegal activity (see e.g. Keizer et al., 2011, Nettle et al., 2012). Just like these interventions, ours is meant to make enforcement policy more salient. However, it does so in a different way. Rather than notifying potential offenders of future enforcement policy, our intervention provides a credible signal that enforcement is actually taking place.====Most similar to our approach is an intervention evaluated by Lu et al. (2016). They find that when the police sent cell phone text messages to drivers citing their recent traffic violations, the likelihood of future traffic violations reduced substantially. In other treatments, the police sent messages advocating safe driving or warnings about widespread use by the police of video cameras to detect traffic violations. These messages did not have any effect, suggesting that it is not the surprise of receiving a message from the police that drives the response. Obviously, a limitation of their treatment is that it only reminds people who were already fined in the past. Our treatment affects a much broader population of potential offenders. Moreover, our treatment is extremely inexpensive and does not require knowing the identity of the potential offenders.====Our study contributes to the literature on environmental monitoring and enforcement. Shimshack (2014) notes in his recent survey of the literature that “environmental monitoring and enforcement remain both understudied and controversial” (p. 339); in particular, “evidence on deterrence in European contexts is surprisingly rare” (p. 353). Shimshack sees “a promising and growing role for experimental evidence” (p. 353), citing Telle (2013) and Duflo et al. (2013) as leading examples of natural field experiments in this area. Our field experiment adds to this small, but growing body of experimental evidence.====Our paper also contributes to the broader literature on salience and decision making. How attention-grabbing cues – or camouflaged features – affect choices has been studied in several contexts, including product choice (Drèze et al., 1994, Chetty et al., 2009, Bordalo et al., 2013), price setting behavior (Finkelstein, 2009, Grubb, 2015), personal finance (Stango and Zinman, 2014), social security benefits (Brinch et al., 2017), and no-smoking laws (Rigotti et al., 1992). Apart from the literature discussed above, salience has not been studied within the context of illegal behavior.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. The next section presents the contextual background. Section 3 discusses the treatment, data collection, and empirical strategy. Section 4 presents the estimation results.

However, the literature has missed a third effect: a ","Both to reduce dependency on petroleum imports and to reduce air pollution, many countries seek to reduce gasoline consumption from passenger vehicles. In the United States, passenger vehicles account for 16% of all greenhouse gas emissions (US EPA 2015 p. 2–28). Additionally, they are a major source of conventional pollutants such as carbon monoxide, ozone, and fine particulates. These pollutants can cause such health effects as respiratory disease, heart disease and premature mortality. They may be particularly potent in such vulnerable populations as the elderly and young children. Indeed, studies have shown that ==== and childhood exposure to these gasses have the potential to affect various health outcomes in the short- and the long-run (Currie et al., 2014).====Policies to reduce gasoline consumption generally fall into two main categories: price-based policies and performance-based policies. Price-based policies such as a gasoline tax work by making driving more expensive. Among OECD countries, the US has the lowest gasoline taxes save Mexico, at $0.54 per gallon (average state plus federal tax) as of 2015, compared to $2.06 in Japan, $3.64 in Germany, and $4.39 in the UK (OECD, 2016). Performance-based policies mandate minimum average fuel economy standards for the fleet. Examples include the US Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards and similar policies in Europe, Japan, and elsewhere.====Traditionally, the literature assessing the effectiveness of such policies has decomposed their effects into two channels: a ====, relating to the average fuel efficiency of the fleet, and a ====, relating to how much people drive (e.g. Bento et al., 2009, Goldberg, 1998, Li et al., 2009, Puller and Greening, 1999). By increasing the cost of driving, gas taxes create an incentive to drive less as well as to obtain a more fuel-efficient car. Thus, they operate through both channels. Performance standards like CAFE mandate more fuel-efficient cars (on average), but do not create incentives to drive less—indeed, by putting people in more fuel-efficient cars they reduce the cost of driving and increase utilization (the so-called “rebound effect”). Bento et al. (2009) and Gillingham (2012) measure both the compositional and the utilization effects using structural models in which households simultaneously choose an automobile and their level of driving in a consistent framework. They find that the utilization effect is bigger than the compositional effect.====In this paper, we show that this large literature has overlooked a third effect of such policies, a sorting or ====. In theory, even if the compositional and utilization effects are held to zero—that is, even if the fleet remains exactly the same and each household drives exactly the same number of miles annually—an increase in gasoline prices could still reduce gasoline consumption if it leads to stronger assortative matching between high-utilization households and the fuel efficiency of the cars they drive. Intuitively, if a household does little driving, the fuel efficiency of its car has little impact on overall consumption (at the extreme, a car parked in the garage burns no gas regardless of its fuel efficiency), whereas if a household drives great distances the fuel efficiency of its car matters a good deal. Conversely, if a car is very fuel efficient, its utilization has little impact on overall consumption (at the extreme, the utilization of a bicycle would not matter), whereas if a car is fuel inefficient its utilization matters a good deal.====While the literature has long understood that, ceteris paribus, high-utilization households are more likely to choose low-energy alternatives (thus motivating the simultaneous modeling of a household's choice of a product's energy efficiency together with its utilization), to our knowledge the effect of a change in gas prices or other policies on how households are matched to products in equilibrium has been widely neglected in the literature.==== Yet it is not trivial. To gauge the potential importance of the matching effect, if household demand for VMT and vehicle fuel efficiency were perfectly matched in 2009, gasoline consumption would have been 15% lower, even with no change in the composition of the fleet and no change in individuals' utilization.====In addition to pointing out the importance of this effect, in this paper we show that, ====, there are good reasons to believe that higher gasoline prices increase the degree of matching. The intuition is as follows. Increases in gasoline prices increase demand for fuel-efficient cars relative to inefficient ones, because the monetary savings of owning an efficient vehicle increase. But there is exogenous heterogeneity among households in their utilization. When gasoline prices rise, the savings of owning an efficient vehicle increase more for higher-utilization households than for low-utilization households. Consequently, high-utilization households are now comparatively more likely to outbid low-utilization households for fuel-efficient cars (ceteris paribus). Thus, when gas prices increase, the market tends to allocate more fuel-efficient cars to the high-utilization households than before, while low-utilization households are allocated less efficient cars. Accordingly, in equilibrium, after an increase in the gasoline prices, there should be a stronger assortative matching from households, based on the amount of driving they are likely to do, to the fuel economy of the cars they own.====Finally, we test this hypothesis empirically. Using data from the US National Highway Transportation Survey, we adopt a difference-in-differences framework, comparing the way (exogenously) high-utilization households change the fuel economy of their car when gas prices increase relative to the way low-utilization households do. We find a statistically significant matching effect from gas prices that is robust to a variety of identification strategies, including ordinary least squares (OLS) and different ways of instrumenting for utilization. Specifically, we find that when gasoline prices increase by $1, a household responds on average by driving a vehicle that gives 0.02 to 0.05 more miles per gallon for every 1000 miles it drives in the short run, over a 1–2 year period. Using variation only in gasoline taxes, we find an effect of 0.03–0.06 miles per gallon for every 1000 miles. Much (but not all) of this effect appears to be from within-household sorting. While these matching effects may seem small, in the aggregate they correspond to a savings of about 0.8% of fuel consumption, or nearly 1 billion gallons annually, for a $0.50 increase in taxes. These savings in turn correspond to 42 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO====) emissions and environmental damages of about $1.7 billion. These effects are likely to be bigger in the longer run.====Insofar as it focuses on households' choices for fuel efficiency at the extensive margin and how such choices are affected by gasoline prices, our paper relates to the large literature on automobile demand and the compositional effect, including Allcott and Wozny, 2016, Austin and Terry, 2005, Bento et al., 2009, Busse et al., 2013, Feng et al., 2013, Gillingham, 2012, Goldberg, 1998, Jacobsen, 2013, Klier and Linn, 2010, Li et al., 2014, Li et al., 2009, Puller and Greening, 1999; and Sallee et al. (2016). Overall, this literature has found that an increase in gasoline prices increases the demand for more fuel-efficient cars, which in equilibrium modestly nudges the composition of the automobile fleet toward fuel efficiency. In particular, new cars entering the fleet become more fuel efficient while older inefficient cars are scrapped more rapidly. Interestingly, Allcott and Wozny, 2016, Busse et al., 2013; and Sallee et al. (2016) find that, between production and scrappage, the shift in demand manifests in price rather than quantity effects, with the prices of fuel-efficient used cars rising relative to inefficient cars when gas prices rise. Our work can be viewed as exploring the heterogeneity in these demand effects at the extensive margin, showing that they are larger for (exogenously) higher-utilization households than lower-utilization households. In equilibrium, this gives rise to more assortative matching, which in turn becomes a third channel through which gas prices affect gasoline consumption.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section II explains the matching effect using a theoretical model; Section III introduces the basic empirical approach and describes the data; Section IV presents the results and briefly discusses the implications; and Section V concludes.",Fuel consumption and gasoline prices: The role of assortative matching between households and automobiles,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069618301761,May 2019,2019,Research Article,336.0

This paper tests if temperature anomalies around the time of birth can have ==== impacts on individuals' economic productivity. Using unique data sets on historical weather and earnings, place and date of birth of all 1.5 million formal employees in Ecuador, we find that individuals who have experienced in-utero temperatures that are 1 °C above average are less educated and earn about 0.7% less as adults. Results are robust to alternative specifications and falsification tests and suggest that warming may have already caused adverse long-term economic impacts.","Growing interest in the future impacts of climate change has spurred a burgeoning literature on the economic impacts of high temperatures. Multiple analyses of historical weather and socio-economic data have now produced a substantial body of robust evidence that high temperature anomalies lead to a range of adverse, ==== social, economic and health impacts (see Dell et al., 2012; Deschenes, 2014; Carleton and Hsiang, 2016, for a review, and section 2), including on the health of fetuses and infants (Zivin and Shrader, 2016).====Another, independent body of evidence establishes the long-term impacts of early life stress on adult socio-economic indicators, health and well-being. In particular, the ==== posits that in-utero circumstances can have substantial long-term impacts on human development. Numerous studies have provided evidence in support of this hypothesis, finding that economic, environmental, or disease-related stress in infancy or in-utero lead to long-term impacts on physical and cognitive health and educational attainment (Almond and Currie, 2011). When combined with the evidence on the multiple socio-economic and health related impacts of high temperature anomalies, this suggests that individuals who are exposed to high ambient temperatures in-utero or in infancy may experience life-long and long-term negative consequences through a number of possible channels, both physiological and economic. Such long-term impacts are by no means an obvious and un-preventable biological outcome, given the possibility of parental or other responses may serve to ameliorate them (for example, Yi et al., 2015). Since economic theory suggests that wages provide an accurate indicator of economic productivity and human capital encompassing physical and cognitive function, a powerful test of this hypothesis can be conducted by examining the association between early life temperature anomalies and adult earnings.====A recent paper by Isen et al. (2017) finds evidence for exactly such an association among 30-year individuals in the U.S. born between 1969 and 1977. Here, we examine the same hypothesis in a very different context: individuals born between 1950 and 1979 in Ecuador, a middle-income country with very different physical and socio-economic characteristics.==== Our analysis makes use of a unique data set on the 2010 earnings of all 1 million formal sector workers above the age of 30 for which earnings were reported to the Ecuadorian tax authority. This data was merged with civil registry data to identify the place and time of birth of these individuals, and then merged with historical weather data sets to identify temperature and precipitation levels around the time of birth (including the 9 months while in-utero, and the 9-month period following birth).====We find that higher temperatures in-utero lead to significantly lower adult earnings, with a 1 °C increase in average monthly temperature in-utero leading to about a 0.7% decrease in adult earnings of both men and women, even though the effects on women are somewhat larger (0.9% vs. 0.6%). In contrast, the temperature in the corresponding 9-month period after birth shows no impact on adult earnings. These results are highly robust to the inclusion of fine geographic controls, localized annual cycles and time trends, and to various falsification tests. Since these estimates are derived from random, unexpected deviations of monthly temperatures from local, long-term means and trends, we can rule out the possibility that confounding variables are driving the association. Thus, even though the reduced-form analysis does not allow us to identify which of the multiple established negative impacts of high temperatures are driving the association, the random nature of temperature variations over time within a geographical locality facilitates causal inference (Dell et al., 2012).====The negative impacts found in this paper and by Isen et al. (2017) across two drastically different geographical and economic contexts lends both sets of results with remarkable external validity. During the respective study periods, G.D.P. per capita was about ten times as high in the U.S. as it was in Ecuador, and this was also reflected in important mediating factors such as access to health care and electricity and the composition of the labor force. That both populations suffer long-term effects of elevated temperatures suggests that such impacts may be phenomena of global relevance. This in turn, makes additional studies of such associations in diverse settings of even greater importance.====Differences in the patterns of impacts observed in different contexts are also important to document, as they may help to begin and illuminate the mechanisms driving the association, which both papers are unable to adequately do owing to their reduced-form approach. Isen et al. (2017) are mainly motivated by (limited) medical indications of the health impacts of elevated temperatures on fetuses and infants and the observed reduced-form impacts on birth weight in the U.S. (Deschenes et al., 2009), but recognize that additional channels could be at play. In a developing country context, in particular, economic mechanisms such as those operating through agricultural or non-agricultural incomes, or through the spread of endemic infectious disease, for example, are potentially important (see section 2 for a fuller discussion). Moreover, coping strategies may be more limited. This could potentially explain differences in the size of the impacts found by Isen et al. (2017) and by us. Even though differences in empirical approaches make a direct comparison difficult, we find indications that suggest impacts in Ecuador are substantially higher (although the differences are not statistically precise).====Studies that track cohorts that reach adulthood during rapid phases of economic growth and industrialization, such as the present one, are particularly interesting. Previous work (Maccini and Yang, 2009) has already shown that early life income shocks can impact adult outcomes amongst low-income populations that remain rural and agricultural. But less is known about the degree to which economic growth can help reduce some of these impacts, i.e. whether individuals who hail from rural, low income households will avoid experiencing long-term impacts if they integrate into a more industrial, formal economy and benefit from the associated amenities. Our results suggest this is not the case. Understanding these dynamics is also highly relevant for understanding the implications for future economic growth in an era of rapid industrialization and climate change.====As important as studies in low or middle-income countries are, however, they are also more challenging to conduct, owing to methodological and data issues. First, fine-grained weather data of sufficient coverage is much harder to obtain (Auffhammer et al., 2013). Second, reliable (especially administrative) data on earnings is rarely available. Even when it is, it will typically be available for a fraction of the labor force (e.g. formal sector), which raises issues of sample selection. Our analysis attempts to address these issues in ways that we hope will be useful for additional studies that investigate this phenomena in other developing countries.====Like Isen et al. (2017), this paper contributes to a growing literature investigating the implications of exogenous early life weather shocks on children and adults outcomes, pioneered by Maccini and Yang (2009). Most of these papers focus on the impacts of early life rainfall shocks on rural farming populations, and find evidence of impacts on the health, consumption, and education of adult women in Indonesia (Maccini and Yang, 2009), the health and cognitive abilities of Mexican (Aguilar and Vicarelli, 2011) and Nepali (Tiwari et al., 2013) adolescents, among others.====The findings of both papers add to the existing literature in several ways. First, we are able to estimate long-run impacts on adult economic productivity using administrative earnings data, a first in a developing country setting as far as we are aware.==== Most papers that have found effects on human capital accumulation were unable to map these to reductions in earnings. Second, our sample consists of individuals who are better educated, more urbanized and have higher incomes than in previous studies in developing countries. Indeed, all of the individuals in our sample are employed in the formal sector of a middle-income country, whereas samples in most previous studies consisted mainly of farming households.====Third, while most previous studies are focused on rainfall shocks, this study documents the long-term impacts of high temperature shocks. Our analysis therefore adds a novel result to the growing literature on the economic and welfare impacts of elevated temperatures and climate change, which has thus far mostly focused on short-term impacts. Our results are consistent with a small number of other studies that have found detrimental short-term impacts of high temperatures in-utero on post-birth health outcomes (see section 2). However, we extend these results by directly observing much longer-term economic impacts of high temperatures.",Long-term impacts of exposure to high temperatures on human capital and economic productivity,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069618301098,January 2019,2019,Research Article,337.0

Results from our laboratory experiments show that contributions to a linear PG are higher if the externality is framed positively, rather than negatively, corroborating earlier findings by Andreoni (1995). By contrast, we find no such framing effects in the non-linear PG game or the CPR game. In these games, the best response in the material payoffs is to contribute less if others contribute more, counteracting effects of pro-social preferences. Positive framing therefore does not help to solve the tragedy of the commons.","Social dilemmas – a misalignment of individual and group interests – are the root cause of many environmental problems. Cooperation can attenuate such dilemmas, depending on how the game is framed, the marginal benefits of cooperation and how those benefits are shared (van Soest et al., 2016; Apesteguia and Maier-Rigaud, 2006). Andreoni (1995) showed in a seminal study that contributions in a public goods (PG) game were much lower if the identical game was framed in terms of a ==== externality (i.e. a public bad) rather than the standard ==== frame (i.e. a public good). He speculated that “the warm glow of contributing must [hence] be stronger than the cold-prickle of imposing cost on others”. Further, he pointed out that cooperation is common in public goods games, but rare in oligopoly and common pool resource games, the framing being a salient difference: “It is possible that this difference alone could be generating at least some of the gap between these two bodies of experimental results.” (Andreoni, 1995, p.2).====The main goal of this paper is to test whether reframing the common pool resource (CPR) game as a positive externality – not harvesting benefits others – increases cooperation. While the PG and the CPR games are both social dilemmas, they also differ in aspects that might influence the effect of framing. First, in the standard linear PG game, the material incentives to contribute are independent of the contribution of others. As pointed out by van Soest et al. (2016), the marginal per capita return (MPCR)==== is therefore constant. In a CPR game, however, the MPCR decreases as more players are cooperative. This means that being selfish is most beneficial if many co-players cooperate, and choices are strategic substitutes in the material domain.==== Second, in the PG game the fruits of cooperation are shared equally among group members – independent of who has contributed. By contrast, the rivalry component of the CPR game implies that benefits are disproportionally reaped by non-cooperative individuals.==== If a player is “kind” and harvests little, the ones who benefit the most from this kindness are the unkind players who themselves harvest the most.====How do these properties of ==== and ==== influence the effect of framing in social dilemmas? To answer this question, we run six different treatments. The first two treatments are a positive and negative framing of the linear PG game similar to that of Andreoni (1995). The next two are a positive and negative framing of the CPR game. Lastly, as a CPR game differs from a linear PG along two dimensions, we also run a positive and negative framing of a non-linear PG game that features strategic substitutes, but no rivalry. In all three games (PG, CPR and non-linear PG) participants are asked to make two active choices: invest a certain endowment of money either in a “kind” account (labeled account A) or in an “unkind” account (labeled account B).==== The two frames of each of the three games are economically equivalent. In the positive framing, instructions highlight that an investment in account A will make group members better off, essentially posing a positive externality. The negative framing emphasizes that an investment in account B will make other group members worse off, essentially posing a negative externality.====Framing effects in these dilemmas may occur for (at least) two reasons. First, players may hold different preferences for imposing positive or negative externalities on others, as suggested by Andreoni (1995). In such a case, we should observe a framing effect in all games. Second, framing effects may be due to beliefs about behavior of others (Ellingsen et al., 2012; Fosgaard et al., 2014). In the positive frame, the positive externality – good behavior – is highlighted. As a result, individuals may be more inclined to believe that others will cooperate.==== With pro-social preferences, multiple equilibria can emerge and the frame may serve as a coordination device.====Our main finding from the experimental investigation is that positive framing increases cooperation in the linear PG game, but has no significant effect in the non-linear version of the PG and the CPR game. We therefore reject the conjecture that positive framing generally increases cooperation in social dilemmas. We discuss several behavioral models and mechanisms that may explain why a framing effect only occurs in the linear PG game. In particular, we discuss how strategic substitution in material payoffs may counteract a framing effect stemming from different social preferences.====Our paper adds to the experimental literature testing under which conditions positive or negative framing effects cooperation in social dilemmas.==== Park (2000) combines Andreoni's framing experiment with eliciting value-orientation, highlighting that the framing effect is more pronounced for some personality types than for others. Along similar lines, Sonnemans et al. (1998) have framed two strategically equivalent games as a public good or public bad game with discrete stepwise cooperation levels, also eliciting value orientation and beliefs. They find contributions to the public good to be higher than to the public bad, consistent with Andreoni (1995). Fujimoto and Park (2010) replicated Andreoni's findings looking particularly at gender effects and found that framing effects are slightly weaker for females.==== Willinger and Ziegelmeyer (1999) have replicated Andreoni's key findings with a non-linear version of the public goods game. They find a framing effect, while we find no framing effect for the non-linear PG game. A potential explanation for this difference is that in Willinger and Ziegelmeyer (1999), the non-linearity lies in the private payoff function, while the social optimum is still to allocate everything to the public good. Hence, there is no strategic substitution in the monetary domain in their model, while in ours there is.====This paper is organized as follows.

We review how the literature identifies leakage and the pollution haven effect. We then evaluate whether EU ETS emission costs caused carbon leakage in European manufacturing, using trade flows in embodied carbon and value from the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP). We find no evidence that the EU ETS caused carbon leakage.","Climate change caused by CO==== emissions is a global problem, but efforts to reduce CO==== emissions are mostly regional. In Europe and in some states in the U.S., for example, policy initiatives exist, but no binding international agreement is in force.==== Unilateral, geographically limited policies increase production costs for domestic producers who compete internationally with producers from unregulated regions. This asymmetry raises the fear of carbon leakage – a shift of CO==== emissions from a region with emission constraints to an unregulated area, ==== a change in relative competitiveness in an open global economy. Carbon leakage is a concern both in the academic debate and in policy circles (Ellerman et al., 2016). As climate change depends on aggregate global emissions, carbon leakage threatens to undo the effects of unilateral policy efforts.==== If carbon leakage occurs, the region implementing the policy suffers from a decrease in output and a consequent loss in employment and welfare, additionally to an ineffective environmental policy. The issue is particularly salient when manufacturing sectors are affected by an emissions policy, as they often produce goods that are both carbon intensive and heavily traded.====In this paper, we ask whether the EU ETS, the most important unilateral emissions policy to date, has caused carbon leakage in European manufacturing sectors. More specifically, we test if (parts of) the evolution of sectoral trade intensities can be explained by the stringency of environmental policy. Our empirical analysis in this paper does not provide any evidence of carbon leakage during our sample period, from 2004 to 2011.====In theory, carbon leakage occurs between a domestic region featuring an emissions policy and a foreign region with no policy or a less stringent policy. It results from the combination of two effects: (i) relocation, when domestic firms shift their production to foreign countries to evade the increased production cost imposed by the environmental policy; and (ii) changes in market shares, when domestic firms lose market share to unregulated foreign competitors, who become more competitive as they do not have to bear the additional cost burden.==== Both effects translate directly into trade flows: for a given level of domestic consumption of a carbon-intensive product, carbon leakage leads to a higher share of imports in total consumption of the home region and to lower exports.====In practice, the case for carbon leakage is not clear cut. First, the difference in emission cost between Europe and emerging economies has so far been moderate, in particular relative to differences in labor cost. Labor unit cost in Europe is about 10–30 times higher than in emerging countries (Schröder, 2016). Even though the emission cost is typically zero in other parts of the world, our data show that the emission cost imposed by the EU ETS is below 0.65% of total material cost for 95 percent of European manufacturing. Thus, the additional cost introduced by European emissions policy is comparatively small. Second, firms relocating production to a foreign region must pay fixed relocation costs. Relocation also has opportunity costs in the home market, such as a weaker market position and less influence in bargaining with policy makers. Third, emissions policies often combine costs and subsidies. Within the EU ETS, European manufacturing firms received large amounts of free emissions allowances (“free allocation”), which may be sufficient to counter the leakage risk (EU, 2014; Schmidt and Heitzig, 2014).==== Our data reveal that most sectors received a ==== from emissions trading, once free allocation is taken into account. Fourth, the management literature predicts an inverse effect of environmental regulation (Porter hypothesis): the negative competitiveness effects of unilateral environmental policy may be offset by successful incentives to innovate in lower-carbon products, spurring a broader productivity increase for firms affected by environmental policies (Porter and Van der Linde, 1995). Innovation may be incentivized through the emission price signal (Calel and Dechezleprêtre, 2016) or by providing explicit R&D subsidies in parallel (Acemoglu et al., 2012; Aghion et al., 2016).====Our empirical analysis is based on the argument that leakage can be measured through ==== in trade flows, as they include both leakage channels: production relocation away from Europe and loss of European firms' market shares. We create a dataset of global trade flows, emission costs and control variables by combining data from the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) with data from the EU's Transaction Log (EUTL), the administration's repository of data on emissions, allocations of allowances and transactions in the EU ETS. While GTAP is frequently used for research on computable general equilibrium models, it has recently also been used for empirical research on international trade (Caron et al., 2014). Brunnermeier and Levinson (2004) stress the importance of using panel data, as we do in this study, to account for unobserved heterogeneity of sectors and trading partners. We estimate the effect of four potential measures of the EU ETS's stringency on trade flows in European manufacturing. Our measures of policy stringency account for both direct and indirect emission costs. Indirect emission cost arises from electricity use: industrial consumers of electricity pay at least part of the costs of embodied emissions, as power producers pass through their emission cost to wholesale prices of electricity (Fabra and Reguant, 2014; Hintermann, 2016). We use two measures of trade: first, we compute CO==== emissions embodied in the traded goods (“embodied carbon”), and second we use trade value in U.S. dollars. Embodied carbon is computed from input-output tables and measures the CO==== emissions necessary to produce the traded goods. Trade flows in embodied carbon are often not available, but they capture carbon leakage better than trade flows in value. In our analysis we follow two approaches suggested by the literature: a traditional approach focusing on net imports (Ederington et al., 2005; Levinson and Taylor, 2008) and an approach in the spirit of New trade theory where we evaluate bilateral (two-way) trade flows (Aichele and Felbermayr, 2012, 2015).====We find no evidence for carbon leakage in European manufacturing sectors during our sample period 2004–2011. This result contrasts with predictions from ex ante modeling exercises, but is largely in line with findings from existing empirical research on the carbon leakage hypothesis in the context of the EU ETS.====Given the policy relevance of the leakage issue, a sizable literature, mostly based on ex ante computable general equilibrium (CGE) models, has attempted to predict the extent of carbon leakage from existing policy initiatives and potential modifications (as reviewed by Branger and Quirion, 2014; Carbone and Rivers, 2017). These ex ante approaches predict strong carbon leakage with leakage rates between 10% and 30% (Carbone and Rivers, 2017; IPCC, 2007).==== However, the predictions of ex ante approaches depend on model assumptions, e.g. whether the model includes relocation costs, and the implementation details of the considered emissions policy. Demailly and Quirion (2006) show that introducing output-based allocation in the EU ETS would eliminate leakage, at the cost of decreasing the incentive for producers to abate emissions. Gerlagh and Kuik (2014) show that allowing for technology spill-overs may even lead to carbon leakage from foreign countries into the EU.====Empirical ==== evidence on carbon leakage is limited. Much of the existing empirical literature considers the pollution haven effect in the U.S., i.e. the effect of increasing the stringency of local pollution regulation on trade flows. These contributions typically test for a link between net trade flows and the stringency of pollution control measures, as captured by the Pollution Abatement Cost (PAC) using survey data of U.S. manufacturers.==== The evidence in this literature is mixed. Jaffe et al. (1995) review the early contributions, and conclude that there is little evidence that environmental policy has affected trade flows; like other authors, they point to the relatively small magnitudes of environmental expenditures as an explanation. Dechezleprêtre and Sato (2017) review the more recent literature and conclude that there is some evidence in favor of the pollution haven hypothesis, even if the cost burden is small. In particular, Ederington et al. (2005) and Levinson and Taylor (2008) regress U.S. net imports on PAC and find that environmental policy did impact U.S. trade flows. Aichele and Felbermayr (2015) find a carbon leakage effect of the Kyoto protocol. Based on a “gravity model for carbon” they find that the carbon content of sector-level bilateral trade was significantly impacted by a country's ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. However, it remains unclear through which channel the Kyoto protocol has induced this effect.====To our knowledge, the carbon leakage hypothesis in the EU ETS has so far not been comprehensively evaluated empirically. Some research addresses the relocation channel: Dechezleprêtre et al. (2014) use a survey of multinational firms and find no evidence that the EU ETS induced the relocation of emission-intensive processes ==== multinational firms. Other research addresses the investment channel: using firm-level data on foreign direct investment (FDI) by German multinational companies, Koch and Basse Mama (2016) find no evidence that the EU ETS has contributed to relocation through an increase in outbound FDI. Martin et al. (2014) conduct a survey of managers; they find that relocation risk is limited and that the current EU ETS rules largely over-compensate many sectors given the small risk of relocation. Finally, one strand of literature examines trade flows in specific sectors: Sartor (2013) finds that the EU ETS has not caused carbon leakage in the aluminum sector, while Branger et al. (2016) find no leakage in the cement and steel sector.====We contribute to the literature in several ways: first, we assess both the relocation and the competitiveness impact of the EU ETS by using global sector-level trade data. This approach complements studies focusing on relocation using firm-level data, e.g. Martin et al. (2014) or Dechezleprêtre et al. (2014). Second, using a broader dataset and focusing on a particular policy initiative whose cost can be captured explicitly, we complement previous work on carbon leakage effects of unilateral climate policy. Third, the input-output information in our data allows us to consider all embodied emissions in our outcome variable (trade flows) and our policy variable (emission policy), i.e. both direct emissions and indirect emissions from electricity use.====In the following, we first review the relevant trade theory in Section 2 and then present our empirical implementation in Section 3. This is followed by a description of the data in Section 4 and presentation of results in Section 5. We summarize and conclude in Section 6.",Does the EU ETS cause carbon leakage in European manufacturing?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069617306836,January 2019,2019,Research Article,339.0

A 10% increase in the surface area of ==== protected areas (==== lands) allows an estimated 9.32 sq. km (10.08 sq. km) of avoided deforestation.,"Tropical forests are home to the most biodiverse ecosystems and provide a host of ecosystem services (e.g. Wearn et al., 2012). They play a crucial role in ecological, climate and biogeochemical processes as well as in preserving human livelihoods. However anthropogenic actions increasingly disrupt forest structure, function, and composition (Lewis et al., 2015). For instance the loss of tropical forest is a key factor in climate change. Curbing deforestation is a crucial question in Brazil where the deforestation rates were relatively higher than in other Latin American countries between 2001 and 2010 (Aide et al., 2013). Yet deforestation in the Brazilian Amazônia rainforest declined steadily from 2004 to 2010, and since then, until 2014, it has been about 5800 square kilometers per year according to INPE.==== Deforestation has experienced an impressive 79% decrease with respect to the 28,000 square kilometers peak in 2004.====A range of reasons for the decline of deforestation in Brazil have been put forward, including the 2008–2009 financial crisis (Nepstad et al., 2009), and conservation policies enforced in recent years by the Brazilian authorities which mainly relied on the implementation of protected areas (Assuncao et al., 2012; Hargrave and Kis-Katos, 2012; Nolte et al., 2013; Palmer and di Falco, 2012 among others). The surface area of protected areas (PAs) in the Brazilian Legal Amazônia doubled between 2000 and 2009, and today amounts to 2 million square kilometers representing 42% of its surface. Fig. 1 shows a negative correlation between protected and deforested areas in Brazil. However this correlation may be misleading and other determinants of the slowdown in deforestation might have played a substantial role (e.g. Nepstad et al., 2014; Macedo et al., 2012). Thus further analysis is needed to investigate the impact of PAs on deforestation. This is the topic of this paper.====A wealth of literature has been devoted to the effects of PAs. Robalino (2007) theoretically shows that PAs induce distributional effects through changes in rents and wages. Most other articles empirically analyze PAs efficiency to curb deforestation, taking into account the location bias or the spillover effects. Empirical studies that have examined the impact of PAs on deforestation have shown that their ecological characteristics (level of rainfall, slope, and surface temperature) as well as their types (belonging or not to indigenous populations, integral versus sustainable PAs) matter in the process of deforestation (see among others, Deininger and Minten (2002) for Chiapas and Oaxaca in Mexico, Mertens et al. (2002) for the case of São Félix do Xingú in South Pará in the Brazilian Amazônia and Mertens et al. (2004) for Santa Cruz in Bolivia).==== The efficiency of PAs on deforestation is subject to debate because PAs are not randomly distributed (Gaston et al., 2008; Gaveau et al., 2009). They are usually located on lands with characteristics that do not favor agricultural expansion, owing to low soil fertility, slope, poor accessibility, and so forth (Albers and Ferraro, 2006). Neglecting this location bias could induce an overestimation of the impact of PAs on deforestation (Kéré et al., 2017; Joppa and Pfaff, 2009; Nepstad et al., 2006; Sanchez-Azofeifa et al., 2003).====The location bias has been addressed either with matching methods (Andam et al., 2008; Gaveau et al., 2009; Pfaff et al., 2009, 2014, 2015a, 2015b) or bivariate probit models (Cropper et al., 2001). For example, Pfaff et al. (2015a) show that PAs in the Brazilian Amazônia do significantly lower deforestation within their boundaries during 2000–2008 period. As PAs are biased towards lands that are facing lower clearing threat, their matching estimates impacts are only half as large as the simplest estimates. Moreover integral PAs' impacts are greater than impacts of sustainable PAs in the arc of deforestation (Pfaff et al., 2015b). Yet, those papers share a common distinctive feature: they take into account the location bias but they overlook spatial spillover effects between deforestation areas.====Several papers draw attention to the indirect land use changes generated by environmental policies. They focus on displacement or leakage effects induced by land use change (Meyfroidt et al., 2013; Soares-Filho et al., 2010): agriculture encroaches on grazing lands which are moved towards forests' frontiers. This phenomenon might be of crucial importance since it could wipe out benefits from the voluntary moratoriums of soy producers on forest conversion (Arima et al., 2011) as well the mitigation efforts brought by biofuel programs (Lapola et al., 2010). As examplified by Andrade de Sá et al. (2013) there is a positive relationship between sugarcane expansion in the São Paulo state and deforestation in the Amazônia from 1970 to 2006.====Spatial deforestation spillovers have already attracted attention. In Costa Rica, Robalino and Pfaff (2012) focus on neighborhoods defined by distance regardless of political boundaries and find that neighboring deforestation significantly raises the probability of deforestation. They conclude that these effects have to be taken into account in addressing forest conservation policies. Using fine scale data, Robalino et al. (2017) address deforestation spillovers from Costa-Rican PAs. They find leakage effects close to roads in areas without tourism whereas no leakage is found far from roads and in areas affected by tourism. According to Oliveira et al. (2007), PAs could cause leakages in deforestation in the Peruvian Amazônia. If restricting the land-use reduced the level of human impacts, there was a dramatic increase in deforestation rates outside the landscapes surrounding the forest concessions. A couple of empirical studies have shown that there are strategic interactions between municipalities regarding deforestation decisions. More precisely, deforestation decisions seem to be strategic complements in the Legal Amazônia as underlined by Aguiar et al. (2007) and Igliori (2006).====Our paper focuses on the municipality cross-border effects generated by different types of PAs on deforestation. It takes into account both the location bias of PAs and strategic interactions between municipalities within a broad geographical area, i.e. the Brazilian Legal Amazônia. It also provides a theoretical framework to understand how these spillover effects could occur.====The salient features of our study are the following. First, the theoretical analysis shows that due to the infrastructure effect, deforestation decisions are strategic complements. In this case, establishing a PA in one municipality enables a reduction of deforestation in nearby municipalities, even if the latter do not implement PAs. Second, the empirical analysis is conducted using a geo-referenced database of land use in the Brazilian Legal Amazônia over the period 2001–2009 at municipal level. The spatial interdependences in deforestation as well as cross-border effects of PAs are evidenced using a Dynamic Spatial Durbin Model. This empirical framework delivers differentiated effects of PAs according to their management type. Contrary to sustainable areas, integral PAs and indigenous lands allow for reductions in deforestation. Moreover, the spillover effects generated by integral PAs and indigenous lands help to reduce deforestation in the vicinity.====The rest of this article is organized as follows.

We investigate the effects of these two aspects of perceived consequentiality on stated preferences in a field survey concerning renewable energy development in Poland. We find that beliefs in policy and payment consequentiality strengthen the respondents’ interest in having the project implemented. However, policy consequentiality decreases and payment consequentiality increases their sensitivity to the project cost, which, respectively, increases and decreases their willingness-to-pay for the project. We conclude that the two aspects of consequentiality should be addressed separately. Additionally, we inquire the theoretically speculated links between the respondents’ perceptions of policy and payment consequentiality and their risk attitudes, and we find no significant relationship.","Designing stated preference surveys to make them incentive-compatible (that is, to make the surveys provide rational respondents with a dominant strategy to reveal their preferences truthfully; Carson and Groves, 2007) has become a widely recommended practice in the literature. It constitutes one of the state-of-the-art guidelines for stated preference research (Johnston et al., 2017) and has been empirically shown to improve the validity of value estimates derived from stated preference surveys (Zawojska and Czajkowski, 2017). This points to the robustness of implied preference and willingness-to-pay measures when incentive-compatibility of a survey is assured.====Making a stated preference survey incentive-compatible entails satisfying a set of conditions. Out of them, the one that is presumably the least arguable is the survey consequentiality. The recent guidelines for stated preference research (Johnston et al., 2017) define consequentiality based on its two elements. These are a positive probability, as faced or perceived by respondents, that their responses will affect decisions related to the outcome in question (henceforth, policy consequentiality) and a positive probability that respondents will have to pay for that outcome if it is introduced (henceforth, payment consequentiality).====Despite broad empirical evidence on the important role of consequentiality for truthful preference elicitation, little is known about the correct ways to measure and influence respondents’ beliefs with respect to consequentiality (Kling et al., 2012). Moreover, existing research barely differentiates between the effects of policy and payment consequentiality on stated preferences, commonly treating consequentiality as a uniform concept.====The effects of survey consequentiality on stated preferences are inquired in various ways. Some studies define a probability with which a survey’s outcome will be binding and examine the influence of this probability on the respondents’ behavior (e.g., Mitani and Flores, 2012; Carson et al., 2014). Some verify how respondents’ stated preferences change when scripts that inform about a survey’s consequential character are included or excluded (e.g., Bulte et al., 2005). Other studies query respondents explicitly about their beliefs concerning survey consequentiality and check whether their stated preferences differ in these perceptions (e.g., Nepal et al., 2009; Broadbent et al., 2010; Vossler et al., 2012). Typically, these studies refer to consequentiality in general, without differentiating between policy and payment consequentiality.====In this paper, we aim to deepen the understanding of the role of consequentiality in stated preference surveys by distinguishing between the impacts of self-perceived policy and payment consequentiality on the respondents’ behavior. Our study contributes to the existing literature by addressing the following two issues.====First, in earlier studies, respondents’ perceptions about consequentiality are typically elicited through a single question, such as how strongly respondents believe that the survey’s outcome will be used for future policy purposes. Instead, we ask respondents about beliefs concerning policy and payment consequentiality separately. Researchers doubt whether the commonly used single question captures these beliefs satisfactorily (Kling et al., 2012; Czajkowski et al., 2017b). In surveys, respondents are asked to indicate the strength of their consequentiality beliefs on a Likert scale ranging from two (Broadbent et al., 2010; Broadbent, 2012) to several levels (e.g., Herriges et al., 2010; Vossler et al., 2012). Following this practice, we include five levels. Additionally, we investigate where the respondents who answer “I do not know/Hard to say” to the consequentiality questions should be located on the Likert scale; for example, in the middle or at any of its ends. To the best of our knowledge, none of the earlier field studies distinguishes the effects of the respondents’ beliefs concerning policy and payment consequentiality on stated preferences.====Second, we empirically verify a claim suggested in previous theoretical work that, for truthful preference revelation, not only the positive strength levels of the beliefs concerning policy and payment consequentiality matter (a so-called knife-edge result)==== but also the relation between the two levels, namely, which belief is stronger/weaker (Mitani and Flores, 2014). The impact of this relation on the truthfulness of preference disclosure is hypothesized to vary depending on a respondent’s risk attitude. We empirically test the influence of a respondent’s risk attitude on stated preferences and examine the correlation of risk attitudes with beliefs concerning policy and payment consequentiality.====We investigate these issues in a field study of preferences toward development of renewable energy infrastructure. Our baseline model focuses on the influence of perceptions of policy and payment consequentiality on stated preferences. We apply a hybrid mixed logit framework as per Czajkowski et al. (2017b) in order to incorporate self-reported measures of the beliefs into the econometric modeling of preferences, while addressing the potential problem of measurement errors and accounting for the ordinal nature of the measures expressed on the Likert scale. The unobservable beliefs concerning policy and payment consequentiality are modeled as latent variables. Our supplement model additionally includes a latent variable related to the respondents’ (unobservable) risk attitudes, measured in the survey as a count variable related to the number of choices of risky lotteries, as per Tanaka et al. (2010). This allows us to test the role of risk attitudes for stated preferences and for beliefs concerning consequentiality.====The remaining paper is structured as follows. The next section reviews the literature on consequentiality in stated preference research. Section 3 provides details about the survey instrument employed for data collection. Section 4 outlines the econometric approach we use for modeling preferences and for linking them with unobservable consequentiality perceptions and risk attitudes. Section 5 presents the results of the empirical analysis.

We compute the potential benefits of regulating groundwater use by comparing the net benefits of groundwater under optimal management to the net benefits under a common pool regime with two different cost structures: one with flat electricity tariffs, which are widespread in India, and a second with full marginal cost electricity pricing. Using numerical simulation, we find that the opportunity to invest in deeper wells significantly exacerbates the common pool problem and suggests the potential for large benefits (66% of common pool benefits) from optimally managing groundwater use or new drilling. Flat tariffs exacerbate the problem, but large gains (almost 23%) remain even if farms are charged the full marginal cost of electricity.","Over the past fifty years, the use of groundwater for irrigation has dramatically increased in developing countries like India and China (Siebert et al., 2010). Increased groundwater irrigation has enabled higher and more consistent crop yields, which in turn has improved food security and reduced poverty (Rosegrant and Cline, 2003). However, this increase in groundwater use has led to falling water levels and widespread concern about the long-term sustainability of irrigated agriculture (Hanjra and Qureshi, 2010).====These concerns are especially dire in India, where groundwater use has increased by 500% over the past fifty years (Garduño and Foster, 2010). The Central Groundwater Board of India estimates that fifteen percent of the administrative blocks in India extract more water than is replenished (Central Ground Water Board, 2014) and there is significant concern about rapid depletion (Narula et al., 2011; Shah, 2012; Mukherji et al., 2013; Fishman et al., 2017). Evidence suggests these dropping groundwater levels have increased poverty and conflict and decreased agricultural profits (Sekhri, 2013a, 2014).====On one level, this pattern of falling groundwater levels is not surprising economically, since groundwater is a common pool resource and is likely to be overused in the absence of mechanisms to restrict usage. On the other hand, these concerns about overuse are in direct contrast with much of the groundwater economics literature, which finds that the size of the common pool externality is relatively small in real world scenarios. This result, first identified by Gisser and Sanchez (1980), suggests that while groundwater levels may be falling faster than optimal, the resulting welfare losses are negligible. This result has been termed the Gisser-Sanchez effect and has been found empirically to hold in a diverse array of contexts (Koundouri, 2004; Pfeiffer and Lin, 2012; Lin Lawell, 2016; Sears and Lin Lawell, 2018).====In this paper, we explore this apparent contradiction between the economic theory and the reality on the ground in India. We construct a Gisser-Sanchez style model that includes three critical features of the groundwater situation in India: first, that changes in well capacity, rather than the cost of extraction, are the primary impact of reduced water levels on farmers; second, that well capacity can be increased through endogenous investment in well deepening and stronger pumps; and third, that subsidized flat electricity tariffs exacerbate the common pool externality. We then parameterize our model using numbers that fit the arid alluvial aquifer region of Northwest India and estimate the size of the externality losses.====Our model differs from the typical groundwater model in that farmers who behave “myopically” with respect to the impact of their pumping on future groundwater levels still face a dynamic investment problem regarding their decisions about well investment. We thus compare an optimal management regime in which both groundwater pumping and well investment decisions are made optimally, to an unregulated common pool regime in which individual farmers ignore the impact of their pumping on future water levels, but make decisions about well investments based on rational expectations about future groundwater levels.====We find that instituting optimal management increases the present value of the social net benefit of irrigation by 66%, relative to the common pool situation with flat electricity tariffs. Approximately half this gain could be realized by replacing the flat tariffs with marginal cost pricing of electricity, but we estimate that optimal management will increase the benefits relative to a common pool regime with real electricity costs by almost 23%, still a sizable gain. We further assess the impact of several specific parameters on our results and find that differences in the estimated gains remain non-negligible across a wide variety of parameter values.====Our paper contributes to the literature that investigates the robustness of the Gisser-Sanchez effect to changes in the model. While much of the work has confirmed the Gisser-Sanchez result, several notable exceptions identify larger gains to management. These include Brill and Burness (1994) who incorporate increasing demand, declining well yields, and low social discount rates, Koundouri and Christou (2006) who consider an aquifer close to depletion without a viable backstop, Tsur and Zemel (1995, 2004) who consider the buffer value of groundwater in the presence of uncertainty and the possibility of irreversible damage, and Guilfoos et al. (2013) who simulate a spatially explicit aquifer and find relatively large (27%) gains from management if farmers behave myopically. Other authors have focused on investments or adaptations farmers may make to reduce groundwater use. Burness and Brill (2001) consider investment in efficient irrigation technology and Kim et al. (1989) look at changes in the mix of crops grown over time. Both studies confirm the Gisser-Sanchez result, finding small inefficiencies under the common pool regime. Instead of analyzing investments or adaptations that reduce the demand for water, we focus on a lumpy investment decision that mitigates the impact of falling water levels on farmers.====We also contribute to a growing literature on the importance of well capacity for understanding the implications of groundwater depletion. Brill and Burness (1994) provide early evidence that declines in well yield as water levels fall can lead to large gains from management. More recently, Foster et al. (2014; 2015a; 2015b) emphasize the importance of well capacity for intra-annual decisions about crop choices. Manning and Suter (2016) include the effect of neighbors on well capacity in a spatially explicit three cell aquifer for a basin in Colorado and find small gains from management (2%) when farmers behave optimally.==== We extend this work by applying the ideas in a developing country context and incorporating the option to overcome reductions in well capacity through investment in deeper wells and stronger pumps.====Our paper also contributes to the literature on the groundwater situation in India. Msangi and Cline (2016) analyze groundwater policy options and estimate small percentage gains from groundwater management in the hard-rock aquifer region of southern India. Previous work has analyzed how subsidized, flat electricity tariffs increase groundwater extraction beyond the socially optimal level (Badiani et al., 2012; Fishman et al., 2016; Badiani and Jessoe, 2017).==== Smith et al. (2015) embed these tariffs in a macroeconomic model and show that these subsidies cause spillover losses in the manufacturing sector. Separate work has analyzed the external social costs of repeated well deepening by farmers in response to falling groundwater levels (Shah, 2012; Fishman et al., 2017). We add to this literature by analyzing these two features simultaneously in a dynamic framework. Critically, we find that these market failures compound each other: electricity subsidies substantially exacerbate the common pool externality by increasing (socially wasteful) investment in deeper wells and stronger pumps. This result is in contrast to earlier work that has found relatively small deadweight losses from the electricity subsidies in a static framework (Badiani and Jessoe, 2017).====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide additional background on the groundwater situation in India. In Section 3, we construct a stylized model of groundwater use and investment. In Section 4, we describe the specific functional forms and parameters used in our numerical simulations. In Section 5, we present the results of our numerical simulations for our baseline parameters and several sets of comparative statics. We also discuss the robustness of our results to certain changes in the structure of our model. In Section 6, we discuss the implications of our results as they relate to groundwater policies.

We examine a set of popular specifications in terms of consistency with some basic utility-theoretic considerations, including the adding-up condition that is currently under much scrutiny by benefit transfer practitioners. We also compare these models based on ==== fit with underlying data, and ability to generate meaningful and efficient benefit transfer distributions. We find that our preferred ==== Nonlinear Meta-Regression Model (BNL-MRM) satisfies all theoretical requirements. Using a built-in nonlinear model search algorithm we show that it produces benefit estimates that are comparable or superior in efficiency to those flowing from better fitting, but theoretically flawed linear models that do not satisfy adding-up.","The development of Meta-Regression Models (MRMs) geared towards Benefit Transfer (BT) of welfare estimates to a new or planned policy context has made significant strides in the last two decades. This includes the recognition of key econometric features for the MRM to generate unbiased and efficient benefit predictions (Rosenberger and Loomis, 2000; Johnston et al., 2006b; Moeltner et al., 2007; Johnston and Rosenberger, 2010), the determination of optimal scope for the data portion within the MRM to be used for a given BT context (Moeltner and Rosenberger, 2008, 2014; Johnston and Moeltner, 2014), and the inclusion of spatially explicit variables in the MRM to further enhance the relevance and precision of transferred benefits with respect to the policy setting at hand (Johnston et al., 2017).====Most recently, researchers and practitioners have started to scrutinize MRMs based on their theoretical properties as well, not just their econometric performance. Most notably, there is growing concern that existing MRMs fail to satisfy the ==== (AUC) (Newbold et al., 2018; Kling and Phaneuf, 2018). The AUC stipulates that total willingness-to-pay (WTP) for a large improvement should be equal, or at least close to, cumulative WTP for a series of step-wise improvements, leading to the same total quality change. As argued in Newbold et al. (2018), a violation of the adding-up property has serious practical ramifications for real-world resource regulation, where attainment with a final quality goal is often pursued with numerous smaller incremental improvements over time. They find that existing MRMs generally over-predict total WTP when quality changes are broken into multiple interim steps, and corresponding BT estimates are added up. At the extreme, some popular MRMs used in recent contributions can in certain cases predict WTP that increases unboundedly with the number of implementation steps.====Newbold et al. (2018) elaborate further that often times targeted pollution levels, such total maximum daily loads (TMDL) for water bodies cannot be reached with a single policy, but rather through a sequence of several different regulations, for example across industrial sectors or municipalities.====As a concrete example, the authors point at the ongoing cleanup of the Chesapeake Bay (CPB), with a watershed that spans six states and the District of Columbia. The TMDL levels for this water body were established in 2010 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2018b). As stated in the Agency's CPB watershed implementation plan, these TMDLs are designed to “ensure that all pollution control measures needed to fully restore the Bay and its tidal rivers are in place by 2025” (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2018c). This is envisioned to happen in three phases across multiple jurisdictions and sectors (e.g. agriculture, industry, municipal), with pre-established “milestones” for restoration and cleanup work, and midpoint assessments of progress, currently underway (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2018c,a). It is clear from the CPB example that ambitious cleanup objectives for large natural areas with multiple and spatially dispersed pollution sources can only be achieved over time, and in incremental steps.====Naturally, this raises the issue of cleanup-related societal benefits accumulated along the way.==== As reiterated in the peer review package for the MRMs used for EPA's final rule for permissible discharge for steam electric power plants, taking correct toll of partial benefits from partial cleanup is important for EPA's ability to highlight what has already been achieved, but also to justify continued cleanup by stressing remaining benefits that are “still on the table” (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2015b).====It is thus of obvious importance that the sequential benefits to society from gradual cleanup add up to the total benefits going from the initial (polluted) status to the final policy target, else one could increase benefits without bounds by breaking implementation into smaller and smaller steps. To stress this point, Newbold et al. (2018) give a stylized example that shows that net benefits (societal benefits minus costs to firms) can essentially be driven to infinity by cleaning up in steps, then re-polluting the same water body over and over again, if AUC is violated by the welfare-predictive model (footnote three, p. 532). Putting it bluntly, Newbold et al. (2018) conclude that “severe failure to comply with the adding-up condition would render a benefit transfer function unsuitable for applied policy evaluation work” (p. 549).====Thus, considering jointly the widespread use of BT by federal and state agencies in the United States and abroad within the context of environmental regulation or damage assessment (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2010; Loomis, 2015; Brouwer and Navrud, 2015; Rolfe et al., 2015a), the growing recognition of MRMs as perhaps the most promising tool to perform reliable BT (Johnston and Rosenberger, 2010; Griffiths et al., 2012; Kaul et al., 2013; Rolfe et al., 2015b; Johnston et al., forthcoming), and the importance of satisfying the AUC for a given MRM from both an academic and policy perspective, there is a pressing need to develop an MRM that delivers on AUC, while also displaying desirable econometric properties.====Newbold et al. (2018), recognizing this gap, structurally develop a nonlinear MRM that satisfies AUC, and estimate it in a classical context via nonlinear least squares (NLS). Using recently collected meta-data on WTP for water quality improvements, they compare their model to a popular linear MRM based on predictive fit and adherence to AU. They find that while the traditional model shows better fit with the underlying meta-data, it severely violates the AUC. Using realistic water quality changes as targeted by EPA's steam electric ruling, they show that the conventional model over-predicts benefits by 100–200% if the water policy is implemented in multiple steps.====The aim of this paper is to extend and generalize Newbold et al.‘s (2018) work in several directions. First, while Newbold et al. (2018) discuss the AU properties of three existing linear MRMs, we add three more specifications that have also been used to inform environmental policy in the recent past. Second, we broaden the theoretical examination of these MRMs by not only considering AU, but also sensitivity to the scope of the stipulated quality change, and the related concept of scope elasticity, recently brought to the forefront of the BT discussion by Kling and Phaneuf (2018). We also add a graphical analysis of the AUC problem. Third, we show that by ignoring (negligible) income effects, Newbold et al.‘s (2018) nonlinear model can be greatly simplified, which facilitates estimation. Fourth, by casting our analysis in a Bayesian framework, we add multiple econometric benefits over Newbold et al.‘s (2018) approach, such as non-dependence on asymptotic theory to interpret results, avoidance of the numerous estimation challenges posed by NLS, explicit modeling of observation-level heteroskedasticity and unobserved study effects, and rigorous, probabilistic model comparison. Fifth, we adapt a powerful Bayesian specification search algorithm, Stochastic Search Variable Selection (SSVS), to fit our nonlinear model structure. With the guidance of SSVS we then determine the optimal subset of meta-observations to use for a specific BT context. This avoids risky ex ante cross-context pooling assumptions while leaving the door open for non-context related data points to inform and tighten results.====In a nutshell, we introduce a Bayesian Nonlinear MRM (BNL-MRM) that satisfies all relevant theoretical properties while at the same time exhibiting a large degree of econometric flexibility. As we show, it also exhibits good predictive efficiency, especially when the meta-data is optimally pooled using SSVS. While our framework can be applied to any situation where environmental quality or quantity changes from a known baseline to a known or stipulated end point, such as air quality, noise levels, or acreage of open land or wetlands, we will cast our discussion within a context of water quality improvements, given the flurry of research in this area in recent years, and some readily available numerical examples.",Bayesian nonlinear meta regression for benefit transfer,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069618300561,January 2019,2019,Research Article,343.0

In response, China's central government has introduced new policy instruments to address these problems, including consumption taxes (Xiao and Ju, 2014), vehicle quota systems (or VQS) (Li, 2018; Xiao et al., 2017), and driving restrictions based on the last digit of a vehicle license plate (Viard and Fu, 2015). Despite the effectiveness of these policies in controlling new vehicle sales, their effects on reducing traffic congestion and air pollution are not obvious because these measures do not encourage a reduction in vehicle usage.====Greater attention has thus shifted to a policy that targets usage: a fuel tax. The government began to levy a fuel tax in January 2009, but the tax has thus far remained relatively low==== compared to those in other countries with similar economic conditions. Fig. 1 shows that most OECD countries have much higher fuel taxes than China. Therefore, policy advocates believe that China has a considerable capacity to increase its fuel tax. In other countries, it has been shown that higher fuel taxes affect not only vehicle purchase decisions but also consumer driving patterns (Bento et al., 2009; Parry and Small, 2005; Small and Van Dender, 2007). However, opponents doubt the effectiveness of the fuel tax in reducing vehicle sales and improving the share of fuel-efficient vehicles in total sales because consumers may be myopic or irrational about future fuel costs.==== Moreover, opponents may even challenge the supposed positive effect of the fuel tax in reducing externalities in China because little empirical evidence on the relationship between fuel taxes and driving patterns is available.====This paper applies a novel panel dataset of Chinese households' vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and provincial gasoline prices to investigate the effect of a fuel tax on driving patterns in China. Our empirical results suggest that, on average, consumers will decrease their VMT by 0.59% in response to a 1% increase in fuel prices, which is similar in magnitude to the gasoline price elasticity of VMT in previous studies on Chinese drivers using aggregate data (Lin and Zeng, 2013) but higher than the estimated values for the US market (e.g., Bento et al., 2009). We refer to this effect of the fuel tax on vehicle utilization as the VMT effect.====Previous literature has suggested that fuel tax has direct and indirect effects on both vehicle utilization and fleet composition (Bento et al., 2009; Small and Van Dender, 2007; West, 2004). The direct effects refer to the fact that consumers intend to buy fuel-efficient cars (composition effect) and drive less (utilization effect) as fuel costs increase. The indirect effects refer to the fact that the utilization and composition effects may offset each other: when more consumers choose the fuel-efficient cars, the average vehicle usage may rebound (this is referred to as the rebound effect in the literature); additionally, when consumers drive less in response to higher fuel prices, they may maintain their original choices of relatively less efficient vehicles, shifting the fleet composition back to a less efficient level. Most recent studies (e.g., Bento et al., 2009; Goldberg, 1998; Small and Van Dender, 2007; West, 2004) have examined both direct and indirect effects of a fuel tax, taking into account consumers' endogenous choices of vehicle fuel efficiency (composition effect) and utilization (utilization effect). In particular, their empirical evidence suggests that the utilization effect of a fuel tax depends on miscellaneous factors (Small and Van Dender, 2007) and varies across countries (Goldberg, 1998); and even for the same country, its magnitude varies over a wide range.==== In the Chinese context, previous research has studied the composition effect of the fuel tax (Xiao and Ju, 2014); however, rare evidence on the utilization effect exists as a result of data limitations: information on both driving and fuel tax changes is rarely observed or collected in China. To the best of our knowledge, Lin and Zeng (2013) is the only study on the gasoline price elasticity of VMT using aggregate regional data from China. Their estimated VMT elasticity ranges from −0.882 to −0.579. Our individual-level data on vehicle choices and VMT enable a more precise estimation of the relationship between gasoline prices and VMT. The VMT effect in this paper captures the direct effect of the fuel tax on vehicle utilization, which plays a significant role in our analysis of the effect of fuel taxation on externality reduction and welfare.====To quantify the equilibrium and welfare effects of the fuel tax, we employ the method of Berry et al. (1995) to estimate vehicle demand, assuming that consumers' vehicle choices depend on fuel prices and that consumers will implicitly optimize their driving patterns in response to the fuel price changes when choosing vehicles. We then conduct a counterfactual analysis, simulating the scenarios of various fuel tax increases and analyzing the equilibrium and welfare effect of the fuel tax. For equilibrium analysis, we examine mainly the effect of the fuel tax on reducing new car sales, which we refer to as vehicle control, and improving fleet fuel economy; for the welfare analysis, we consider the effect of the fuel tax on consumer surplus, producer surplus, environmental externality and government revenue. To show the crucial role of the VMT effect in welfare analysis, we compare the welfare effect of the fuel tax with and without accounting for the VMT effect. Furthermore, we also compare the proposed fuel tax to another policy in effect, the VQS, with respect to vehicle control and efficiency. Our empirical results suggest that the fuel tax is effective in vehicle control. A fuel tax leads to a welfare gain in all simulated scenarios with various assumptions on the lifetime of new vehicles, but the magnitude of welfare gains varies across scenarios. The VMT effect will not affect the overall welfare assessment when the fuel tax corrects only the externality, but it will affect the assessment of externality reduction: without considering the VMT effect, the effect of the fuel tax on externality reduction will be underestimated. Our main conclusions are not sensitive to various tax rates. These empirical results suggest a possible direction to extend the literature on the welfare analysis of vehicle-control policies in China (Li, 2018; Xiao et al., 2017), which has not considered the VMT effect. In contrast to the VQS in Shanghai, the fuel tax is less effective in vehicle control but more efficient in promoting social welfare.====This paper offers the following contributions to the literature. First, we exploit a unique panel of Chinese households' driving patterns over a three-year period to identify how their driving and new car purchase decisions respond to higher fuel taxes. Second, the large geographic coverage of households across Chinese provinces allows us to better identify the effects of fuel taxes than past Chinese studies that are limited to a single province (Li, 2018; Xiao et al., 2017). Third, after factoring in consumers' response in VMT to fuel cost changes, our welfare analysis suggests that previous research (==== Xiao and Ju, 2014) on the welfare effect of the fuel tax has exaggerated the disutility of the tax.==== Welfare gains should be higher with the VMT effect than without it. Finally, this paper provides empirical evidence of the welfare effect of the fuel tax in China and compares it to another policy, the VQS, which is essentially a sales tax. Previous research on the fuel tax has focused on the US or European markets (Bento et al., 2009; Innes, 1996; Parry and Small, 2005); few studies have been conducted with data on the Chinese vehicle industry (Xiao and Ju, 2014, is the only one, to the best of our knowledge). Our empirical study provides such evidence. Furthermore, our findings contribute to the debate on the effectiveness of the fuel tax relative to VQS. Both the fuel tax and VQS are important to alleviate the serious externalities of vehicle use, which has been a concern for the sustainable development of China and has therefore attracted unprecedented attention over the past decade. The central government has given priority to the fuel tax, while local governments have their own preferences (see Section 2 for details). Our paper provides quantitative evidence that governments can reference, thereby contributing to China's economic development.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the history of the fuel tax in China. Section 3 describes the empirical model and estimation method. Section 4 introduces the data. Section 5 discusses the details of estimation issues. Section 6 reports the parameter estimation results. Section 7 assesses the effect of the fuel tax on market equilibrium and welfare and compares it to the VQS via counterfactual analysis.

We use a panel dataset consisting of monthly observations from 2007 to March 2015 on wholesale and retail prices for 274 Minnesota gas stations that sell both E10 and E85. Consistent with prior research, the cumulative pass-through coefficient for E10 is 1.00 after one month. In contrast, the E85 market is sparse, and although pass-through increased over time, we estimate it to be only 0.53 statewide from 2012 to 2015. Pass-through is higher at stations with more local E85 competitors. In the Twin Cities, which has a high density of E85 stations, pass-through is nearly complete, but outside the Twin Cities slightly less than half the wholesale discount of E85, relative to E10, is passed on to the consumer.","The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 set ambitious goals for blending renewable fuels into the U.S. surface transportation fuel supply. The regulatory structure for achieving these goals is the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). The RFS effectively provides a revenue-neutral tax on fuels with low renewable content and a subsidy to fuels with high renewable content, which operates through the market for tradable RFS compliance certificates, RINs (Renewable Identification Numbers).====For the past decade, the main renewable fuel in the United States has been ethanol made from corn, and the dominant fuel blend sold at retail today is E10, which is 10% ethanol. Selling more ethanol into the fuel supply than provided through E10 requires sales of higher blends. Although there have been attempts to sell E15, the main higher blend available is E85, which is between 51% and 83% ethanol and can be used only by flex fuel vehicles. Because E85 has lower energy content than E10 and thus requires more frequent refueling, boosting sales of E85 requires providing a price incentive to flex fuel vehicle owners to buy E85. This price incentive is provided by the RIN subsidy, assuming it is passed through to the consumer in the form of lower prices in the E85 market.====This paper studies the pass-through of wholesale prices and RIN values to pump prices in the retail market for E85. This paper complements work on consumer demand for biofuels and in particular E85, notably Anderson (2012), who estimates demand elasticities for E85 in Minnesota, Salvo and Huse (2013), who study consumer choices between gasoline and ethanol in Brazil, and Pouliot and Babcock (2017), who use daily station-level data from a large retailer to estimate E85 demand. All three authors conclude that most consumers would only purchase E85 if it were substantially discounted relative to regular gasoline. These papers point to the importance of end-consumer prices to the success of the RFS. This paper provides evidence on the efficacy of the RFS system in providing those price incentives to consumers.====The retail market is the final of three steps in the gasoline supply chain. With considerable simplification, in the first (upstream) step, importers and refiners sell bulk refined petroleum fuels on exchanges and at the bulk wholesale level. That petroleum blendstock is then transported to a regional distribution terminal, typically via pipeline. Separately, ethanol is produced then transported to the terminal, typically by rail. In the second (midstream) step, these two fuels are blended at the terminal, sold to retailers, and pumped into tanker trucks for delivery to the gas station. At the third (downstream) step, the retailer sells the fuel to the end consumer at the gas station.====The wholesale price considered in this paper is the price for blended fuel charged to the tanker truck operator. This price is called the “rack price” because it is the price charged at the facility within the terminal, the truck rack, at which the blended fuel is pumped into the tanker. The gas station owner then charges the public the retail (pump) price. As explained in the next section, if the entire RIN subsidy to E85 is fully passed through from bulk wholesale (exchange) prices to rack prices for blended fuels, and if rack prices for blended fuels are fully passed through to retail prices, then the consumer receives the full RIN subsidy.====Our core data are monthly station-level observations on E10 and E85 prices at stations that offer both fuels, along with estimated wholesale E85 and E10 prices by station. The retail E85 prices were collected by the Minnesota Department of Commerce. The retail E10 prices are from Oil Price Information Service (OPIS), matched to the E85 stations at the month-station level. We also use OPIS rack prices for E10 and E85; by matching stations to racks, we estimate the wholesale prices for E10 and E85 paid by a given station in a given month. Because we know the locations of the E85 stations, we can also compute regional station density measures, for example the number of competing E85 stations within a 10-min drive. Our full dataset spans January 2007 to March 2015, which includes the period of high ethanol RIN prices beginning in January 2013.====We have three main findings. First, consistent with a large literature on E10 pricing, we find complete pass-through in the E10 market. As discussed below, we split the sample at the expiration of the Volumetric Ethanol Tax Credit (VEETC) on December 31, 2011. Using our sample of stations for which we observe both E85 and E10 prices, we estimate a cumulative pass-through coefficient for E10 of 1.03 using data from January 2007-December 2011, and of 0.98 using data from January 2012-March 2015.====Second, we find only partial pass-through to the E85 retail price of the E85 wholesale price, controlling for the E10 wholesale price, that is, of the E85-E10 wholesale spread to the E85-E10 retail spread. This pass-through increased over the sample period from 0.347 (SE = 0.023) in 2007-December 2011 to 0.525 (SE = 0.053) in January 2012-March 2015.====Third, there is considerable heterogeneity in E85 pass-through rates. Much of this variation is explained by observable factors. In particular, we find that pass-through is higher if there are more local stations that sell E85. Moreover, the entry of a nearby station into the E85 market reduces the markup==== on E85 charged by an E85 retailer. We also examine whether there is variation in pass-through or markups associated with whether the retailer is affiliated with an entity that is obligated under the RFS to retire RINs with the EPA. We find no meaningful association with obligation status, consistent with the profit-maximizing incentives for marketing E85 being the same at the station level whether or not the station is affiliated with an obligated party.====Taken together, these results are consistent with the E10 market being highly competitive, but the E85 market being comprised of local markets in which participants frequently have considerable market power. Having more local E85 stations increases competition and is associated with higher pass-through. In the Twin Cities (Minneapolis-St. Paul) metro area, an area of relatively high E85 station density, we find essentially complete pass-through of the E85-E10 rack price discount to retail prices. Outside the Twin Cities, slightly less than half the E85-E10 wholesale price discount is passed along to consumers.====Returning to the RIN subsidy, we estimate that in the Twin Cities, nearly all of the RIN subsidy for E85 is passed through the ==== supply chain and is received by the retail consumer. Outside the Twin Cities, however, we estimate that roughly three-fourths of the RIN value is passed through at the rack, and slightly less than half of that is passed through to retail prices. Statewide, we estimate that 0.35 (SE = 0.05) of the RIN subsidy passes through the full supply chain to retail E85 prices.====In a companion paper, Pouliot et al. (2017) use daily data on rack prices of blended fuel and upstream bulk wholesale prices at 283 terminals in 63 cities (including most of the terminals used in this paper) to estimate pass-through at the rack. Our finding here of incomplete pass-through at some racks is consistent with their finding of heterogeneity of pass-through of RIN subsidies to rack prices for higher ethanol blends.====The most closely related paper in the literature is the independent and contemporaneous work by Lade and Bushnell (2016), who use panel data on E85 retail prices at 450 gas stations in Iowa, Illinois, and Minnesota between 2013 and 2016 to estimate pass-through of the RIN subsidy to retail E85 prices. Their dataset and ours have several differences. Lade and Bushnell's (2016) data has the advantage of being weekly. Their data covers more states and heavily represents urban areas, whereas our dataset has mainly rural stations. The dataset here has the advantage of having wholesale rack prices by station: Lade and Bushnell instead use upstream bulk wholesale prices, which prevents them from distinguishing pass-through at the retail outlet from pass-through at the rack, whereas our data allow estimation of pass-through at the retail level directly. In addition, our data include retail and rack prices for E10, which allows us to control for broader price swings in fuel markets by focusing on the E85-E10 spread at the retail and rack level. The longer span here allows examining stages of market development, but our data end earlier than Lade and Bushnell's (2016) so has fewer observations in the period of high RIN prices. Despite these differences, the two sets of empirical results are consistent. Lade and Bushnell (2016) find nearly complete pass-through of RIN prices to retail, which is what we find when we restrict attention to the Twin Cities to be comparable to their heavily urban sample. Our results outside the Twin Cities highlight the heterogeneity of pass-through and its dependence on the amount of local competition.====This paper also contributes to literatures on RIN price pass-through at other stages of the fuel supply chain, on gasoline pricing, and on the RFS more generally. Burkholder (2015), Burkhardt (2016), and Knittel et al. (2017) examine the pass-through of RIN prices to the prices of obligated fuels in the bulk or exchange-traded wholesale market; their main finding is that there is essentially complete RIN pass-through at the bulk wholesale market. Relative to these papers, and to Pouliot et al. (2017), we study the pass-through of wholesale E85 (rack) prices and the wholesale E85-E10 spread to retail E85 prices.====This paper also contributes to a large literature on gasoline pricing more generally, see for example Borenstein et al. (1997), Borenstein and Shepard (2002), Bachmeier and Griffin (2003), Lewis (2011), and Owyang and Vermann (2014). These papers generally find complete pass-through of regular gasoline (now E10) over the course of 4–8 weeks, although price decreases are found to pass through more slowly than price increases. Stolper (2016) studies data on regular gasoline from Spain and finds complete pass-through on average, but also finds considerable heterogeneity in station-level pass-through coefficients, as we do for Minnesota E85 stations. Coglianese et al. (2016) find anticipatory behavior of E10 stations before tax increases, and in Section 5.3 we also find anticipatory behavior of E85 stations in advance of the entry of a nearby competitor. Anderson (2012), Corts (2010), Liu and Greene (2013), and Liao and Pouliot (2015) use the Minnesota Department of Commerce E85 dataset (which also includes station sales volumes) to estimate the willingness to pay for E85, but none of these examined pass-through. Relative to this large literature, our main contribution is to examine E85 pricing behavior; the only other paper to do so with station level data is Lade and Bushnell (2016).====This paper also contributes to the economic literature on the RFS. See Lade et al. (2015) for a discussion of RFS policy surprises and RIN prices, see Stock (2015) for an overview of the economics of the RFS, and see Irwin (2013a, 2013b, 2014, 2015) for insightful real-time commentaries on RFS economic issues. Finally, although the VEETC is not the focus of our paper, accounting for changes in the E85 market at its expiration plays an important role in our empirical analysis, and our findings in this regard are consistent with the more complete study of the expiration of the VEETC by Bielen et al. (2016).====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides more details on the RFS and the RIN mechanism and summarizes the empirical methods. Section 3 describes the panel dataset. Section 4 examines the time series properties of the panel data, aggregated to Minnesota state-wide averages, and discusses the break that occurred with the expiration of the VEETC. Empirical results using the panel dataset are presented in Section 5. Section 6 interprets the results and discusses broader implications, including for RIN pass-through down the entire supply chain.",Cost pass-through to higher ethanol blends at the pump: Evidence from Minnesota gas station data,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069617305508,January 2019,2019,Research Article,345.0

In a framework in which everyone suffers from pollution but health status also depends on individual human capital, we find that the economy may be stuck in a trap in which ","While average life expectancy has increased significantly in recent decades, health inequalities have persisted and even widened sharply in some countries. For example, Singh and Siahpush (2006) highlight that the absolute difference in life expectancy between the least-deprived groups and the most-deprived groups in the United States increased by over 60==== between 1980 and 2000. Such disparities in life expectancy represent a worldwide phenomenon. The OECD (2013) reports an average gap of 7.8 years in 2010 between men with the highest and lowest levels of education.==== In addition to its cost in terms of well-being, health inequality may have crucial economic consequences, through increased health and social costs, reduced productivity, discouraged investments in education and savings, ====. Accordingly, it has become a major political issue that many countries explicitly seek to eliminate (see the report of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2000 for the United States).====In this paper, we study whether environmental policy can be a useful tool for mitigating existing inequalities in life expectancy. We focus on the role of the environment in this issue for two reasons. First, there is considerable evidence that pollution has a positive and significant effect on mortality (see, e.g., Bell and Davis, 2001; Pope et al., 2002; Bell et al., 2004; Evans and Smith, 2005 or Beelen et al., 2014). At an aggregate level, studies estimate that 23–40% of all premature deaths can be attributed to environmental factors (see Pimentel et al., 1998; WHO, 2006), while air pollution alone was found to be responsible for approximately 7 million premature deaths in 2012 - representing 1 in 8 total global deaths (WHO, 2014).====Second, a key feature of the health effects of pollution is their unequal distribution across the population. In this regard, it is often stated that “environmental degradation is everyone's problem but it is especially a problem for the poor, who are less able to respond effectively”.==== This observation is broadly supported by empirical studies, as they provide evidence that disadvantaged populations - in particular, those disadvantaged in terms of education - have an increased susceptibility to pollution-related mortality (see, e.g., Cifuentes et al., 1999; Health Effects Institute, 2000; Pope et al., 2002; O'Neill et al., 2003; Laurent et al., 2007 or Cakmak et al., 2011). For example, Zeka et al. (2006) reveal that low-educated individuals in the United States have more than twice the mortality risk associated with particulate matter ==== of individuals with high education.==== Those differences stem from the fact that more-educated individuals are more likely not only to live and work in better socioeconomic conditions but also to enjoy better information that leads to healthier behavior and to have better access to healthcare. Through these channels, the human capital of an individual determines her/his exposure and susceptibility to pollution and hence how she/he is affected by it. Moreover, education alone is also identified as an important determinant of life expectancy (see, e.g., Elo and Preston, 1996; Lleras-Muney, 2005; Cutler and Lleras-Muney, 2010 or Miech et al., 2011), that is why it seems crucial to consider both pollution and human capital when dealing with health inequalities.====Thus far, from a theoretical perspective, there has been increasing interest in life expectancy and its interaction with human capital and/or pollution. The positive effect of human capital on longevity has been considered in papers such as Blackburn and Cipriani (2002), Castello-Climent and Domenech (2008) or Mariani et al. (2010), while the effect of pollution on mortality has been studied, for example, in Pautrel (2009), Jouvet et al. (2010), Mariani et al. (2010), Varvarigos (2010), Raffin and Seegmuller (2014) or Palivos and Varvarigos (2017).==== By means of this health channel, these contributions have identified the existence of a poverty trap with low life expectancy or fluctuations in the development process and the role that environmental policy could play in this context and its consequences (positive or negative) for economic growth. However, no study has yet been conducted on the economic consequences of the unequal effects of pollution on longevity, and very little consideration has been devoted to the uneven distribution of health in general. Regarding the latter, Castello-Climent and Domenech (2008) analyze the relationship between inequality and a longevity index determined by parents’ human capital. Focusing on a form of human capital that depends solely on a time investment, they find that an economy may converge to a long-term equilibrium in which two types of agents are highly unequal. Here, we extend this work by accounting for the role of pollution in health and a more complete relationship between longevity and inequality. We consider additional determinants of human capital accumulation that drive its convergence or divergence in a population, i.e., inter-generational transmission and the quality of the educational system (as in Tamura, 1991 or de la Croix and Doepke, 2003).====It is worth noting that two recent contributions analyze the interactions among health, inequality and pollution, i.e., Aloi and Tournemaine (2013) and Schaefer (2015). Aloi and Tournemaine (2013) formalize a model in which pollution has a direct effect on human capital accumulation (i.e., learning abilities) and find that a stricter environmental policy always reduces income inequality, as lower-skilled individuals are assumed to be more affected by pollution, and that this policy can also improve growth if the tax is not too high. Schaefer (2015) focuses on the effect of pollution on child mortality and finds that higher pollution implies widening inequality (due to different exposure) and hence that a higher proportion of the population will favor quantity over quality in their fertility decisions, thus hindering economic development. Here, we depart from these contributions in two major ways. First, we are interested in a different health mechanism, i.e., adult mortality, which is more relevant than childhood mortality, in our analysis of a developed economy because 99% of under-five deaths occur in developing countries (UNICEF, 2015). Second, we take into account endogenous and continuous disparities in the health effects of pollution (rather than having a threshold that defines two exposure levels). In this way, an agent's vulnerability to pollution depends at all times on her/his level of human capital, such that vulnerability can evolve with it, in accordance with empirical evidence that both human capital and pollution affect health. Such an Assumption enables us to consider the dynamic nature of inequality and a broader spectrum of long-term behaviors of the economy, in which convergence and divergence among agents are possible.====To conduct our analysis, we formalize an overlapping-generations model, in which agents can live up to three periods depending on their survival probability when old. Their longevity is endogenously determined by their human capital and by pollution. Pollution is represented as a flow that stems from aggregate production, while human capital is the source of both endogenous growth and heterogeneity among households.====We find that multiple balanced growth paths may exist. While there is always a long-term equilibrium without inequality, one or several long-term equilibria with inequality may also occur. A numerical illustration of the model reveals two possible scenarios.==== First, the long-term equilibrium without inequality is the only one but is a saddle point, meaning that it defines a huge inequality trap representing a situation in which inequality is widening at each generation. Second, this long-term state without inequality is stable and coexists with a long-term equilibrium with inequality, which defines another inequality trap but one of a smaller size. Consequently, there always exists a trap in which the economy experiences steadily growing inequality. We highlight that the pollution intensity of production plays a crucial role in determining the long-term state of the economy. When it is too high, the economy will be stuck in the inequality trap even if disparities are initially low. The underlying mechanism operates through the fact that longevity influences individuals’ preferences for the future and hence the return on their investment in education. As vulnerability to pollution differs among individuals, disparities in terms of longevity are wide when pollution intensity is high, which implies that their investments in education are also very unequal. Therefore, the gap in terms of health and human capital is rising at each generation.====Our analysis also reveals the cost that inequality entails for the economy in the long run, notably in terms of economic growth and health (average life expectancy). The role of pollution in the threat of being caught in the inequality trap hence raises questions regarding the possible redistributive power of an environmental policy and the latter's effect on growth. We show that an increase in a tax on pollution, the revenue of which is invested in pollution abatement activities, reduces the size of the inequality trap and can thus enable the economy to escape from it. Such a result comes from the fact that an improvement in environmental quality further increases the return on education investment of poor individuals, who have less human capital and are therefore more vulnerable to the negative health effects of pollution, than that of rich agents. However, the policy may be insufficient to escape the trap. When human capital inequality is too wide, the improvement in the environment required to close the health gap would involve a very high tax rate on pollution, thereby preventing individuals from consuming and hence damaging their welfare. Therefore, we conclude that an environmental policy can be a useful tool to address health inequalities but that the government should implement it as soon as possible, before the gap among agents becomes too wide. Finally, we show that a stricter environmental policy enhances the long-term growth rate of the economy, through the positive effect of the decrease in pollution on life expectancy and the resulting incentive to invest more in education, which fosters human capital accumulation.====This paper is organized as follows. We establish the theoretical model in Section 2. We provide analytical results followed by a numerical illustration in Sections 3 and 4. Section 3 focuses on the long-term equilibria of the economy, while the implications of the environmental policy for the dynamics and growth of the economy are examined in Section 4.

Different resource use regulations, trade bans and certified trade have been introduced, albeit with mixed success (Fischer, 2010). Against this background, it seems that the sustainable development goals of conservation of renewable natural resources (SDGs 14 and 15) and promotion of economic growth (SDG 8) are difficult to achieve simultaneously. Economic theory shows that optimal resource use is related to interest rates (Clark and Munro, 1975; Clark, 1990; Clark et al., 2010), and in particular resource depletion can be optimal if the interest rate is higher than the maximal reproduction rate of the resource (Clark, 1973). From a general equilibrium perspective, interest rates are highly correlated with growth rates of GDP (Acemoglu, 2008), which, in turn, are closely related to international trade (Acemoglu and Ventura, 2002).====In this study, we combine theories of renewable resource economics, international trade, and economic growth to study how economic growth and international trade of produced goods impact the depletion or conservation of renewable natural resources. We develop a general equilibrium model with endogenous growth to capture possible two-way interactions: growth may affect resource use, while resource scarcity may have repercussions on growth. The model consists of heterogeneous AK-economies in the form of Rebelo (1991) that specialize and trade in differentiated intermediate goods. Each country uses a renewable, exhaustible resource as an input in the production of a consumption good. The dynamics of the resource extraction sector are modeled according to the classical Gordon-Schaefer model (Gordon, 1954; Schaefer, 1957), where labor is the only input factor to the production function, as in Suphaphiphat et al. (2015). Renewable resources often have common-pool characteristics, possibly leading to overuse. The intrinsically dynamic nature of renewable resource use makes the management regime, i.e. the capacity to internalize dynamic stock externalities, all the more important. We therefore consider the institutional settings in the polar settings of full open access or full property rights.====We re-examine the result of optimal exhaustion of a renewable resource by Clark (1973) in a setting of endogenous growth and trade. Suphaphiphat et al. (2015) have studied this question for the first time in a general equilibrium setting with endogenous growth, but without international trade. The role of resource exploitation has also been analyzed by López et al. (2007) and Cabo et al. (2014b,a) settings with trade, but without considering the possibility of resource depletion. Our model of endogenous growth and international trade builds on Acemoglu and Ventura (2002), and extends it to include a renewable, exhaustible resources in each country (as in Suphaphiphat et al., 2015). Unlike Acemoglu and Ventura (2002) and Suphaphiphat et al. (2015)—who use log -utility, i.e. assuming an intertemporal elasticity of substitution of one—, we introduce an iso-elastic utility function that allows for weak or strong preferences for consumption smoothing over time. This flexibility matches the wide range of empirical estimates for the elasticity of intertemporal substitution, which range from 0.1 to 2 (Gruber, 2013). Allowing for an elasticity of intertemporal substitution different from one, we can study situations in which the income effect or the substitution effect dominates, which may have important effects. Bretschger and Karydas (2017) showed, for example, that the Pigouvian tax rule in a setting with exhaustible and polluting resources depends on the elasticity of intertemporal substitution. We also contribute to the literature on international trade and natural resources, which mainly uses static settings of North-South trade or small open economies with a focus on traded natural resources (see Bulte and Barbier, 2005 as well as Section 2). While this literature mainly studies how trade affects welfare, the focus of our paper is on dynamic allocative effects of trade and resource use.====In contrast to most other models of international trade and resource use—which mainly focus on one country potentially exporting a natural resource—we take a broader perspective and consider a world full of trading countries. Rather than studying international trade in natural resources, we focus on trade in intermediate goods, as the bulk of traded goods globally are intermediate goods, and trade in manufacturing goods holds a dominant position over trade in natural resources and agricultural products (UNCTAD, 2015a).==== Rather than studying the effect of trade on current resource prices, we thus focus on the intertemporal transmission channel of (broadening) trade on resource use in a dynamic setting. This channel is based on the idea that trade in intermediate goods impacts economic growth (Xu, 2000).====We derive three sets of results. First, we study how patterns of resource use are related to consumption growth. We find that the effect of resource exploitation on growth is neutral when the parameter setting is such that the resource stock is kept at a positive level in the long-run. When mining occurs, i.e. when the resource is depleted over time, resource scarcity slows down consumption growth. The impact from resource mining and increasing resource scarcity can be so strong as to turn consumption growth negative. The impact on capital accumulation depends on the intertemporal elasticity of substitution, i.e. whether the income or the substitution effect dominates.====The second set of results characterizes the bio-economic conditions leading to mining or conservation under the two institutional settings of open access or full property rights. Mining is more likely to occur under open access.==== It prevails when resource productivity is low. Under full property rights, resource mining or conservation depends, among others, on economic capital productivity and the household's preferences for intertemporal substitution of consumption. If the intertemporal elasticity of substitution is low, economic growth—driven by capital productivity—makes mining more likely, as then the income effect dominates over the intertemporal substitution effect.====Our third set of results relates to the role of international trade. By inducing convergence of all countries’ capital growth rates to a common rate, trade openness may influence resource use. Reciprocally, this common rate is endogenous to the resource use in each trading country. We find that under open access, resource harvest is the same as under autarky, and trade has no consequences for resource mining or conservation. Under full property rights, widening international trade impacts resource use via changing economic growth. The direction of this impact depends on preferences and whether the income or the substitution effect dominates. For existing trade blocks, we show that a change in the institutional setting of resource use in one country can impact economic growth and thus have repercussions on resource use in all countries.====The key message of our study is that international trade does not only impact traded natural resources, but also non-traded natural resources by changing the intertemporal consumption path. We thus newly identify a link between the sustainable development goals (SDGs) of conservation of renewable natural resources and promotion of economic growth. Widening international trade may give rise to synergies or a trade-off between these SDGs, as the direction of its effect depends on preferences for intertemporal consumption smoothing and thus on whether the intertemporal income or substitution effect dominates. In the previous literature this channel has been concealed by the assumption of logarithmic utility or the focus on a situation with a constant positive resource stock level in the long run. We relax the assumption of logarithmic utility in this paper and also allow for declining resource stocks. Furthermore, we find that changes in the institutional setting of resource use in one country has external effects on other countries via trade. A policy implication of our results is that new ways to regulate renewable resources have to be explored, as, first, the ‘standard’ policies like trade bans or certified trade cannot protect those natural resources that are not traded. Second, improved resource regulation in one country may induce trading partners to start over-using their own natural resource, a repercussion that needs to be taken into account when designing resource policy such as rebuilding fisheries (Costello et al., 2016).====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 gives an overview of the literature examining the interplay between growth, trade and natural resource use. Section 3 sets up the global version of our model, and derives the general dynamic market equilibrium conditions. Section 4 focuses on the situation of a country in autarky to clearly bring out the parameter configurations leading either to mining or conservation of the renewable resource stock under each extreme management setting. Section 5 considers the full multi-country model and investigates (i) how trade drives global growth, (ii) the condition leading to either exploitation regime under perfect property rights with trade, and (iii) under which conditions resource use in one country impacts trading partners. Section 6 discusses the results and concludes.","Economic growth, international trade, and the depletion or conservation of renewable natural resources",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069616303254,24 April 2018,2018,Research Article,347.0

By investing in a breakthrough technology, each country can bring forward the expected date of arrival of such technologies. The effectiveness of the technology, however, also depends on by how much carbon is priced. What happens if countries do not cooperate in international negotiations? The answer is that each one of them prices carbon too low and does not invest enough in the breakthrough technology, with the result that the planet has to endure excessive global warming as the expected arrival of the breakthrough takes longer. This corresponds to a double free-riding problem.====Our objective is to shed new light on these dilemmas in a world where technology spill-overs are prevalent and fossil fuel is abundant. We do this by modelling the breakthrough technology as an endogenous regime shift where the probability of the breakthrough increases in the globally accumulated investments in the technology. As investments in R&D make the breakthrough technology more imminent, and as the benefits of the breakthrough represent a public good, this results in an additional international free-rider problem. We distinguish three outcomes: (1) international cooperation among all countries concerned; (2) non-cooperative behaviour, in feedback (subgame-perfect) Nash equilibrium; and (3) second-best outcomes with international cooperation on R&D investments only.====We make three main contributions. First, we demonstrate how the outcome of partial international cooperation – on R&D efforts only – depends on the response of fossil fuel demand to technological breakthroughs. In the absence of international agreement on carbon pricing, internationally coordinated R&D efforts will exceed the socially optimal level if technological breakthroughs have their biggest impact on fossil demand when fossil prices are low. The reason is intuitive: a global R&D coalition will then expect the return to investment to be higher when carbon taxes are low. In this case, carbon pricing and policies to clean R&D are substitutes. We show this analytically for the special case where marginal damages from global warming (i.e., from a higher stock of carbon in the atmosphere) are constant and R&D stocks can be adjusted at a linear cost. Interestingly, for this case the symmetric open-loop Nash equilibrium outcome coincides with a feedback equilibrium outcome.====Second, we demonstrate the importance of strategic effects in our multi-country framework. To capture richer strategic interactions, we allow for more general functional forms, in particular rising marginal damages from global warming and sluggish adjustment of green R&D stocks. We employ newly developed numerical methods to solve the required Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations for the feedback Nash equilibrium of the calibrated, fully non-cooperative model, and compare the outcome with the cooperative (efficient) equilibrium. The incentives to free-ride on both abatement and R&D are compounded by dynamic strategic incentives to over-pollute and underinvest (to encourage others to undertake more effort). We characterise these effects analytically, and find numerically that the dynamic strategic incentives can be very strong indeed. We thus contribute to the highly policy-relevant topic of joint free-riding with respect to both R&D efforts and carbon emissions.====Our third contribution is technical, and related to the non-cooperative analysis of regime shifts under endogenous, state-dependent tipping probability. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to consider technological regime shifts dependent on R&D stocks in a non-cooperative setting, and the first to consider non-cooperative endogenous regime shifts with more than one state variable.====Section 2 first sets out how to deal with a breakthrough technology with an uncertain date of arrival in the context of a single country or of the global economy. Section 3 sets up the general non-cooperative problem and the feedback Nash equilibrium. Section 4 obtains analytical results for the case of constant marginal damages of global warming and no investment adjustment costs. Section 5 discusses the details of our illustrative calibration. Section 6 obtains numerical results for the general model under cooperation. Section 7 solves numerically the feedback Nash equilibrium and compares the outcomes with those under international policy cooperation.

We assume their support takes the form of a monetary transfer to the coalition, in order to induce larger coalitions, higher levels of public good provision and higher payoffs. We show that, under mild conditions on the costs and benefits of contributing to the public good (e.g. abatement of greenhouse gas emissions), there exist equilibria with support. Allowing for support increases payoffs to each of three types of agents: members, supporters and free-riders.","We augment the standard cartel formation game from non-cooperative coalition theory, often applied in the context of international environmental agreements (IEAs) (cf. Hoel, 1992; Carraro and Siniscalco, 1993; Barrett, 1994), with the possibility that singletons support coalition formation without becoming coalition members themselves. Rather, their support takes the form of a monetary transfer to the coalition. The transfer is paid in order to incentivize other agents to participate in a coalition that coordinates their members' actions to provide a public good, for example abatement of emissions. In the model, a larger coalition implies an increase in the amount of public goods provided, which is the prime incentive to provide transfers to the coalition. We refer to the agents who make a payment to the coalition as ====. We show that there exist equilibria (that is, stable coalition structures) with a strictly positive number of supporters. The existence of supporters increases the size of stable coalitions, the contributions to the public good, and the payoffs to each of three types of agents: members, supporters and free-riders.====A standard application of the model used in the current paper is the formation of IEAs for climate change mitigation (Finus, 2003). Up till now, countries' cooperation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions has taken off slowly, with the Kyoto Protocol as the prime example and the Paris Agreement as the latest agreement to enter into force. To the best of our knowledge, however, these agreements—as well as other IEAs—have not (yet) seen financial support by non-participating countries. One possible reason is that many IEAs appear to be void in the sense that ratifying countries would have reached the targets set in the agreement also non-cooperatively (Finus and Tjøtta, 2003; Böhringer and Vogt, 2004). If this feature of IEAs is common knowledge among the agents, there is no incentive for support. Yet, when cooperating countries would manage to agree on actions that go beyond non-cooperative behavior, our paper demonstrates that augmenting IEAs with the option of support would significantly improve the prospects for wider cooperation.====This result is substantiated by the following two other examples of public goods. The first example is given by peace-keeping missions. Typically a small core group of countries (the coalition) joins to lead the mission in terms of sending troops and equipment (Bove and Elia, 2011), with a set of other countries supporting this coalition financially (Khanna et al., 1998; Shimizu and Sandler, 2002). In the case of UN-missions, this support is partly formalized through a sharing rule for peace-keeping costs, although countries may opt out. In the case of non-UN missions, regional aspects and private incentives affect whether countries send troops or choose to provide financial support (Bobrow and Boyer, 1997; Gaibulloev et al., 2009). The second example is the occurrence of private charitable giving by donors to volunteer organizations. Typically, such charities use part of their gift income to expand their activities by recruiting additional volunteers, and possibly compensating them for any costs incurred. Contrary to donating money, volunteers donate their time to work for the charity. Volunteer organizations therefore rely on two types of charitable activities: a group of volunteers (i.e. the coalition) contribute their time to provide the charitable good, while a set of donors supports the charity financially.==== The common denominator in both examples is that agents can choose from different options to contribute to the public good. Our paper offers a general model of public goods provision with support from singletons.====The model that we use is a standard cartel formation game which features simultaneous membership decisions, a single coalition, and open membership. We augment this model with the option that (a set of) singletons support the coalition. We develop the model as a sequential game where agents first decide to become supporters or not. Subsequently, the remaining players decide to become members or not, given the support that is offered to the coalition. Finally, given the coalition structure, each agent determines his contribution to the public good. At this stage the coalition members coordinate their actions; essentially they act as a single player. We solve the game backwards and determine the Subgame Perfect Nash equilibria (SPNE) in support and membership strategies, as well as the associated level of supporting transfer and total abatement.====We show that, under mild conditions on the costs and benefits of contributing to the public good, there exist equilbria with support. For two common model specifications we show that equilibria with support significantly improve equilibrium IEA sizes and increase welfare. Although our model is a general public goods game, we frame it as an international climate policy game for concreteness. Thus, in the remainder of the paper, we refer to the agents as countries, to the coalition as the IEA, and to the public good as abatement.====Our paper is inspired by a classic paper on IEA formation by Carraro and Siniscalco (1993), who analyze four types of commitment to expand coalitions beyond what is feasible non-cooperatively. One of these (see their Proposition 5 on external commitment) is the possibility that a subset of singletons makes transfers to the coalition, thereby inducing the remaining singletons to join the coalition. This resembles the setting of the current paper, but there are three main differences. First, Carraro and Siniscalco (1993) rule out the existence of free-riders; countries are either member or supporter. In the current paper, we endogenize the number of members, allowing for the existence of free-riders in equilibrium. Second, we derive more plausible stability conditions that are based on a sequential game. This allows us to check, for instance, whether or not free-riders have an incentive to become members or to support the IEA, taking into account possible effects on other countries' behavior in subsequent stages of the model. The third difference relates to commitment. Finus (2003) correctly observes that: ====”; see also Carraro and Siniscalco (1993), p.315. Different from Carraro and Siniscalco (1993) our model does not require any commitment that is exogenously imposed on the players. In our model players become supporters or IEA members driven by payoff-maximization. Note however that we do assume a self-imposed commitment which is standard in non-cooperative IEA models: becoming a supporter or an IEA member implies a commitment to comply with, respectively, transfer obligations and abatement targets.====Carraro and Siniscalco (1993) find that commitment is required for equilibria with support, without further examining the sensitivity of this result with respect to the model setup. Subsequent research has taken this result for granted, so that further analysis on external support has been largely neglected in the literature (as opposed to the other types of commitment analyzed by Carraro and Siniscalco (1993)). One exception is Carraro et al. (2006) who analyze the role of various types of transfers in stabilizing IEAs using simulations. One of the transfers they consider is a direct transfer from a free-rider to another free-rider in order to ‘bribe’ him to join the coalition. This transfer is reminiscent of the supporting transfers in our model, but we analyze such transfers analytically and in a richer setting. The lack of attention for external support is somewhat surprising since the potential impact of support on cooperation appears to be substantial. Our paper therefore contributes to the policy discussion on the design, or architecture, of IEAs (Aldy and Stavins, 2009). Specifically, the option of support allows contributions to abatement by countries in differentiated ways, a central tenet in climate change negotiations. Differentiated participation is usually connected with broadening participation as well as broadening the scope for agreement negotiations (Olmstead and Stavins, 2012), a premise that we will see confirmed in this paper.====In the next section we introduce the model. In Section 3 we present our existence result for equilibria with support. In Section 4 we apply this result to two common model specifications and we illustrate the impacts of support on equilibrium IEA size and welfare. In Section 5 we discuss a modification of our game and its relation to Carraro and Siniscalco (1993).

To analyze this situation, we propose a sequential Nash bargaining solution: The government bargains with both lobbies simultaneously. Should this trilateral negotiation fail, it chooses one lobby for a bilateral negotiation. The disagreement point then is to bargain with the other lobby. Finally, should this second bilateral negotiation break down, the government chooses the welfare-maximizing policy.====As long as cumulative extraction is low, such that stock-dependent extraction costs are also low and extraction profits are high, the environmental organization has a weak bargaining position, but it takes influence to reduce extraction. Once that cumulative extraction has increased so much that extraction profits are below a threshold, the bargaining positions change, and the environmental organization gets compensated by the extraction firm for not letting the trilateral negotiation fail.","When governments of developing countries decide about whether and to what extent natural resources are to be conserved or depleted, their decisions directly affect the interests of other agents. Resource-extraction firms are motivated by the profit they can make by getting coltan or oil out of the ground, but they may care little about the rain forests or coral reefs in their way. Environmental NGOs, naturally, have the opposite motivation, and so do governments from some richer countries who try to promote conservation in poorer ones.==== These agents with opposing interests may face governments that can be influenced by monetary payments. Purely welfare-maximizing governments may see that their states would have a benefit of additional funds – and more direct payments may persuade governments that are less interested in maximizing welfare.====In this article, we analyze the political-economic equilibrium of this interaction between governments on the one hand and environmental organizations and extraction firms, both from foreign countries, on the other hand. What determines the relative influence on resource extraction? What determines the bargaining positions, and how does resource extraction influence their development? Will both lobbies pay the government in the political equilibrium? And is it always in the interest of conservationists to cooperate with governments and extraction firms, or should they seek an exclusive negotiation?====To answer these questions, we propose a model that takes the key properties of the situation into account. The government is the central agent, because it can not only choose resource-extraction policy, but also with whom to negotiate about it – inviting the extraction firm and the environmental organization to a trilateral negotiation, or one of them to a bilateral one. We model the interaction between cooperating parties as an asymmetric Nash bargaining that determines resource extraction and transfer payments. With utility assumed to be linear in money, the outcome of each negotiation would be an extraction that maximizes a weighted sum of welfare and the participating lobbies’ resource-extraction utility (this utility is negative in the case of the environmental organization). A lobby’s influence is higher if it has low costs of paying contributions to the government, and if the government values them highly.====The consequences of disagreement for the bargaining parties then determine the transfer payments – a lobby has to pay more if its disagreement utility is lower. In every round of bargaining, the disagreement points are determined endogenously by the government’s bargaining opportunities if the current cooperation should fail. If the trilateral negotiation breaks down, the government can choose one of the parties for a (first) bilateral negotiation. Should this negotiation fail, the government starts a (second) bilateral negotiation with the remaining party. If this negotiation also breaks down, the government chooses the welfare-maximizing policy. The government chooses the bargaining order in a sequentially optimal way, and all bargaining parties anticipate this order by backward induction. This sequential Nash bargaining solution, which allows to analyze a cooperation among three agents, is our first contribution.====It turns out that there is not always an agreement in the first bilateral negotiation. If the lobby that is involved in that negotiation does not care sufficiently much about keeping the other lobby from influencing policy, it will not be willing to replace the money that the government would otherwise get from that other lobby. Nonetheless, it may be the case that the government chooses to approach the lobby first with which the negotiation will fail. This credibly commits the government to welfare-maximization for the case of disagreement in the second negotiation.====Our second contribution is to show how the sequential Nash bargaining solution can be used in an intertemporal setting. Natural-resource extraction takes place over time, and it changes the agents’ future utilities both if they continue the cooperation and if they stop doing so, such that their bargaining positions change. We show that determining policy and payments as if the government’s choice between the bargaining parties were to take place in every time instant allows to derive time-consistent paths of both variables.====Our third and final contribution is to apply the model to a tractable setting of resource depletion. A firm would profit from resource extraction; its marginal extraction costs are stock-dependent, such that extraction is highly profitable as long as cumulative past extraction is low.==== Both the government and an environmental organization dislike extraction because it causes stock pollution and flow pollution. The firm’s payments persuade the government to accept positive extraction, however, while the environmental organization’s payments reduce the firm’s influence. We show that if the trilateral bargaining breaks down or is impossible in the first place, the common interest of the government and the environmental organization implies that the government would always invite the environmental organization to the bargaining table in the first bilateral negotiation, where both know that a breakdown would imply that the government and the extraction firm will agree on positive extraction. This way, it is possible to get paid by the environmentalists for something that the government intrinsically prefers, namely, leaving the resource in the ground.====It turns out that as long as cumulative extraction is low, such that extraction is highly profitable, the resource extractor’s willingness to pay is so high that the environmental organization would not keep the government from cooperating with the extraction firm. Once that cumulative extraction exceeds a threshold level, however, this changes and a disagreement in the trilateral negotiation would prohibit further extraction. This change in the consequences of a breakdown of the trilateral negotiation is reflected in the equilibrium payments. As long as such a breakdown would do away with the influence of the environmental organization, it pays in equilibrium so as to keep extraction low and keep up the trilateral cooperation. By contrast, once the threshold level of cumulative extraction has been crossed, such that trilateral disagreement implies zero further extraction, the environmental organization’s payments drop and possibly turn negative, such that the firm would have to compensate it for not leaving the bargaining table. Over time, equilibrium extraction and the firm’s payments go to zero as costs increase, while the environmental organization’s payments converge to a positive level. The long-run level of cumulative extraction implies zero equilibrium extraction, but the profit-maximizing extraction would still be positive, such that the environmental organization has to keep the government from cooperating bilaterally with the firm.====Our model is a first building block to understand cases of actual environmental-policy choice like, for instance, the dispute about the Yasun national park in Ecuador, a rain forest with extremely high biodiversity (Bass et al., 2010). In 2007, Ecuadors president Rafael Correa proposed to the international community, which would benefit from biodiversity conservation and avoiding carbon emissions, to compensate the country with US$==== ====3.6 billion for leaving the oil reserves in the Yasun area untouched. However, only about US$==== ====200 million could be raised, such that the initiative was declared a failure in 2013 and oil drilling has begun in 2016 (Vidal, 2016). Several environmental scientists and NGO representatives did not blame the international community, but both pressure and investment offers from China, the perception of “blackmail” (Neher and Pontes, 2013), and the parallel preparation for the oil-extraction option in secrecy (Hill, 2014). Our model disentangles the factors that increase or decrease the influence of the different sides in such conflicts of interest, and it helps to analyze how a multilateral cooperation differs from one that only involves one lobby side. Likewise, the analysis can be applied to the effects of different strategies of environmental organizations. For instance, the cooperation of the WWF with commodity firms has been criticized as “greenwashing” (Glüsing and Klawitter, 2012, Vidal, 2014). We analyze under which circumstances this behavior is beneficial for the environment.====Our paper proceeds as follows. In the next section, we explain in detail how our model adds to the literature. In Section 3, we introduce the sequential Nash bargaining solution for three agents, derive the equilibrium bargaining order, and show how the model can be applied to an intertemporal setting. Section 4 presents our application to bargaining over natural resources and illustrates how policy and payments develop over time.

Karydas Christos,"CER-ETH Center of Economic Research at ETH Zurich, Zuerichbergstrasse 18, 8032 Zurich, Switzerland,School of Energy and Environment, City University of Hong Kong, Tat Chee Avenue, Kowloon, Hong Kong","Received 30 September 2016, Available online 3 October 2017, Version of Record 17 October 2019.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeem.2017.09.005,Cited by (39),We study theoretically and numerically the effects of an environmental tax reform using ,"The purpose of this paper is to explore theoretically and computationally the existence of the growth dividend of an environmental tax reform (ETR) in a real growing economy.==== There are three social and economic dividends associated: The first one relates to the environmental quality improvement. The second is an enhancement in welfare by reducing distorting taxation, using polluting emission tax revenues. The third one relates to the “induced innovation hypothesis” as described in (Hicks, 1932), also known as “induced technical change”. According to this a change in factor prices will stimulate innovation to economize the use of the factors that have become relatively more expensive.====Existing empirical evidence supports the hypothesis of induced innovation in emissions reduction activities by increases in the consumer price of energy on firm – or sector – level: (Newell et al., 1999) show that following the oil price shocks in the 70's, air conditioners became more energy efficient; (Popp, 2002) provides systematic evidence of price-induced improvements in energy efficiency by using U.S. patent data; (Lanoie et al., 2011) study 4,200 companies in seven OECD countries and find strong evidence of environmental innovations due to stricter environmental policies; (Aghion et al., 2016) document that car manufacturers tend to innovate more in clean technologies when they face higher tax-inclusive fuel prices.====The theoretical literature initially failed to confirm the positive results associated with an ETR partly due to the static nature of the models used. Bovenberg and De Mooij (1994) using a static model of general equilibrium, examine the effect of environmental levies in the presence of preexisting distorting taxes where the government uses pollution tax revenues to lower distorting taxation. Using comparative statics they find that, due to preexisting distortions, “.environmental taxes typically exacerbate, rather than alleviate preexisting tax distortions…”. There are two effects in a static setting that indicate whether the welfare cost of an environmental tax reform is positive or negative in an economy with various goods and factors of production: the positive ====, and the negative ====. The former arises by employing the environmental tax revenues to cut distortionary taxes. This leads to an alleviation of inefficiencies in the existing tax system and can increase disposable income, labor supply, and welfare. The latter, however, arises because typically an environmental tax drives up firm production costs, which reduces the real household wage, and discourages labor supply; this reflects the fact that shifting the tax burden from a wide tax base, as in the case of income and capital tax, to a narrow one, like the energy input, is likely to further increase rather than reduce preexisting tax distortions, (Parry, 1998, Bovenberg and Goulder, 2002). Which effect dominates depends on three main conditions that allow for the exploitation of a potentially inefficient tax system: i) the burden of the environmental tax should fall on factors with relatively low marginal efficiency costs, ii) the revenue should be used to reduce taxes on factors with relatively high marginal efficiency costs and iii) the tax base of the environmental tax should be large and subject to low demand elasticities (Goulder, 1995).==== This strand of literature tended to reject the second dividend of such a tax reform.====In contrast to this, and in favor of using dynamic settings when examining such policies, Bovenberg and De Mooij (1997), show that higher welfare and growth is an option – even though unlikely – and determine the conditions for it. The response of technological change to environmental policy, and its associated effects on economic growth, then began to receive greater attention in the literature when environmental theory was included in models of endogenous growth. Hettich (1998) using a modified Uzawa-Lucas model with elastic labor supply finds that a higher pollution tax might boost long-run economic growth and that a tax reform which cuts distorting taxation can further increase this boost. However in the case of that contribution the polluting factor is the capital itself, an ever-increasing tax base, and no substitution possibilities away from this input arise, a rather unrealistic assumption. Using a multi-sector model of endogenous growth with R ==== D, Bretschger (1998) shows that in an economy with no preexisting distortions, an increase in the price of energy has a first order effect: it leads to sectoral reallocation and pushes more labor to the R ==== D sector, which boosts growth. Structural change also helps sustain research investments in Bretschger and Smulders (2012). Kronenberg (2010) finds a support for the second dividend, but no for the third one using a directed technical change framework with clean and dirty goods, based on the model of Smulders and de Nooij (2003). Popp (2004) argues that ignoring induced technical change can inflate the costs related to environmental regulation. Finally, Kruse-Andersen (2016) notes in favor of endogenous growth settings that “even small changes in growth rates [due to environmental policy changes] have large level effects in the long run”, and that “[…] static models and exogenous growth models (like the DICE model) leave out an important welfare effect of environmental policy”. Using an endogenous growth framework with research in both production and pollution abatement technologies he shows, however, that a stricter environmental policy increases the scope for research in abatement at the expense of research into production methods.====An important concern regarding policy-induced innovation activities is that low emission R ==== D might crowd-out resources from other R ==== D sectors, and act negatively on growth on an economy-wide level. In that respect, Gerlagh (2008), calibrates a simple model of endogenous growth with a climate module and three R ==== D sectors – a dirty energy-producing, a neutral manufacturing, and an energy-saving sector – and finds that, following an environmental policy, energy-saving R ==== D increases to a greater extend at the expense of dirty energy R ==== D. Similar crowding-out effects that lead to greater clean over dirty energy innovation can be found in an econometric study with patent data by Popp and Newell (2012), although the authors note that this is due to profit-maximizing changes in research effort, rather than financial constraints that limit the total amount of R ==== D possible. Dechezleprêtre and Popp (2015) state that even though evidence of crowding-out exists, studies suggest that it is rather dirty R ==== D that gets reduced to make room for higher clean R ==== D activity. Meanwhile, it seems plausible – at least for the time being – that dirty R ==== D is more efficient in promoting economic growth; see for example (Acemoglu et al., 2012). Therefore, existing evidence does not exclude the possibility of reduced economic growth, following a green tax reform that reallocates resources to the clean sector, even if the total R ==== D expenditure remains constant.====Our study comprises of both a theoretical and a numerical segment, the latter studying an environmental tax reform in a real growing economy. The analytical model extends the theoretical part of Bretschger and Ramer (2012) in several directions.==== First, we include both preexisting labor and energy taxation. This feature allows us to study a revenue neutral environmental tax reform where the additional energy tax revenue is redistributed by lowering labor income taxation. Second, we include leisure in the model. Since input reallocation towards innovative activities – and hence towards capital formation – will be crucial for our results, adding leisure to the model might decrease both employment in the manufacturing sector but also in the lab when policy is implemented. This acts negatively on growth and welfare. Third, we allow for a combination of scientific labor employment and direct investment in the lab.====We then bring our theory to the data. Using a fully dynamic multi-sectoral general equilibrium model of endogenous growth, which keeps the core components of our theory, we examine numerically the effects of a green tax reform in Switzerland. We choose Switzerland for our numerical demonstration as it has recently agreed upon implementing an environmental tax reform from 2021. The numerical model extends the structure of the model developed in Bretschger et al. (2011) in the following ways. First, while the aforementioned contribution abstracts from preexisting taxation, we consider a detailed representation of the Swiss fiscal system. Second, we include several heterogeneous households, instead of one representative household, which allows us to study heterogeneous welfare effects. Third, in the more complex computational model labor is freely mobile not only within manufacturing and R ==== D, but also between these sectors, thus opening up a new channel of input reallocation towards innovation.==== Fourth, we examine different redistribution schemes for the carbon tax implemented and show the results in terms of growth and welfare, in aggregate, but also for each household group.====Our contribution to the literature is twofold. In the theoretical part we identify the modeling conditions that can lead to higher economic growth due to an increase in energy taxation. We show that when the energy tax increases, mobile labor between manufacturing and research, and limited substitution possibilities in manufacturing between labor and energy inputs, can lead to enhanced growth: higher energy taxes reduce the demand for the energy good; with limited substitutability between inputs this reduces also the demand for labor in manufacturing and pushes it towards innovation. A positive ====. Contrary to the general consensus, this occurs even in the case of preexisting tax distortions. Exactly the same environmental policy is detrimental for growth in the typical case where new capital formation is the result of foregone consumption (“lab equipment model”): part of the final output is used as direct financial investments in the lab; as its demand declines due to an increase in the energy tax, so does investment activity into new forms of capital. A negative ====. The scope for investment and subsequent higher growth gets further reduced if labor is mobile within the manufacturing sector, or if a leisure option exists. In general the effect of an environmental tax reform on induced innovation and growth is ambiguous.====Turning to the numerical segment, we show that, in our reference economy with limited substitution possibilities away from polluting energy and a very low intertemporal discount rate, an ETR can induce innovation and higher growth in the long run if the additional tax proceedings are used to reduce preexisting capital taxation. A small decrease in long-run economic growth occurs, however, in most of the scenarios considered, i.e. for different CO2 emissions reduction targets and redistribution schemes. In the sensitivity analysis we show that a high elasticity of substitution between polluting and clean energy is beneficial for growth, while a higher intertemporal discount rate is not.====Carbon tax revenue redistribution through lower capital taxes is also the preferable option under efficiency considerations in terms of aggregate welfare. In general shifting the tax burden from a large and ever increasing tax base – like capital – to a small and shrinking one – polluting energy – is inefficient when the first dividend of the green tax reform is not monetized. A lump-sum redistribution is the least efficient option since in this case the positive revenue recycling effect is absent. The results on equity are not straightforward: low emissions reduction targets follow the consensus in the literature and speak in favor of lump-sum redistribution; the results turn, however, regressive when one considers a very stringent emissions reduction, exposing the inherently regressive character of carbon taxation. In our reference calibration, for a stringent target of 60% emissions reduction in 2050 compared to 2010, the carbon tax increases from 107$/tonCO2 in 2020 to 1'710 $/tonCO2. Overall welfare cost of the most stringent policy amounts to about 1.7% of GDP over time, while raised revenue to 1.5% of GDP in 2020 up to 7.8% of GDP in 2050.====In the next section we present the theoretical model which allows us to identify the sufficient conditions for higher growth after an ETR. The computational model is presented in Section ====. Section ==== analyzes different redistribution scenarios in Switzerland in terms of efficiency, equity and growth. It also exhibits a sensitivity analysis for two crucial parameters of the model: the elasticity of substitution between polluting and clean energy sources, and the intertemporal discount rate (also known as “rate of time preference”). Section ==== concludes by giving the appropriate policy recommendations.","Green tax reform, endogenous innovation and the growth dividend",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069616303308,3 October 2017,2017,Research Article,351.0
"Chen Xiaoguang,Yang Lu","Research Institute of Economics and Management, Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, China","Received 24 April 2016, Available online 12 August 2017, Version of Record 10 May 2019.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeem.2017.07.009,Cited by (68),"We pair a firm-level panel of annual industrial output with a fine-scale daily weather data set, to estimate the responses of industrial output to temperature changes in China. We have four primary findings. First, industrial output is nonlinear in temperature changes. With seasonal average temperatures as temperature variables, output responds positively to higher spring temperatures and negatively to elevated summer temperatures. With temperature bins as temperature variables, output increases linearly with temperature up to 21–24==== ====°C, and then declines sharply at higher temperatures. Second, lagged temperature changes exert large and significant impacts on current year’s output. Third, higher summer temperatures have larger detrimental effects on output in low-temperature regions than in high-temperature regions, which suggests that adaptation to warming may have been actively undertaken in high-temperature regions in China. Lastly, industrial output in China is projected to decrease by 3–36% by 2080 under the slowest warming scenario (B1) and by 12–46% under the most rapid warming scenario (A2) under the global climate models UKMO-HadCM3 and PCM.","With accumulating evidence that the world is becoming warmer, many studies have assessed the effects of high temperatures on economic output, estimated impacts that may occur under different warming scenarios, and discussed how economies should adapt to a warmer climate. Because of agriculture’s direct link with atmospheric conditions, that sector’s vulnerability to high temperatures has been the focus of many studies estimating the impacts of climate change (see Chen et al. (2016), Deschênes and Greenstone (2007), Mendelsohn et al. (1994), Schlenker and Roberts (2009)). Compared to the agricultural sector, the industrial sector accounts for a much larger share of gross domestic product (GDP) in many countries around the world. However, studies evaluating the impacts of temperature changes on industrial output, particularly studies using fine-scale, micro-level data, remain scant. That may be the case because micro-level data at the sub-country level or firm level are not readily available, particularly in developing countries.====An exception is Zhang et al. (2016). Using a panel data set of Chinese manufacturing firms from 1998 to 2007, they analyze the effects of temperature on output, total factor productivity (TFP), and input use. They find that output and TFP exhibit nonlinear responses to temperature, while temperature has very limited impacts on input use. Building on Zhang et al. (2016), we also examine whether industrial output in China has been affected by temperature changes, and, if so, to what extent. Using the same firm-level panel data from 1998 to 2007 as in Zhang et al. (2016), combined with a fine-scale daily weather data set during the same period, we exploit random variations in temperature within firms over time to identify the effects of temperature on industrial output in China. Although our paper is similar to Zhang et al. (2016), it differs in several key aspects. First, we identify the temperature effects on output more comprehensively, as we use two different approaches to construct temperature variables. In addition to using temperature bins as temperature variables, as in Zhang et al. (2016), we examine the temperature effects on output using seasonal average temperatures as temperature variables. This allows us to combine our parameter estimates of seasonal average temperature variables with existing global climate projections, which are typically only available at monthly or seasonal frequencies, to assess potential impacts of future warming. Second, we include sunshine duration as an explanatory variable. Because sunlight has been considered an important factor affecting human health and labor productivity (De Witte and Saal, 2010, Lambert et al., 2002, Patz et al., 2005) and is highly correlated with temperature, omitting this variable in the regression analysis could lead to biased parameter estimates of the temperature effects on output. Third, when using temperature bins as temperature variables, we identify the critical temperature threshold above and below which is detrimental to industrial output, whereas Zhang et al. (2016) focus only on the effects of high temperatures (above 32==== ====°C) on output. Identification of this critical temperature threshold is essential for the development of strategies to adapt to an uncertain future in global climate change (Hallegatte, 2009).====For the reasons discussed above, we have different findings than Zhang et al. (2016).==== Zhang et al. (2016) find very limited impacts of lagged temperatures on output and limited adaptation to high temperatures. In contrast, we show that lagged temperature changes have significant impacts on current year’s output. We also provide suggestive evidence that adaptation to warming may have been actively undertaken in high-temperature regions in China. In addition to the output effect, we also want to understand the mechanisms through which temperature affects output. While Zhang et al. (2016) find that output losses stem mainly from the negative response of TFP to high temperatures, we show that the reduction in firms’ investment and the increase in inventory levels in response to high temperatures are two other drivers behind output losses.====To obtain the net economic impact of temperature on output, while accounting for simultaneous variations in temperature and other weather variables, we include a comprehensive set of weather variables in the regression analysis. In addition to temperature, we incorporate rainfall, sunshine duration, air pressure, relative humidity and average wind speed. To minimize the estimation biases originating from omitted variables, we also control for time-invariant firm fixed effects and industry × year fixed effects. We intentionally exclude non-weather variables (such as input/output prices and adaptation variables) in the regression analysis, to obtain the total marginal effects of temperature on output. These marginal effects are the sum of the direct effect of temperature on output and the indirect effect of temperature on output (through temperature’s influence on input productivity, prices of inputs and output, and adaptation actions).====As noted above, we use two different approaches to construct temperature variables. We first use seasonal average temperatures as temperature variables to examine whether there exist differential effects of temperature on industrial output. We find that key results remain similar when temperature bins are used to represent the relationship between temperature and industrial output. Our central finding is that industrial output exhibits nonlinear responses to temperature changes. When seasonal average temperatures are used as temperature variables, output exhibits a ==== response to higher spring temperatures and a ==== response to higher summer temperatures. Our estimates of the negative effect on output stemming from increased summer temperatures (3.5–5.6%/1==== ====°C) are larger than the previous assessments for other countries (Dell et al., 2012, Deryugina and Hsiang, 2014, Hsiang, 2010). When temperature bins are used as temperature variables, output increases with temperature up to 21–24==== ====°C, and then declines sharply at higher temperatures. The critical temperature threshold identified here is consistent with prior studies based on high-frequency micro-level data (Zivin and Neidell, 2014). We also find that temperature changes in prior years exert large and significant impacts on current year’s output. These findings remain broadly consistent to variations in model specifications, econometric estimation strategies, and data.====Moreover, we find substantial heterogeneity in the effects of temperature on output across industries. Ferrous metal mining, timber, and rubber are the three industries most affected by higher summer temperatures, while stationary and office machinery are most affected by higher winter temperatures. We also find that higher temperatures lead to a much larger reduction in industrial output in low-temperature regions than in high-temperature regions. This finding suggests possible human adaptation to global warming in high-temperature regions. Even with this apparent adaptation, industrial output in China is projected to experience a significant reduction before the end of this century under warming scenarios provided by the most recent versions of global climate models.====Based on coarse macro-level data, several studies have found large correlations between temperature and industrial output (Burke et al., 2015, Dell et al., 2012, Hsiang, 2010). For instance, using a sample of 28 Caribbean and Central American countries over the 1970–2006 period, Hsiang (2010) analyzes the effects of temperature and cyclones on economic output (measured by value added per capita), while controlling for rainfall. He finds that, for a 1==== ====°C increase in surface temperature during the hottest season, national output falls 2.5%, with output losses in nonagricultural industries significantly exceeding the losses in agricultural industries (2.4%/1==== ====°C vs. 0.1%/1==== ====°C). Dell et al. (2012) examine how variations in temperature and rainfall affect the growth of industrial output, with a sample of 125 counties over the 1950–2003 period. They find that the growth of industrial output declines approximately 2.4% for a 1==== ====°C increase in annual average temperature, but only in poor countries. More recently, Burke et al. (2015) analyze a global sample of 166 countries from 1960 to 2010 and show that global economic productivity exhibits nonlinear responses to temperature in all countries. They find that productivity increases with annual average temperature up to 13==== ====°C and declines sharply at higher temperatures. Cachon et al. (2012) analyze a micro-level data set of weekly production from 64 automobile plants in the US over the 1994–2005 period, and find that a week with six or more days above 32==== ====°C can reduce that week’s production by roughly 8%.====With the exception of Cachon et al. (2012), the estimates of the temperature effects on output center around a 2–3% output loss for each 1==== ====°C increase in temperature. These estimates are slightly higher than those obtained by studies estimating the temperature effects on national income. For instance, Dell et al. (2012) show that, by reducing agricultural output, industrial output, and political stability, a 1==== ====°C increase in annual average temperature reduces income per capita in poor countries by 1.4%. Deryugina and Hsiang (2014) analyze a county-level panel of weather and income data in the US during the period 1969–2011, and find that income per capita drops about 1.7% for each 1==== ====°C increase in daily average temperature beyond 15==== ====°C.====This paper contributes to the related literature in at least three regards. First, we add to the sparse literature examining the temperature effects on industrial output by using a particularly comprehensive firm-level data set for a large country other than the US. Because the industrial sector contributes about 43% of China’s GDP and is the most important economic sector in China, understanding how temperature has affected China’s industrial output provides useful information for the development of long-term adaptation strategies to cope with future climate change. Second, in contrast to the previous studies (see Burke et al. (2015), Dell et al. (2012), Hsiang (2010), Zhang et al. (2016)), our empirical analysis includes sunshine duration as an explanatory variable to increase the precision of estimated temperature effects on output. Third, our study provides new suggestive evidence that adaptation to global warming may have been actively undertaken in high-temperature regions in China. This finding goes beyond previous empirical findings, because prior studies only find that countries/regions are better able to cope with environmental changes when they become wealthier (Dell et al., 2012, Hsiang, 2010, Kahn, 2005), not that certain regions may have actually undertaken adaptation in response to high temperatures for a long period of time.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section Conceptual framework presents a conceptual framework. Section Empirical strategy describes our empirical estimation strategy. Section Data provides data sources and reports descriptive statistics. Section Results presents the main results and considers a number of robustness checks. Section Heterogeneity in the temperature effects across industries examines heterogeneity in the effects of temperature on output across industries.

The analysis emphasizes, first, the effects of the different geographical relationships among decision makers; and second, the strategic behaviour of the agents. The dynamic game considers a pollution stock (the state variable) distributed among one large region divided in subregions which control their own emissions of pollutants. The emissions are also represented as distributed variables. The dynamics of the pollution stock is defined by a parabolic partial differential equation. We numerically characterize the feedback ","The standard dynamic models used in the literature to study different types of economic and environmental problems have restricted their attention to time. These models ignore space even when studying problems with an important geographic flavour. However, it seems natural to try to extend the analysis to a spatial dimension in order to describe in a more realistic manner the world’s economic and environmental problems. The technical difficulties that arise when optimization takes place in spatio-temporal domains are undoubtedly the reason for the lack of abundant literature on this subject. Recently some authors have introduced in different economic contexts (for example, allocation of economic activity; technological diffusion; environmental and climate problems) this spatial dimension. These authors have analyzed finite or infinite time optimal control problems extended to infinite dimensional state space. These contributions have focussed either on the problem of a social planner or on special private optimization problems. In the first case, the social planner allocates resources in order to maximize the present value of an objective over the entire spatial domain subject to the spatio-temporal evolution of the state variable. In the second case, particular assumptions either on the economic agents’ behaviour or on the diffusion process are made. These assumptions imply that the agents behave myopically in both the temporal and the spatial dimensions, in the sense that they do not care to take the future allocation paths into account. As a result agents solve static problems. To the best of our knowledge there are no previous studies that consider agents who behave both dynamically and strategically. This paper fills this gap in the literature and presents a first approach to characterize the equilibrium outcomes of an intertemporal transboundary pollution dynamic game where there is a continuum of spatial sites and the pollution stock diffuses over these sites.====The previous contributions in this area can be classified in two broad groups. First, the works focussing on economic growth theory with spatial diffusion; and second, the contributions which explore the spatial dimension in environmental and resource economics. In the first group the diffusion mechanisms involved are production factor mobility or technological diffusion, while in the second group are diffusion of a pollutant or the distribution of the biomass of a natural resource. The following is a no exhaustive list of works which can be classified in the first group: Brito (2004), Boucekkine et al., 2009, Boucekkine et al., 2013a, Boucekkine et al., 2013b, Camacho et al. (2008), Brock and Xepapadeas (2008), Brock et al. (2014a)) and Fabbri (2016). A list of papers belonging to the second group of the literature includes: Brock and Xepapadeas, 2008b, Brock and Xepapadeas, 2010, Brock et al. (2014b), Camacho and Pérez-Barahona (2015), Xepapadeas (2010). Finally, there are some recent studies (among others, Anita et al. (2013), Yamaguchi (2014), Desmet and Rossi-Hansberg (2015), and La Torre et al. (2015)) which could be classified in both groups. These works have put the focus on the analysis of problems coupling capital accumulation and pollution diffusion.====Brito (2004), Boucekkine et al., 2009, Boucekkine et al., 2013a, Camacho et al. (2008) and Fabbri (2016) analyze optimal dynamic social welfare for spatial economic growth models. In all cases a policy maker maximizes consumers’ well-being, capital is mobile across space and household’s budget is governed by a parabolic partial differential equation (PDE). Brock and Xepapadeas (2008a) also study the optimal spatial allocation of economic activity in a dynamic setting with capital accumulation. Unlike the aforementioned papers there is no capital mobility and the spatial component is introduced through technological diffusion. All these papers use extended versions of Pontryagin’s maximum principle to obtain necessary conditions for the optimization problems at hand and usually focus on the problem of a social planner who allocates resources. Exceptions are Brock and Xepapadeas (2008a) and Brock et al. (2014a) who also study the problem where an economic agent considers certain external effects as outside his control and treats them as exogenous. Therefore, there is an incomplete internalization of the spatial externality by the optimizing agents. Desmet and Rossi-Hansberg (2010) surveyed all this research devoted to the analysis of spatial economic growth models. Boucekkine et al. (2013b) present a survey of the use of parabolic PDEs in economic growth theory.====One of the first contributions to the stream of the literature that explores the spatial dimension in environmental and resource economics is Brock and Xepapadeas (2008b). The results on local stability analysis for infinite horizon optimal control problems adapted to their spatial context are illustrated with two applications. First, optimal ecosystem management model, where the ecosystems are spatially connected; and second, renewable resource harvesting models, where the resource itself diffuses across space. Brock and Xepapadeas (2010) apply their results on pattern formation to the management and regulation of a semi-arid system assuming two different settings. First, economic agents maximize myopic profits and ignore spillovers onto agents at other sites. Second, a social planner internalizes these spillovers. As the authors already noted due to the myopic assumptions regarding agents’ behaviour, the private optimum discussed in their paper represents a series of static optimization problems defined at each point in time and space. The same assumptions on myopic agents’ behaviour are considered in Xepapadeas (2010). This paper revises the tools for studying the interactions of pattern formation and agglomeration mechanisms in optimal control problems with applications to resource management. Brock et al. (2014b) revisit these methods and tools in their review of the applications of optimal control of diffusive transport processes to environmental and climate problems in economics. Camacho and Pérez-Barahona (2015) analyze optimal land use from a social planner’s point of view. The social planner decides the land use activities taking into account that local actions affect the whole space because pollution flows across locations resulting on both local and global damages.====Among the different examples presented in Brock et al. (2014b), the example closest to the problem which concerns us corresponds to the pollution control in a spatial setting. The PDE describing the evolution and diffusion of pollutants in the environment in Brock et al. (2014b) is similar to the specification of the PDE describing this evolution in our problem. However, we have a two-dimensional equation (theirs is one dimensional) which is an important feature when the geographical or spatial aspect of the problem is taken into account. Apart from this difference in spatio-temporal variability of the stock of pollutant, the main difference comes from different settings concerning the optimizing agents. Brock et al. (2014b) consider an environmental regulator who seeks to maximize the discounted benefits net of environmental damages due to the concentration of pollutants over the entire spatial domain subject to the spatio-temporal evolution of the stock of a pollutant. Our paper studies dynamic optimization for the pollution control in a spatial setting with strategic agents and focuses on the equilibrium emission strategies in a multiregional setting. An essential difference with respect to the previous literature is that we consider that each economic agent responsible for controlling the emissions at each region takes into account the spatial transport phenomena across space in order to maximize his profits.====Our contribution to the literature is twofold. First, we add the spatial aspect to the literature on transboundary pollution dynamic games (Van der Ploeg and De Zeeuw (1992) and Dockner and Long (1993) are seminal papers in this area, and Jørgensen et al. (2010) surveyed this literature). Second, we add the strategic aspect to the literature on spatial economics, and in particular, to the pollution control in a spatial setting described in the previous paragraph.====Building on these two branches of the literature, the objective of this paper is to investigate the impact of the strategic and spatially dynamic behaviour of the economic agents responsible for controlling the emissions of pollutant on the design of equilibrium environmental policies. More specifically, we aim at answering the following research questions:====In order to answer our research questions we state and analyze a problem for multiregional spatially distributed control of pollution. We state the model in continuous space and continuous time with two spatial dimensions and one time dimension. The planar region of interest is divided in ==== subregions. In each subregion there is a decision-maker who decides the emission level. His objective is to maximize the present value of benefits net of environmental damages due to the concentration of pollutants over the spatial subdomain corresponding to his subregion. His optimization problem is subject to the spatio-temporal evolution of the stock of a pollutant. This spatio-temporal evolution is described by a Diffusion PDE and general boundary conditions are assumed. Summarizing, our specification corresponds to a ====-player differential game with one control variable for each player (the emission decision at his subregion) and one infinite-dimensional state variable (the stock of a pollutant). Each player decides his net profits maximizing level of emission at each spatial point located in his subregion and at each time. In his maximization problem takes into account the PDE describing the spatio-temporal evolution of the stock of a pollutant. It is worth noting that the literature on spatial economics previously discussed seeking private equilibria, the economic agents act spatially myopically by ignoring spatial transport. In our formulation each player does not ignore the spatial aspect in his optimization problem. We characterize Markov-perfect Nash equilibria of the differential game.====As a first approach to characterize the equilibrium outcomes of the transboundary pollution dynamic game with spatial effects, and in order to overcome the difficulties arising from the infinite dimensionality of the model we consider a simplified model capturing the spatial interactions. This simplified model can be seen as a spatial discretization of the original model. This space-discretized model has ==== players and ==== state variables, each one describing the average pollution in one subregion. Each player has one control variable which is the average total emission in his subregion. Furthermore, when making profit maximizing emission decision at this subregion takes into account the time evolution of the ==== state variables. The time dynamics of the state variables is described by a system of ==== ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This space-discretized formulation fits the structure used by Mäler and zeeuw (1998) in their analysis of the acid rain differential game. Recently, Graß and Uecker (2017) apply a similar spatial discretization approach to transform a system of PDEs into a very large system of ODEs. They numerically treat spatially distributed optimal control problems with an infinite time horizon. As an example they analyze a shallow lake model with diffusion.====We analytically characterize the feedback Nash equilibrium of the two-player version of the space-discretized model. This model is solved using a numerical algorithm adapted from De Frutos and Martín-Herrán (2015) when more than two players are considered. Essentially, the numerical algorithm solves an approximate time-discrete dynamic game. Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the results. A first important conclusion which can be derived from our results is that in a spatial context the environmental policies might be very different from the traditional policies which ignore either the spatial transport phenomena or the strategic behaviour of the decision makers.====The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we present the multiregional spatially distributed control of pollution formulated initially as a continuous-space model, and in a second step, as a discrete-space model. Section 3 presents some numerical examples highlighting some properties of the Markov-perfect Nash equilibria of the model and their main differences with the formulation either without spatial effects or without strategic interactions among the players. Section 4 is devoted to present some concluding remarks. The characterization of the Markov-perfect Nash equilibrium of the model, the derivation of the discrete-space model as well as the description of the numerical method are relegated to the Appendix.",Spatial effects and strategic behavior in a multiregional transboundary pollution dynamic game,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069616302777,12 August 2017,2017,Research Article,353.0
