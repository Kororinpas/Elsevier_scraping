We consider an unstudied policy: the federal Controlled Substance Act (CSA) restrictions placed in August 2014 on tramadol, the second most popular opioid medication. This was followed seven weeks later by CSA restrictions for hydrocodone combination products, the leading opioids on the market. Using regression discontinuity design (RDD) models, based on the timing of the (up-)scheduling changes, to explore spillover effects, we find that tightening prescribing restrictions on one opioid reduces its use, but increases prescribing of close competitors, leading to no reduction in total opioid prescriptions.This suggests that supply restrictions are not effective in reducing opioid prescribing the presence of close substitutes that remain unrestricted.","Evidence of substitution between prescription and illicit sources of opioids is well established in the literature (Maclean et al., 2020). Studies such as (Alpert et al., 2018, Evans et al., 2019) find that policies limiting supply, such as the introduction of abuse-deterrent versions of opioids which are designed to make misuse less possible, may lead to consumer-side substitution toward products whose supply has not been restricted. In the case of Oxycontin reformulation, for instance, this substitution has been found to result in heroin overdose deaths.====Less studied are the substitution possibilities ==== prescription drugs. If substitution towards prescription drugs with comparable or higher misuse liability occurs, it would weaken the reach of policies that attempt to reduce harms from opioid use in general, but perhaps not as much as when substitution occurs only toward the illicit market. To address this need in the literature, we take advantage of a series of federal policies in 2014 that changed the competitive dynamics between two dominant products in the opioid market. We analyze these policies with detailed weekly data on prescriptions from a private claims database as well as from a federal tracking system of all controlled substances (Automated Reports and Consolidated Orders System; ARCOS). The supply restriction policies we study concern hydrocodone combination products (HCPs) and tramadol, the two most commonly prescribed opioid analgesics in the U.S, accounting respectively for roughly 46 and 15 percent of total US opioid sales since 2012 (IMS Health, 2012).==== Following increasing trends in all opioids, between 2008 and 2013 HCP prescriptions increased from 124.1 million to 136.7 million and tramadol product prescriptions climbed from 23.3 million to 44 million (DEA, 2018).====Perhaps unsurprisingly, emergency department visits involving misuse of HCPs and tramadol also increased in parallel by 75 and 250 percent, resulting in 82,480 and 21,649 visits, respectively, in 2011 (Bush, 2015, Crane, 2013). According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), in 2015 12.5 million and 1.6 million people in the U.S. population aged 12 and older misused HCPs and tramadol products, respectively (DEA, 2018).====Following increased evidence of tramadol and HCPs misuse, the DEA for the first time placed tramadol and its combination products on Schedule IV (CIV) as a controlled substance on August 18, 2014, and up-scheduled HCPs to a Schedule II (CII) controlled substance effective October 6, 2014 (DEA, 2014a, DEA, 2014b). These policies that tightened controls on prescribing of tramadol products and HCPs occurred within-year (within-months) and could not be separately analyzed without high-frequency data at the weekly level.====Controlled substance policies also present an opportunity to study comparative effects when the same federal policy tool is enacted earlier at the state level. State controlled substance acts are communicated and enforced much like federal policies, but by state offices of drug control policy and the inspector general’s offices (Lampe, 2023). Delayed federal action led twelve U.S. States to schedule tramadol combination products as CIV controlled substances within their states between 2007–2014, prior to federal scheduling. New York was the only state to up-schedule HCPs to CII of the CSA in 2013. Refill and prescription length validity rules apply in the same way at federal and state policy levels, except that state laws of course only apply to prescriptions filled within state boundaries. Specifically, refills for HCPs were prohibited, initial prescriptions could not be filled after 60 days from their writing, and prescriptions could cover at maximum 90 days worth of medication. Thus any subsequent prescription would require a new doctor visit.====As a CIV controlled substance, tramadol prescriptions became valid for up to 6 months after being written; up to 5 refills were allowed within 6 months of original prescription, with subsequent fills requiring a new prescription. Also, as a controlled substance, in some states tramadol could no longer be prescribed by non-physician practitioners due to scope-of-practice laws.====No previous study we are aware of has examined the impact of tramadol scheduling, either at the state or federal level. In the case of supply-side state laws such as the heavily studied PDMPs, days limits, pain clinic laws, and marijuana availability laws, there is no federal version for comparison. The tramadol scheduling law is thus a unique case, as it was first enacted at the state level and then at the federal level in identical form.====Previous descriptive research suggests that federal up-scheduling of HCPs is associated with decreases in its prescribing (Jones et al., 2016, Bernhardt et al., 2016, Fleming et al., 2017, Gudin and Lee, 2013, Murimi et al., 2019, Northrup et al., 2019); a similar finding occurs in the first economic study of HCPs’ up-scheduling (Beheshti, 2019), which finds improved labor market conditions in areas with baseline high intensity of HCP reliance. However, the quarterly version of the ARCOS data used in that study does not allow examining the spillover hypothesis to the closest competitor, tramadol, both because tramadol, like all other schedule IV substances, is not contained in the ARCOS and because weekly data would be needed to separate effects of the two CSA events. Thus, we are able to extend the literature on CSA policy by first assessing changes in prescribing at the intensive or extensive margins that may result from initial scheduling of a previously non-scheduled medication – tramadol –, comparing the relative responses between state- versus federal-level (up-)scheduling of medications, and finally examining the spillover effects when two close competitor products in the opioid market experience restrictions to their supply.====While a larger literature in economics considers the spillovers from negative information on competitor products in pharmaceutical markets (e.g. Cawley and Rizzo, 2008, Collins et al., 2013, Bala et al., 2017, Bütikofer et al., 2020, Daysal and Orsini, 2015, Romley and Shih, 2017), and in non-medical markets (e.g. Freedman et al., 2012, Toledo and Villas-Boas, 2019), the closest past literature in medical spillovers to our study is likely in the COX-2 selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) market, where Vioxx, the most popular product at the time, was voluntarily withdrawn at the FDA’s request, following evidence of heart attack health harms. Collins et al. (2013) found that consumers switched to other close competitor medications in the same (such as Celebrex and Bextra) and closely related drug classes (analgesics). Six months later, Bextra was withdrawn at the FDA’s request following further studies, at which point demand dropped for all NSAIDs. Thus, past literature and theory suggest that consumers/prescribers do not always react to a change in supply restriction on one product by switching to the closest competitor products, if they perceive the negative information as indicating health risks about the product class in general.====There is also a very large literature on the effects of restrictions on all prescription opioids, which by definition do not leave room for any substitution within the category. These include PDMPs and pill mill laws, as well as a variety of other lesser studied state policies. While earlier PDMP studies found mixed results (eg Meara et al. (2016) find no change in various measures of opioid use after adoption of a PDMP. Kilby 2016 finds a 12% decline in opioid-related mortality following a PDMP), and more recent research has distinguished between mandatory and non-mandatory PDMPs to find that mandatory policies are effective at reducing prescription opioid misuse (Deiana and Giua, 2018, Bao et al., 2018, Mallatt, 2018, Buchmueller and Carey, 2018a, Grecu et al., 2019, Ali et al., 2017, Ziedan and Kaestner, 2020, Kaestner and Ziedan, 2019, Wen et al., 2019). There is also evidence that even if a patient has no prior opioid use, PDMPs may cause prescribers to reduce new prescriptions due to hassle cost of using the PDMP or because PDMP laws have made prescribed more attentive to opioid prescribing (Alpert et al., 2020, Sacks et al., 2021).====Pill mill laws impose stricter restrictions than PDMPs on pain management clinics that prescribe and/or dispense opioids, and these state laws appear to have reduced supply (Deiana and Giua, 2018, Popovici et al., 2018, Ziedan and Kaestner, 2020). There is a large literature that also studies downstream impacts of these policies. Despite this large literature, there is as yet only a small literature on the efficacy of federal- or state- level CSA restrictions in impacting opioid prescribing.====Using quasi-experimental regression discontinuity designs (RDD), based on the timing of the (up-)scheduling changes, this study proceeds as follows: we first examine how the up-scheduling of HCPs to a CII controlled substance and the initial scheduling of tramadol as a CIV controlled substance have changed their own prescribing. Second, we examine the spillover effects of controlled substance status of each of these drugs on the prescribing of similarly controlled and less controlled substitutes, and their consequences for the overall prescription dispensing of opioids. We do this primarily with rich data from private health insurance claims data, but conduct confirmatory analysis with federal data that covers other payer types. Third, we compare the effectiveness of federal- and state- level controlled substance designations in reducing prescribing of controlled drugs. Fourth, we test for heterogeneous responses to fixed vs variable costs of switching by sorting prescribers into quartiles based on their HCP and tramadol prescribing volume prior to the scheduling changes: we examine whether high-volume prescribers responded differentially to the scheduling changes than their low-volume prescribing counterparts. Finally, we investigate whether prescribers responded differently along medical specialty lines to the scheduling changes, as some specialities (e.g., pain specialists) might have not changed their informational view on the medications from re-scheduling or may have patients for whom the clinical appropriateness of the medications would supersede the prescribing transactions costs.====Stricter CSA regulations may operate through multiple economic pathways to influence prescriber behavior. First, the restrictions on refills would require more frequent office interaction with physicians for new prescriptions, causing burdens for patients and prescribers alike. Second, in addition to increasing healthcare utilization (additional office visits), prescribing more strictly controlled substances would impose recurrent operating costs to provide written or electronic prescriptions, log into and query the state prescription drug monitoring program before prescribing, enter new data and react to existing data. Third, at least in some states, as a controlled substance tramadol could no longer be prescribed by non-physician practitioners due to scope-of-practice laws, leading to immediate reductions in prescription dispensing.==== Fourth, (up-)scheduling may increase prescriber perception of the risks associated with HCP and tramadol use, thereby negatively impacting the prescriber’s perception of the net gain from the medication for the patient, and increasing a sense of more dire consequences if now found negligent through prescriber monitoring. Previous research on FDA drug withdrawals, FDA black-box warnings and Consumer Production Safety Commission non-prescription product (children’s toys) recalls shows that competitors in the same therapeutic class could experience negative spillovers in some settings (Parkinson et al., 2014, Collins et al., 2013, Freedman et al., 2012, Cawley and Rizzo, 2008). In case of (up-) scheduling of HCPs and tramadol, some of these new prescribing restrictions would be immediately enforced directly at the pharmacy level (e.g., direct pharmacy inability to refill or fill a controlled substance prescription from a non-physician provider in case of prescribing authority limits). Prescribing changes due to increased prescriber perception of risks associated with using HCP and tramadol may also be immediate and persistent. Additionally, there may be other longer-term dynamic prescribing effects of the scheduling changes, as already filled prescriptions and existing permissible fills (====5 fills still allowed for tramadol) continue to run out or because of technological innovation, substitution patterns, or general equilibrium changes in enforcement or demand.====In comparison to state-level scheduling changes, which may feel somewhat arbitrary, federal CSA regulations may unequivocally signal the salience of new information, resulting in greater reductions in prescribing through this channel. Unlike in usual cases of state vs. federal laws (e.g. young adult health insurance mandates, or mental health parity laws), CSA policy changes are enforced the same way by pharmacies, as the most stringent law binds in cases where state and federal laws differ.====Our main data source is Optum’s de-identified Clinformatics® Data Mart system, a comprehensive commercial and Medicare Advantage claims database. Our empirical analysis utilizes prescription claims data covering all states from January 2007 to December 2017, and uses regression discontinuity designs to study both national and state policy changes. In sensitivity analysis for the state analysis, difference-in-difference event study methods are used to confirm the robustness of our estimates. We find evidence that federal (up-)scheduling of HCPs and tramadol and state-level scheduling of tramadol were associated with significant declines in the prescribing of both opioids, as expected. This finding has important implications for state policy. In case of delayed federal action, states can effectively control prescription dispensing of substances with abuse potential through CSA scheduling changes at the state level.====The majority of the decline in prescription dispensing of HCP and tramadol was in refills, possibly reflecting the expected reaction to the new prohibition on HCP refills and limits on tramadol refills. Although the decline in tramadol prescribing was also more concentrated in refills, the decline in initial tramadol prescriptions also substantively contributed to the overall decline in tramadol prescribing. This is also as expected, since the tramadol policy change was less stringent regarding refills (CIV: max 5 fills in max 6 month prescription; CII: outright ban on refills).====An important strength of our data is that they allow us to examine substitution between opioids, as both HCP and tramadol prescriptions are recorded, unlike in ARCOS. We find that up-scheduling of HCPs is associated with substantial increases in the prescribing of less regulated opioids (like tramadol), and, to a smaller extent, similarly regulated opioids (like oxycodone). Refills are allowed on schedule III opioid substitutes, which lowers the variable cost per prescription for these less regulated alternatives. And the other schedule II opioids that HCPs joined were just as costly to prescribe as HCPs. However, in the absence of less regulated opioid substitutes to tramadol, we find only weak evidence of substitution away from tramadol following its scheduling. Overall, the decline in the prescription dispensing of HCPs and tramadol following their (up)scheduling was entirely offset by the increase in prescribing of other opioid alternatives, resulting in no net decline in the combined volume of all opioids dispensed. Although tramadol is not available in ARCOS data, we use the newly available weekly level ARCOS version to establish that the changes we see in Optum for other drugs are reflected in this all-payer census of almost all other prescription opioids; this suggests that the patterns we see in our main analysis are not unique to privately insured prescriptions. Our results suggest that at both the federal and state levels, CSA scheduling of drugs is effective in curbing excessive prescribing of drugs with known dependence and misuse potential, but as found in other contexts, there are substitution behaviors that may undermine the deeper intention of the policy.",Competitive effects of federal and state opioid restrictions: Evidence from the controlled substance laws,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629623000498,Available online 14 June 2023,2023,Research Article,0.0

We show that this condition is not satisfied for voluntary deductibles in the Netherlands, which are optional deductibles on top of the mandatory deductible introduced by the Dutch government. We find that low-risk types, that mainly choose voluntary deductibles, have a lower elasticity of demand than high-risk types. Moreover, we show that voluntary deductibles introduce equity problems as it results in non-trivial cross subsidies from high-risk to low-risk types. Capping the level of voluntary deductibles (imposing minimum generosity) is likely to be welfare enhancing in the Netherlands.","Since Arrow (1963) it is well-known that full coverage is optimal in competitive health insurance markets in the case of no moral hazard. Pauly (1968) and Zeckhauser (1970) show that with moral hazard, coverage levels should be set lower to prevent excessive health care consumption by consumers. They argue that the level of coverage should be inversely related to the elasticity of demand, i.e. the higher the elasticity of demand the lower coverage levels should be set. This implies that if a government wants to differentiate coverage levels across consumers, consumers with a high elasticity of demand should face lower levels of coverage. However, differentiation in coverage levels can also introduce consumer choice, and thus selection problems. For example, insurers may try to cherry pick low-risk-types by offering coverage contracts that are not attractive for high-risk types (Rothschild and Stiglitz, 1976). Such risk selection may reduce welfare as well as lead to a cross subsidy from high-risk types –which tend to have low incomes– to low-risk types that are healthier and tend to have higher earnings. This may be seen as undesirable from a distribution or solidarity point of view. In many countries policymakers have to make this trade-off between combatting moral hazard by offering more choice in coverage versus selection and distribution problems.====We analyze different insurance coverage levels in the context of Dutch health insurance, where private insurers compete in a regulated market. One of the interesting features of this regulation is that it specifies a minimum and maximum generosity level for health insurance. In particular, there is a mandatory deductible that applies to everyone above age 18 and people can opt for an additional voluntary deductible which is at maximum 500 euros.==== In the Netherlands, this is a fixed deductible level in euros (i.e. the co-insurance rate equals 1). This paper focuses on the specification of the maximum voluntary deductible (or minimum generosity) for health insurance.====We introduce a theoretical framework to show that specifying a minimum generosity in a health insurance market is in general welfare enhancing. The only exception is a competitive insurance market where there are no (adverse) selection issues, for example due to a perfect risk adjustment system. In such a case the market will offer optimal generosity levels. However, we are not aware of any country with a competitive health insurance market that does not suffer from selection problems. The intuition why a minimum generosity level increases welfare is that the market inefficiently reduces generosity in order to cherry pick low-risk types. From this theoretical framework we derive conditions under which offering a voluntary deductible (on top of a mandatory deductible) increases welfare. To illustrate how countries can check these conditions, we use Dutch data on individual healthcare expenditures. We show that for the Netherlands it is actually better to abolish the voluntary deductible; that is, equate the minimum and maximum generosity level in health insurance.====To assess whether allowing for a voluntary deductible is welfare enhancing in the Netherlands, we need to separate moral hazard from selection effects. This is empirically challenging (Bajari et al., 2014, Trottmann et al., 2012, Geruso and Layton, 2017). Randomized controlled experiments, such as the RAND and Oregon experiments (Newhouse and the Insurance Experiment Group, 1993, Finkelstein et al., 2012, Chiappori et al., 1998), are less suited as the idea of randomization is to remove endogenous choice, and thus selection problems. That is, in such an experimental set-up there is no selection effect to start with. The majority of papers analyzing non-experimental data remove selection by using econometric techniques such as instrumental variables (examples are Eichner, 1998, Trottmann et al., 2012, Van Vliet, 2004, Alessie et al., 2020) or by using a structural model (Bajari et al., 2014, Gardiol et al., 2008). These approaches often require restrictive assumptions. Bajari et al. (2014) and Einav et al. (2013) measure and visualize selection by showing the distribution of health status and expected health risks parameters across multiple health insurance plans.====Our identification strategy relies on the start of cost-sharing in the Netherlands at age 18 and the yearly increase of the mandatory deductible size by the government during 2008–2013. This identification, in the spirit of a regression discontinuity design, allows us to separate selection from moral hazard effects in a clean way. In many adverse selection papers, such as Bajari et al. (2014), Einav et al. (2013) and Cutler and Reber (1998), endogenous contracts complicate the analysis as contracts differ in a number of dimensions.==== In the Netherlands, endogenous contract dimensions are limited, because the coverage of the mandatory (basic) healthcare plans across the Dutch population only differs by the level of the deductible. The treatments covered by basic insurance are set by the government, not by the insurers. Insurance contracts can differ in their provider networks, but these differences are small in the period that we analyze.====We find that average healthcare expenditures for persons who never choose a voluntary deductible after age 18 (in our data) are almost twice as high just before age 18 than average healthcare expenditures of persons who have chosen a voluntary deductible after 18 in our data. This difference is mainly the result of selection, not a reduction of moral hazard. Indeed, expenditure decisions before 18 are not affected by cost sharing after 18.====Moreover, we find that 18 year olds who have never chosen a voluntary deductible reduce their healthcare spending by 26 euros (on average) in response to a 100 euro increase in the (mandatory) deductible. However, for 18 year olds who have chosen a voluntary deductible we find on average no response to an increase in the (mandatory plus voluntary) deductible. Other potential causes for these findings –for example the difference in price responsiveness between the group who chooses and not chooses for a voluntary deductible could be explained by whether individuals are at the margin– are not confirmed in our data. The lower moral hazard effect for the group with a voluntary deductible (compared to the group with only a mandatory deductible) is one of the main reasons why abolishing the voluntary deductible for the Netherlands will increase welfare.====Next we perform a policy analysis at the population level to determine the moral hazard and selection effects and the size of cross subsidies from high-risk to low-risk individuals due to voluntary deductibles in the Netherlands. To do this, we extend our analysis for 18 year olds to the full population. We use a panel regression design that exploits annual variation in the size of the mandatory and voluntary deductibles. This allows us to quantify the cross subsidies: the part of the reduction (discount) in the insurance premium that is not due to increased out-of-pocket expenditure and reduced healthcare use because of the higher deductible. This reduction in the premium is due to selection of people with lower expected costs (due to imperfect risk adjustment). We estimate that allowing for a voluntary deductible of up to 500 euros leads to a cross subsidy from high-risk to low-risk individuals of between 38–80 euros per low-risk person per year.====Our research provides lessons for other countries that implement choice in demand-side cost-sharing in a competitive health insurance markets with community rating and (imperfect) risk adjustment. First, in general it is a good idea to impose a minimum generosity level in the health insurance market to prevent selection activities on low-risks and cross subsidies from high-risk to low-risk types. Second, the lower moral hazard effect, i.e. the lower responsiveness of expenditure with respect to the deductible, for people with a voluntary deductible implies that the minimum generosity level should be equal to the maximum generosity level in the Netherlands. This may also be the case in other countries. Einav et al. (2013) find a similar effect and coin this “selection on moral hazard”. Moreover, policy makers have to consider another problem of introducing voluntary cost-sharing schemes in competitive markets. If risk adjustment is imperfect then this may lead to selection effects which ultimately can result in unraveling markets (Cutler and Reber, 1998), and unintended cross subsidies between low-risk and high-risk individuals (Marzilli Ericson and Sydnor, 2017). For the Netherlands we find no evidence for a death spiral. As health insurance is mandatory in the Netherlands, a death spiral would not lead to uninsured citizens. Also, there is no evidence of a spiral in terms of insurers reducing coverage or provider networks. Apparently, the combination of mandatory health insurance together with a mandatory and maximum deductible level is sufficient to prevent any spiral developing. But we do find selection effects and fairly substantial cross subsidies.====Therefore, we conclude that policymakers should be reluctant to implement a voluntary cost-sharing scheme if there is already a mandatory cost-sharing scheme in place. If, unlike the Netherlands, generosity choice is seen as important by policy makers due to clear heterogeneity in risk aversion, implementing a voluntary deductible scheme can be optimal. But capping the voluntary deductible is likely to be welfare enhancing in this case as well.====In Section 2 we explain how we think about moral hazard, adverse selection and cross subsidies between low-risk and high-risk individuals in our paper and we derive a hypothesis we can test empirically. Section 3 describes the institutional setting of the Dutch healthcare sector. Section 4 explains our administrative data set and provides several descriptive statistics. We describe our empirical strategy in Section 5 and present our results in Section 6. Section 7 extends the sample to a larger age range for policy analyses.

Exploiting a staggered difference-in-differences setting for Europe combined with randomization inference, we find sharp increases in sales and manufacturers’ revenues of more than 90%. However, whilst not reducing abortions significantly, the policy triggers an unexpected increase in fertility of 4%, particularly among women aged 25–34. We elaborate on mechanisms by looking at within-country evidence from several EU countries, which suggests that fertility is driven by decreasing use of birth control pills in response to easier access to morning-after pills.","In 2012, 40% of all pregnancies worldwide were unintended. Half of them ended in an abortion, 10% ended in a miscarriage, and 40% resulted in an unplanned birth (Sedgh et al., 2014). There exists, however, a possibility to prevent an unintended pregnancy ==== sexual intercourse: emergency contraception (EC). The so-called morning-after pill, the predominant EC drug, gives women a second chance to prevent conception when a primary contraceptive method failed, no method was used, or sex was forced. The drug is effective up to five days after unprotected intercourse, but works more effectively the sooner it is taken. Consequently, many countries have changed access to EC pills from prescription-only to over-the-counter (OTC), meaning that the drug can be obtained in pharmacies directly without having to consult a doctor first. The intent behind these policy reforms is to simplify and, hence, accelerate access to the emergency drug, thereby reducing the number of unintended pregnancies. However, providing an easy way to prevent conception ex post could also decrease ex ante efforts in appropriately using regular contraceptives.====In this paper, we evaluate intended and unintended impacts of the switch to prescription-free access to morning-after pills. Precisely, we estimate causal effects on units sold, revenue figures, and specific health outcomes such as abortions, fertility, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). In a first step, we identify our effects of interest by exploiting regional and temporal variations in the OTC introduction of EC pills across ==== European countries and over ==== years, respectively. Throughout this difference-in-differences (DiD) approach, we account for the clustered data structure and the limited number of clusters (countries) by applying randomization inference (RI) to assess the significance of the effects. Moreover, to deal with the staggered adoption of treatment, we employ the stacked DiD method (Cengiz et al., 2019), and we address concerns and corresponding remedies from the recent econometric literature (e.g., Callaway and Sant’Anna, 2021, DeChaisemartin and d’Haultfoeuille, 2020, Goodman-Bacon, 2021, Sun and Abraham, 2021). In a second step, we focus on within-country evidence from Germany and other EU countries in order to elaborate on specific channels of our general findings. Particularly, we evaluate OTC effects on regular hormonal contraceptives.====In line with clear descriptive evidence, we find that prescription-free access to morning-after pills causes a sharp increase in the number of units sold as well as in revenues of ====% and ====%, respectively. Moreover, we cannot detect a stable and significant reduction in abortions with our population level data. Notably, however, we reveal a robust increase in birth rates and fertility of about ====%. By zooming in on age-group-specific fertility, we find that these effects are driven by the subgroup of women aged ==== to ==== and not by the suspected risk group, teenagers. When evaluating the effect of prescription-free access to EC pills on several STIs, we do not see any significant impact. This corroborates our findings on the relevant age group driving fertility, in the sense that ====- to ====-year-old females are supposedly in stable relationships rather than having frequently changing sexual partners. OTC access to EC pills might lead people to engage in having more, or more unprotected, sex through which unintended—but not unwanted—pregnancies emerge. For all outcomes, we (i) show that more conservative RI ====-values confirm the significance of our effects and (ii) examine effect dynamics by conducting event studies. In so doing, we demonstrate both persistent impacts over several post-treatment years as well as parallel pre-trends validating the plausibility of the common trends assumption. Eventually, within-country evidence for Germany confirms the effects found for Europe. Data on sales of the birth control pill and survey data on individual contraceptive behavior suggests that the birth control pill’s usage significantly declines with OTC access to the morning-after pill. Such a substitution from highly effective (ex ante) to less effective (ex post) contraceptive methods can explain our positive fertility effect. Further survey evidence uncovers an increase in unplanned newborns for the ==== to ==== age groups, which are driving the fertility effect.====While clinical trials have proven the effectiveness of EC pills, medical studies remain inconclusive concerning public health benefits in terms of, e.g., reduced unintended pregnancy rates in response to improved access to EC pills. Further, most of this literature does not consider prescription requirements and analyzes experimental data (Glasier and Baird, 1998, Glasier et al., 2004, Raymond et al., 2004, Raine et al., 2005, Raymond et al., 2007, Cleland et al., 2014). The majority of the economic literature analyzing observational data on prescription-free access to the morning-after pill finds no evidence that this reduces the number of abortions (Durrance, 2013, Girma and Paton, 2006, Girma and Paton, 2011, Gross et al., 2014, Mulligan, 2016, Zuppann, 2011). For specific settings, however, a few studies can show the intended effects of OTC access to EC pills, i.e., a reduction in abortions for very young women (aged 18 and 19 years) and a decline in birth rates of black women (Cintina and Johansen, 2015, Cintina, 2017, Koohi, 2013). Cintina and Johansen (2015) exploit the removal of prescription requirements for women aged 18 years or older occurring 2006 in the US. By using variation in accessibility across age groups, they find a reduction in abortion rates of 6%, concentrated among women aged 18. In a later study, Cintina (2017) examines the 1998 case of Washington and gives similar moderate decreases for a wider age range. However, this finding is at odds with what Durrance (2013) reports for Washington using different data and identification. Irrespective of any OTC context but by studying (free) availability of EC pills in Chile—a less developed country with very restrictive abortion laws—Bentancor and Clarke (2017) find significant reductions in illegal abortions and fertility, and these effects are especially pronounced for teenagers.==== Besides achieving the desired effect, policy interventions in general might also trigger unintended side effects. In contexts related to ours, e.g., HIV tests or the distribution of condoms in schools, the literature shows examples where well-intentioned measures backfire (Philipson and Posner, 1995, Buckles and Hungerman, 2018). Several studies investigating side effects of OTC access to EC pills focus on behavioral adaptions in the form of (riskier) sexual activity resulting in an increase of STIs. For instance, Durrance (2013), Girma and Paton (2011), Mulligan (2016), and Zuppann (2011) find higher (teenage) STI rates, and Mulligan (2016) additionally uses a survey of youth to show increases in (unprotected) sexual encounters. Moreover, Atkins and Bradford (2015a) analyze data on public school students from four New England states and find no effects on sexual activity or hormonal birth control use, but a significant reduction of condom use of 6%. Yet, another potential side effect is that more unprotected sexual intercourse might also increase unintended pregnancies, which might in turn increase abortions or even result in rising fertility. Thus, a few studies that analyze the consequences of OTC access to EC pills explicitly also consider births as an outcome variable (e.g., Gross et al., 2014, Durrance, 2013, Mulligan, 2016). Mulligan (2016) finds small but not robust reductions in birth rates of teenagers, together with stronger and significant increases in teenage STI rates and abortions rates. While finding increases in gonorrhea rates, Durrance (2013) does not detect significant effects on abortions and births. However, her data is limited to the age groups 15–19 and 20–24.====We build on this literature and make several contributions. While existing studies mostly focus on sub-populations within single countries, we conduct a Europe-wide analysis of OTC accessibility to EC pills. To the best of our knowledge, there is no research analyzing the effects of prescription-free access to morning-after pills on a multinational level. Such evidence is particularly missing for Europe, where ====% of all abortions from developed countries occurred in 2008, and where EC pills can offer an important remedy (Sedgh et al., 2012). In a necessary first step, we check whether simplified access leads to more frequent use of such drugs. Using registered pharmaceutical data, we causally evaluate impacts on units sold and manufacturers’ revenue. We then not only examine whether OTC access leads to the desired decline in unintended pregnancies, by looking at abortions, but also investigate other direct and indirect health outcomes to uncover potential side effects. This also means that we do not just focus on teenagers, but consider all women of childbearing age. In so doing, we are the first to document a stable increase in fertility due to prescription-free access to the morning-after pill. We further show that this rise is driven by women aged ====–====, who are likely to be in stable relationships. We confirm the significance of these DiD results by using randomization inference to deal with the small number of clusters issue, and by employing state-of-the-art procedures that provide a remedy to issues recently discussed by the literature on staggered treatment adoption. To complete the picture, we elaborate on underlying channels of the unexpected fertility effect by focusing on within-country settings, mainly zooming in on Germany. We contribute with new evidence on contraceptive behavior by exploiting rich pharmaceutical as well as survey data on both conventional hormonal contraceptives and emergency contraceptives. We are able to demonstrate that OTC access to the morning-after pill triggers a substitution between regular contraceptive pills and emergency contraceptive pills, explaining the observed rise in fertility. We can also show that this substitution channel holds true for other European countries, too.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows: In Section 2, we provide background information, introduce the data, and show descriptive evidence. In Section 3, we explain our across-country identification strategy and briefly introduce randomization inference. In Section 4, we present and discuss direct effects, age-group-specific impacts, potential side effects, as well as effect dynamics via event studies. In Section 5, we focus on Germany (and several other European countries) to elaborate on potential underlying channels by providing both descriptive and causal within-country evidence.

Approximately 70 percent of adults who survive to age 65 develop severe long-term care needs prior to death, defined as having difficulty with two or more activities of daily living (ADLs) expected to last at least 90 days, severe cognitive impairment, or receiving paid long-term care (ASPE 2019). Among this population, 60 percent need care for two years or more (ASPE 2019), which could consist of unpaid care provided by family members or friends, paid care provided at home, or residential care in nursing homes or assisted living facilities. Despite the large financial risk stemming from intensive and enduring care needs, insurance coverage is incomplete. Medicare covers short-term care needs after acute health events, such as hip fracture and stroke, but does not cover longer-term care needs due to chronic illnesses. Medicaid covers long-term care needs, but as a means-tested program, has stringent asset and income requirements. And private long-term care insurance (LTCI) coverage is low – only 7.5 million Americans have some form of long-term care insurance as of Jan 1, 2020––and the market is shrinking (AALTCI 2021).====As a result, many Americans face the choice of paying for care out of pocket or having their care needs met by unpaid caregivers, often spouses, children, or both. In all, $58.1 billion was spent out-of-pocket on home health care and nursing care facilities in 2019 in the US, representing one fifth of total LTC spending (CMS 2021). While the value of total unpaid care provided in the economy is more difficult to value, informal care is an important component of total LTC care provided. The costs of informal care may include reduced labor force participation and changes in location decisions among potential or current caregivers.====In this paper, we examine the role of private long-term care insurance, which reduces the price of formal care at the time of care, on family spillovers including informal caregiving, labor market outcomes, and geographic proximity to aging parents. On one hand, if informal care and formal care are complementary, and the presence of private insurance increases the use of formal care, demand for unpaid caregivers could increase. On the other hand, the reduced price of formal care services may lead people needing care to substitute away from informal care towards formal care. In this case, families – including potential caregivers – may reoptimize work and location decisions in response to lower caregiving expectations, and these effects may appear prior to a parent's care needs materializing.====An empirical challenge that arises when analyzing the impact of private long-term care insurance on family behavior is the potential endogeneity of LTCI. Endogeneity can arise due to the inability of the econometrician to observe, for example, health problems that could make both LTCI coverage and informal care use more likely, or risk aversion that may be associated with higher rates of LTCI coverage and better health (Finkelstein and McGarry 2006). To address the potential endogeneity problem and measure causal effects, we use an instrumental variables technique that exploits exogenous variation in LTCI ownership resulting from the plausibly exogenous implementation of state tax subsidies for LTCI.====Using this empirical strategy, we examine the causal impact of LTCI on a range of outcomes, including informal care use, parents’ perceived availability of informal caregivers, and the location and labor market decisions of their adult children. We find no evidence that LTCI reduces informal care use over an eight-year follow up period. However, we find evidence that LTCI causes respondents to be significantly less likely to report the availability of informal caregivers in the future, suggesting that parents change their expectations regarding informal caregivers.====Consistent with these changing expectations, our results indicate that the likelihood that an adult child coresides with parents is 82 percent lower when parents gain LTCI. We also find that LTCI causes a 34 percent increase in parents reporting all of their children to be working at all (full- or part-time) and a 42 percent increase in all children working full-time. Together, these findings suggest that LTCI ownership can confer economic gains to the next generation regardless of whether a LTC need arises.====Our findings build on several strands of related literature. First, one area of research investigates family interactions and intergenerational behavior around long-term care provision (Hiedemann and Stern 1999; Checkovich and Stern 2002; Engers and Stern 2002; Byrne et al., 2009; Heger 2017; Hiedemann et al., 2018). For example, one theory known as “intra-family moral hazard” is that parents do not buy LTCI because they prefer children to care for them and do not want to enter a nursing home (Pauly 1990). This theory suggests that if the cost of a parent accessing a nursing home were lower because of the purchase of insurance, children would change their behavior and be less likely to provide care. This model predicts a decline in informal care in response to holding LTCI.====Another related literature studies the relationship between informal and formal care use (Engers and Stern 2002; Van Houtven and Norton 2004; Charles and Sevak 2005; Van Houtven and Norton 2008). These studies generally find that receipt of informal care substantially reduces the risk of and/or delays nursing home entry, suggesting that informal care is a substitute for formal care services to a point. Informal care and formal care could also be complements (Bonsang 2009), however, as a drop in the formal care price could increase both formal and informal care, with a change in each leading to a different mix of use between the two resources (Coe et al., 2021). Some studies also show benefits to care recipients, including lower health care utilization and better health outcomes (Eloniemi-Sulkava et al., 2001; Van Houtven and Norton 2008; Goncalves and Weaver 2017; Costa-Font et al., 2018; Coe et al., 2019). However, there is evidence that providing care also comes at a cost to caregivers: caregivers experience worse health, reduced earnings and fewer labor market opportunities (Pruchno and Resch 1989; Schulz et al., 1995; Coe and Van Houtven 2009; Van Houtven, Coe et al. 2013; van den Berg, Fiebig et al. 2014; Bauer and Sousa-Poza 2015; Schmitz and Westphal 2015; Brenna and Di Novi 2016; de Zwart, Bakx et al. 2017; Heger 2017; Bom et al., 2019; Kolodziej et al., 2022). Recent adjacent literature shows that paid family leave can ameliorate the negative long-run effects of spousal disability on household labor supply (Anand et al., 2021).====Several studies seek to understand the determinants of LTCI coverage. Although factors such as Medicaid crowd-out, high administrative costs in a small market, market stability concerns, and incomplete coverage undoubtedly play a role in explaining low private coverage no single factor has been found to dominate, and both supply-side and demand-side explanations contribute (Brown and Finkelstein 2011; Stallard 2011; Brown et al., 2012).====Family relationships may also influence LTCI coverage decisions. Qualitative work finds that parents expressed buying LTCI because they did not want to burden their children with having to provide informal care, and LTCI would leave the role of children to provide attention but not caregiving (Broyles et al., 2016; Sperber et al., 2017). These motives are consistent with the findings in Brown et al. (2012), who show that 87 percent of respondents wished to not create a financial burden for family members if they needed LTC. However, it is also the case that the presence of potential informal caregivers is associated with lower demand for LTCI. For instance, several studies have documented LTCI coverage decreasing in the number of children (e.g. Mellor 2001).====Finally, there are a few studies that have studied the relationship between LTCI and formal care services. Konetzka et al. (2019) test for the presence of traditional moral hazard in the LTCI market by estimating the effect of LTCI on formal care use. They find evidence of moral hazard in formal home care, but not nursing home care. Prior work by Li and Jensen (2011) find modest effects of LTCI on the likelihood of using long-term care services, and no evidence that formal care substitutes for informal care in the presence of LTCI. A study in Japan found that an exogenous policy change introducing LTCI to older adults increased labor force participation of informal caregivers across all age groups, and especially among younger caregivers age 30–39 (8.7 percentage points) (Fu et al., 2017).====Our paper makes two key contributions to this literature. First, to our knowledge, our study is the first to exploit a source of exogenous variation in LTCI to investigate a variety of different family spillovers of LTCI in the U.S. context, including the use of informal care, work and co-residence decisions of adult children, and perceptions regarding the availability of informal care. Second, we provide evidence that insuring long-term care expenditures, or other similar reductions in the cost of formal care services, can impact family members of the insured, and that these effects may occur many years prior to when care is needed. These results highlight the need to account for potential spillovers of policy interventions to family members when assessing the costs and benefits of such interventions.====The rest of our paper proceeds as follows. Section II presents the data, sample selection criteria, and descriptive statistics. Section III describes the potential sources of endogeneity and our instrumental variables strategy. Section IV presents the main results and Section V reports the results of several sensitivity tests.

Around the same time, an unprecedented international effort has taken place to combat HIV/AIDS mortality with the expansion of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) across many of the hardest hit countries. In this paper, I estimate the impact of ART on average welfare over time in 42 countries using the equivalent consumption approach. I decompose the change in welfare to isolate the relative contribution of ART-driven improvements in life expectancy and consumption. The results indicate that ART has accounted for around 12% of total welfare growth in SSA between 2000 and 2017. In those countries most affected by HIV/AIDS, this figure rises to around 40%. Moreover, the estimates suggest that welfare in some of the worst-hit countries would have declined over time without the ART expansion.","Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is the focal point of the global HIV/AIDS pandemic. At the peak of the crisis, in 2004, the region reported around 1.3 million AIDS related deaths, accounting for almost 80% of the global total (UNAIDS, 2020b). While there is no cure for the disease, the progression of HIV and eventual onset of AIDS can be delayed with antiretroviral therapies (ART). These therapies have transformed HIV/AIDS from a death sentence into a manageable, chronic condition. Moreover, individuals infected with the disease can expect to live a near-normal lifespan, provided that they start ART early (Johnson et al., 2013). Up until the early 2000s, access to ART had been prohibitively expensive for many individuals and governments in SSA. With the development of low-cost generic ARTs at the start of the century, several international funding streams were set up in response to the crisis, notably through the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (2001) and the United States President’s Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) (2003). Still, the expansion of ART access across SSA was far from solely an international aid story. Considerable resources for ART programmes were also mobilised domestically, notably in countries such as Botswana and South Africa. By the end of 2020, there were over 18 million people receiving ART in SSA due to these combined international and domestic efforts (UNAIDS, 2020b). Evidence suggests that the roll-out of ART has substantially reduced HIV/AIDS mortality rates and improved life expectancies across the most affected countries (Bendavid and Bhattacharya, 2009, Bor et al., 2013). Furthermore, ART may have contributed to the “African growth miracle” by boosting labour productivity and the accumulation of human capital.==== Tompsett (2020), for instance, estimates that GDP growth in SSA would have been around a third lower without the expansion of ART coverage at the start of the century.====The aim of this paper is to quantify the relative contribution of ART to changes in welfare over time and across countries in SSA. From the outset, I define welfare in terms of consumption and life expectancy using the equivalent consumption approach (Usher, 1973, Usher, 1980).==== This approach estimates the hypothetical consumption that, if combined with some reference life expectancy, would make a representative agent indifferent to his/her current life (as defined by his actual consumption and survival conditions). The equivalent consumption (or income) has been applied in numerous contexts that are relevant to this paper, including the measurement of the welfare costs of HIV/AIDS (Crafts and Haacker, 2003, Soares, 2007, Fimpel and Stolpe, 2010), the value of health interventions (Murphy and Topel, 2003, Hall and Jones, 2007) and between-country welfare inequality (Becker et al., 2005, Fleurbaey and Gaulier, 2009, Jones and Klenow, 2016).====To measure the contribution of ART to welfare, I construct a counterfactual scenario which describes country-specific trajectories of life expectancy at birth and consumption in the absence of the ART expansion. I employ the demographic and epidemiological modelling tool Spectrum (Stover et al., 2010) to estimate counterfactual “no-ART” life expectancies at birth. This tool is often utilised by statistical agencies, such as the World Health Organisation, to model the impact of HIV/AIDS on mortality in low income countries and has been applied in previous studies assessing the benefits of ART (Forsythe et al., 2019, Lamontagne et al., 2019). I predict counterfactual “no-ART” consumption trajectories using the empirical model of Tompsett (2020), which controls for country- and time-specific fixed effects as well as possible sources of endogeneity bias emanating, for instance, from differences in how effectively countries have expanded ART coverage. Following this, I calculate the equivalent consumption measure under the actual and counterfactual scenarios, which allows me to isolate the relative contribution of ART to welfare in each country.====While several studies have estimated the value of ART-related income gains (Resch et al., 2011, Tompsett, 2020)==== and/or welfare benefits of mortality reductions (Bor et al., 2013, Forsythe et al., 2019, Lamontagne et al., 2019), this is the first paper, to my knowledge, to directly estimate the contribution of ART to welfare through the combined channels of improved life expectancy and consumption. This is salient because economic theory suggests that welfare at a given point in time depends more directly on consumption rather than income.==== Consumption may also be a better indicator of long term welfare trends in developing countries.==== This paper also moves beyond programme-specific cost-benefit analyses of ART (e.g. Resch et al., 2011, Forsythe et al., 2019, Lamontagne et al., 2019) by estimating the contribution of ART to average welfare over time. This perspective is important because it weights the benefits of ART-relative to prevailing trends in other factors that affect welfare through life expectancy and consumption. For instance, some countries may have been worse off over time in the absence of the ART expansion, a facet that would not be captured by a standard cost–benefit analysis of an ART programme. Lastly, this paper explores cross-country heterogeneity in the value of ART gains, which may be relevant for comparing countries with different sized HIV epidemics and/or those that have been comparatively more successful in rolling out ART among their populations. It therefore builds on previous works that have been primarily focused on the regional (e.g. SSA) or global benefits of ART.====Regarding the value of ART, this analysis yields several key insights using a relatively conservative set of parameter assumptions. First, ART has driven large welfare gains within many SSA countries over time. On average, across the region, these welfare gains equate to 2 additional percentage points of consumption growth per year (0.6–4.4 percentage points across sensitivity analyses). This means that ART has contributed to around 12% of total welfare growth (5%–18% across sensitivity analyses) in SSA between 2000 and 2017. Second, there is substantial heterogeneity in the value of ART gains across countries, particularly between those with high and low HIV prevalence rates. In the former, the value of ART-driven improvements in longevity and consumption is equivalent to an additional 3.5 percentage points of consumption growth per annum (1.0–7.2 percentage points across sensitivity analyses). This compares with 1.7 percentage points in countries with low HIV prevalence (0.4–3.0 percentage points across sensitivity analyses). Third, the estimates suggest that average welfare would have actually declined or stagnated over time without the expansion of ART in some of the worst affected countries (e.g. Eswatini, Lesotho, South Africa and Zimbabwe). Fourth, the results imply that the value of ART is chiefly derived from improvements in longevity rather than consumption gains, with the former accounting for over 70% of the total (28%–82% across sensitivity analyses). This further highlights the need to take a multidimensional approach to welfare measurement.====The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 introduces the equivalent consumption approach. Section 3 provides an overview of the data and describes the calibration of the model. Section 4 presents the results and the relative contribution of ART to welfare change. Section 5 tests the sensitivity of the results to different parameter assumptions. Section 6 discusses the strengths and weaknesses of the empirical approach. Section 7 presents some concluding remarks.",Estimating the welfare gains from anti-retroviral therapy in Sub-Saharan Africa,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629623000541,Available online 5 June 2023,2023,Research Article,4.0

In particular, many markets have evolved to produce a range of products that offer higher quality and amenities to those with sufficient willingness to pay (Schwartz 2020). Some pricing strategies to improve allocative efficiency and maximize profit are not very controversial: airline status for frequent flyers, loyalty and rewards programs for repeatedly engaging with a brand, or two-part tariffs in wholesale and online retail, for example. The efficiency and equity consequences of other pricing developments are less clear, particularly in areas more closely tied to goods such as education, criminal justice, and health.====Motivated by these issues, we study a growing trend in the health care industry that provides greater access to care for those willing to pay an additional retainer fee. The contracts are often called “concierge medicine” and resemble a membership model: patients receive same-day appointments with the physician, longer visits, and other amenities in return for a membership fee. Physicians reduce the number of patients they routinely see to devote more attention to patients paying the fee.==== While such pricing models are common in markets for many professional services (e.g., financial advisors, lawyers), they have historically been absent for physician services. Survey evidence estimates 7 percent of U.S. adults are enrolled in a concierge practice (Blendon et al., 2020). Despite the growth of the model, research on concierge medicine is sparse, likely due to data limitations and its recent emergence.====In theory, concierge medicine can serve as a vehicle for improved efficiency. It provides a price mechanism to segment the population based on the value that different patients place on access, as reflected in willingness to pay.==== This new model may improve health outcomes if willingness to pay reflects the sensitivity of the patient's health to improved access, and scarce provider time can be allocated to patients for whom increased attention is most beneficial. For example, more time and access to the physician may reduce expensive costs like emergency room use and hospital admissions (van Loenen et al. 2014). On the other hand, health may not improve if willingness to pay instead reflects the value patients derive from other attributes of the model, such as convenience, service excellence, or amenities. In addition, patients who do not pay the membership fee (which we also refer to as the retainer fee) experience discontinuities in care that may be detrimental to health. Some people have raised equity concerns about sorting based on wealth.====In this paper, we empirically analyze concierge medicine using Medicare insurance claims merged with novel data from a large concierge medicine company. We combine Medicare insurance claims with information on the exact timing of over 225 physicians switching to concierge medicine, provided by a large company that manages concierge practices. We use detailed claims information to first document the nature of patient selection into concierge medicine based on patient health status and income (at the zip-code level) prior to the switch. We employ machine learning methods to classify patients into groups of better or worse health according to their spending predicted by demographics and diagnoses of chronic conditions.====We then measure the change in spending and mortality through a series of event studies. Our identification strategy leverages the staggered timing of physicians switching from traditional models of primary care to concierge medicine. We compare patients of physicians who switch during our study period to observationally similar patients of physicians who switch to the same concierge company after our study period, using coarsened exact matching (Blackwell et al., 2009; Iacus et al., 2011). Our main analysis focuses on all patients of the physician's practice, regardless of whether they pay the fee to join or do not pay the fee and exit. We subsequently analyze the experiences of patients who elect to pay the membership fee and those who do not and leave the practice.====The health care industry adds important context to study these issues because it is the largest sector of the economy, and because it is one where many people question whether scarce resources should be allocated based on willingness to pay. Within the health care industry, primary care provides an important setting to study concierge medicine. Many patients place a high value on the relationship with their primary care physician (Sabety 2022) and issues of access and how to best allocate primary care providers are highly salient (Tai-Seale and McGuire 2012). Unlike specialists, primary care physicians perform few procedures that are highly reimbursed, and instead generate revenues primarily on patient volume. Physicians in traditional practices often spend less than 15 minutes with each patient, in part because insurers do not generously reimburse longer visits (Yawn et al., 2003; Irving et al., 2017). Rushed appointments are a source of dissatisfaction by both patients and physicians and contribute to an increased prevalence of physician burnout, which exacerbates an existing shortage of primary care physicians (Bodenheimer 2010; Prasad et al., 2020).==== Recent studies point to reductions in quality of care due to time pressures among primary care physicians (Neprash 2017; Freedman et al., 2021). Such time pressures are fundamentally linked to the high cost of care in the U.S., as shorter visits may mean insufficient time to listen, diagnose, and solve problems, which can result in excess testing, unnecessary prescriptions, and frequent referrals to specialists (Linzer et al., 2015).====Our paper has three main findings. First, there is limited patient selection into concierge medicine based on health status. We find evidence that income (at the level of patient zip code) has a stronger influence on the decision for patients to pay the retainer fee to join. Second, concierge medicine increases total health care spending. The increase is large starting in the year after the switch and grows to 30–50% higher compared to before the switch. Third, we find no evidence that concierge medicine leads to mortality changes, on average.====This paper is the first within the economics literature to study selection into concierge medicine and empirically measure its effects on health care spending and mortality. The subject has received policy discussion in the popular press and medical journals.==== A handful of studies in medical journals, mostly performed in collaboration with the leadership of concierge medicine companies, have documented its members have significantly higher satisfaction rates from their encounters with their physician and reductions in hospitalization rates (Klemes et al., 2012; Klemes and Solomon 2015; Morefield et al., 2020). These studies’ research designs do not account for selection and do not study patients who elect not to join concierge medicine, limiting what inferences can be drawn from the results. While other studies have examined different aspects of allocative efficiency in health care, such as the ability of market forces to steer consumers to higher-quality hospitals (Chandra et al., 2016) or to match patients to surgeons who specialize in different treatments (Chandra and Staiger 2007), our focus on primary care—the most common point of contact for patients in the health care system—can inform broader discussions about current and future access to preventative care. Our paper also relates more broadly to the literature on non-linear pricing in markets for products and services.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 lays out a conceptual framework of patient selection into concierge medicine and the implications of selection for population health. Section 3 describes the specific concierge medicine company we study and provides an overview of the data and descriptive statistics. Section 4 analyzes selection into concierge medicine and Section 5 presents results for spending and mortality using the matched sample.

Partnerships and mergers in this sector have become increasingly popular ($533 billion in 2019, up 26% from 2018, according to Fortune).==== The profitability of these deals has been facilitated by factors like strong demographic tailwinds, high industry fragmentation, innovation, evolving regulations, and new business models to manage medical care.====Industry actors, such as hospitals, pharmacies and insurance companies, often make strategic investments and acquisitions to improve healthcare access, reduce costs, and improve quality: Dranove and Lindrooth (2003), examining mergers of previously independent hospitals, find that they experience post-merger cost decreases of 14% on average.==== These potential efficiencies, which are likely to benefit consumers, often come along with increased concentration, which may consolidate market power and raise competitive concerns in a sector historically exposed to media and public opinion attention. As a result, many mergers in the healthcare sector undergo close scrutiny by competition authorities on both sides of the Atlantic.====Yet, many of the existing economic techniques to evaluate mergers in fully privatized industries (e.g., Diversion Ratio, Merger Simulation and The Gross Upward Pricing Pressure Index) are unsuited for the healthcare sector. The reason lies in the mixed-oligopoly nature of this industry. In most developed and developing countries, private healthcare providers compete with public providers whose objective is not necessarily profit maximization, and whose conduct is usually distorted by regulatory constraints meant to improve access to high quality healthcare services: Barigozzi and Burani (2016), Barros and Siciliani (2011), and Laine and Ma (2017), among others, offer an account of the empirical evidence showing substitutability between public and private healthcare providers.====How should mergers be evaluated in mixed oligopolies? Does the presence of public healthcare providers make it more likely that a merger between privatized providers benefits consumers? What is the impact of alternative public providers’ regulatory constraints and motivations on the competitive effects of these mergers?====To answer these questions, we build a mixed-oligopoly model in which a publicly owned healthcare provider competes for patients with two privatized providers, who may eventually merge. Our main task is to assess the effects of such a merger on consumers’ well being. We consider a circular-city model à la Salop (1979) in which patients are uniformly distributed around a circle of unit perimeter and buy a single treatment from healthcare providers that are located equidistantly around the circle and compete by setting prices and healthcare quality.====We contribute to the growing literature on mixed oligopolies in the healthcare industry by showing that the assessment of the competitive effects of horizontal mergers between private healthcare providers facing competition from a public provider requires identifying: ==== whether the public provider is free to choose its price and quality or those are given by regulation; and ==== the objectives of the public provider and, in particular, the extent to which it is mandated to maximize its own profits or, instead, to ensure that consumers have access to low-price and high-quality services.====When the price and quality of the public provider are regulated, the merger eliminates a competitive constraint as in fully privatized markets, but the reaction of the public healthcare provider is very different from that of a third private competitor, as the public healthcare provider cannot increase its price or reduce its quality in response to the merger, as a private competitor would do. Thus, the merged entity will be less likely to increase prices or reduce quality post-merger for fear of losing significant volume to the public sector. Furthermore, a more substantial share of any merger synergies will be passed on to consumers, who are more likely to benefit from the merger when the price-adjusted quality standard imposed on the public provider is sufficiently high. In short, other things being equal, the merger is more likely to be consumer surplus increasing (hereafter, CS-increasing) in a mixed oligopoly with a regulated public provider than in a fully privatized marked (without the public provider).====When, instead, the public provider can adjust its price and quality in response to changes in its rivals’ choices, and maximizes a weighted sum of its profits and aggregate patients’ well-being (i.e., it exhibits ‘semi-altruistic’ preferences),==== the merger is less likely to produce material anticompetitive effects if the public provider is sufficiently altruistic. When the public healthcare provider mostly cares about the well-being of patients, its response to the merger will be to cut its prices and increase its quality. Anticipating the procompetitive response of the altruistic public provider, the merged entity will also have the incentive to pass on a more significant share of any cost-synergies to consumers.====We then consider the more realistic intermediate case of a semi-regulated public provider, who can adjust the quality of its services in response to the merger, but is mandated by regulation to price below costs. We find that the merger is more likely to benefit consumers when the public provider is price-regulated than when it can change its price in response to the merger. This is because, prices being strategic complements, the merged providers have weaker incentives to increase their prices when knowing that their publicly owned rival cannot do the same.====The level of efficiencies required for the merger to be procompetitive drops also if consumers cannot observe services’ quality before choosing which provider to patronize, or there is asymmetric substitutability between public and private healthcare services, with the former being a stronger competitor. Provided the public provider is sufficiently altruistic, efficiencies may not be required for the merger to be CS-increasing when, alternatively: ==== private providers also feature semi-altruistic preferences; ==== consumers’ aggregate demand is elastic to prices and quality levels; ==== all prices are regulated, hence providers only compete on quality. Taken together, these results show that ignoring the presence of the public sector may lead to excessive enforcement (Type I errors) and harm consumers — i.e., mergers that should be blocked in fully privatized markets may be CS-increasing when the public sector is a key player.====We also consider a few aspects related to the industry post-merger dynamics. First, we examine the incentives of the merged parties to relocate. We find that they have an incentive to move closer to the public provider to gain more ‘captive’ consumers. This strategy hurts the welfare of the consumers who are served by the public system pre-merger and by the private sector post-merger. Therefore, the analysis implies that possible remedies public authorities may consider is to mandate merged providers not to reposition their products in the market. Finally, we show that the effect of the merger on entry is ambiguous and depends on the location choice of the entrant. We characterize a non-empty region of parameters in which the merger is profitable, spurs entry and benefits consumers at the same time. In this region, when entering the market, the new provider will contest for consumers that would buy either from the public provider or from one of its rivals in the absence of entry.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. After reviewing the related literature in Section 2, we describe the model set-up in Section 3. Section 4 develops the analysis under different regulatory regimes for the public provider. Section 5 considers several extensions of the model. Section 6 concludes. Proofs are in Appendix A.

A large literature examines how concentration affects consumers with private insurance and Medicare. However, there is scant evidence on how decreasing market competition affects low-income Americans, particularly those covered by Medicaid. Medicaid typically reimburses health care providers at lower rates than do private insurers, resulting in large gaps in care between Medicaid and other patients. Whether decreased competition reduces or exacerbates inequalities in use and outcomes is theoretically ambiguous. Concentration, which is driven by mergers among other factors, allow hospitals to gain market power and command higher reimbursement rates from private insurers (Gaynor et al., 2015; Dranove and Lindrooth, 2003; Vogt and Town, 2006; Capps and Dranove, 2004; Gaynor and Town, 2011; Haas-Wilson and Garmon, 2011; Vita and Sacher, 2001; Dafny et al., 2019). This could lead to larger gaps between private and Medicaid payment rates, and a renewed focus on privately insured patients at the expense of Medicaid patients. Alternatively, hospitals might use surplus revenue to cross-subsidize care for low-income Medicaid populations (David et al., 2014). Finally, economies of scale and efficiencies resulting from hospital consolidation could lead to expanded and improved care for all populations.====To investigate this question, we estimate the effects of hospital market concentration on hospital-based inpatient care for Medicaid patients in New York State from 2006 to 2012. New York State is an ideal setting for this analysis because it has a large Medicaid population and has experienced substantial consolidation (Huckman, 2006).====We measure effects of concentration on the number and proportion of hospitals’ inpatient stays for Medicaid patients. Our analyses focus on inpatient volume because inpatient care accounts for a large proportion of Medicaid spending and access to care is a key policy concern for low-income patients. Among other factors, barriers to access stem from providers’ limited financial incentive to treat Medicaid patients. Prices for Medicaid patients are largely tied to state-regulated fee-for-service reimbursement rates while prior research finds that increases in hospital market concentration lead to rising private insurance prices. This difference means that concentration could further disincentivize providers from serving Medicaid patients by widening the reimbursement rate gap between Medicaid and private payers.====We first construct a hospital-specific Herfindahl-Hirschmann Index (HHI)-based measure of market concentration. Because hospitals can operate across multiple service and geographic markets with varying levels of competition, our hospital-specific measure of concentration accounts for each hospital's geographic and service mix (Capps et al., 2017). To test our hypothesis that hospitals’ greater bargaining power with private insurers could impact Medicaid volumes, our measure of concentration is based on admissions for privately insured patients. We conduct falsifications using Medicare-based HHI.====We find that controlling for fixed hospital characteristics, an increase in hospital-specific HHI is associated with a relative decrease in the number of Medicaid patients a hospital admits: a 1% increase in HHI leads to a 0.6% relative decrease in the number of Medicaid patients admitted by a hospital. Decreases were observed in labor and delivery (birth) admissions, the most common reason for admission in Medicaid, and to a lesser extent in non-birth admissions. Because several factors could contribute to changes in market concentration, we construct an alternate measure, which isolates variation in HHI over time to only that caused by hospital mergers or acquisitions. We find evidence that mergers lead to hospital-level decreases in birth admissions for Medicaid beneficiaries, though not for non-birth admissions.====We test whether hospital-level decreases in our main analysis reflect redistribution of patients across hospitals or overall declines in the likelihood of a Medicaid admission at any hospital. We find very small decreases in total admissions for non-birth admissions. In heterogeneity analyses, we find that increased market concentration is associated with declines in Medicaid volume for non-profit hospitals but increased volume for public hospitals, suggesting that public hospitals may absorb Medicaid volume in response to increasing market concentration.====We investigate a potential mechanism by which hospitals in more concentrated markets could engage in screening out Medicaid admissions. For birth admissions, we find that an increase in market concentration is associated with a within-hospital decrease in attending physicians who serve higher shares of Medicaid patients. This association suggests that hospitals may achieve reductions in Medicaid volumes via changes in the types of physicians granted admitting privileges. However, we note that the same empirical pattern could also be consistent with the physicians who serve high shares of Medicaid patients selecting out of hospitals in more concentrated markets.====Our results indicate that increasing hospital market concentration affects health care for Medicaid patients and suggests the need for a more comprehensive and inclusive definition of the consumer in antitrust review of hospital merger cases, beyond the privately insured market segments traditionally analyzed. In particular, our analyses support previous findings that non-profit hospitals do not use surplus from greater bargaining power to invest in safety net populations. Moreover, decreasing market competition may increase strain on public hospitals through a shift in Medicaid admissions.====Our work relates to several strands of research. We contribute to the literature on hospital consolidation and competition by empirically investigating impacts on volumes, with a focus on low-income populations insured by Medicaid. A large body of evidence demonstrates that lack of competition in the health care delivery system increases insurer-negotiated prices for health care services as providers gain bargaining power (Cooper et al., 2019; Vogt and Town, 2006). Increasing prices paid by private insurers may widen the gap in hospitals’ profitability from admitting privately insured patients versus patients insured by payers with lower reimbursement rates, like Medicaid. To our knowledge, there has not been previous examination of the effects of market concentration and competition on health care use by Medicaid patients, despite the fact that state Medicaid programs cover about a fifth of the population nationally (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2018; Torio and Moore, 2016).====More generally, there is little evidence on the distributional impacts of heightened merger activity. Economists have debated whether or not corporate mergers exacerbate inequality and differentially harm low-income individuals in the economy writ large. These concerns are particularly salient in health care, given our reliance on hospitals to serve patients with varying levels of insurance generosity (Furman and Orszag, 2015; Roberts, 2012). The work examining impacts of increased market concentration on inequality has examined wage suppression as a mechanism (Prager and Schmitt, 2019). We contribute to this work by examining how changes in market competition as a result of hospital mergers may impact disparities in hospital care use.====Finally, research focused on multi-payer health care markets has found evidence that changes in demand (for example, due to insurance expansions) often affect payer mix (Kolstad and Kowalski, 2012; Joynt et al., 2013; Glied and Hong, 2018). However, it is unclear how providers screen out patients. In this work, we investigate mechanisms by which hospitals may achieve reduced Medicaid admissions. We find evidence suggesting that hospitals may limit labor and delivery admissions by withholding admitting privileges for physicians serving high shares of Medicaid patients, though we note that other factors such as changes in physician preferences could also explain reduced admissions among Medicaid-focused physicians.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses relevant theoretical frameworks. Section 3 describes our data sources and sample construction. Section 4 presents our main analyses. Section 5 presents analyses on effects by hospital ownership and Section 6 presents analyses on admitting privileges as a potential mechanism underlying the main effects.

By exploiting a quasi-experiment on the public LTCI ==== program in China, we identify the effect of LTCI using a triple-difference approach. Using longitudinal data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, we find that LTCI has led to an increase in the non-health consumption of elderly households by 15.7%, mostly observed in households having no older members with need for long-term care (LTC). Further evidence suggests that the effects are stronger for households with higher expected LTC risks, less wealth or family insurance, and covered by more generous schemes. Finally, LTCI increases the expectation of using formal LTC when disabled and subjective longevity expectations for older adults having no need for LTC. Overall, these findings offer empirical support for the role of LTCI in mitigating precautionary savings against LTC risks.","Given the high rate of global population aging, long-term care (LTC) needs have become an increasingly important policy concern, and at the same time, posed substantial risks for elderly households. LTC costs accounted for between one-half to five times the median disposable income of older adults aged 65 and over in OECD countries (OECD, 2020). A growing body of research suggests that elderly households save precautionarily to self-insure against LTC risks, which is a quantitatively plausible driver of the observed high savings rates among elderly households (İmrohoroğlu and Zhao, 2018; Ameriks et al., 2020). Therefore, social insurance for LTC can have important implications for the consumption, wealth decumulation, and welfare of older adults (Ariizumi, 2008; Kopecky and Koreshkova, 2014). Although compelling in theory, empirical evidence on the response of consumption and savings decisions of elderly households to universal long-term care insurance (LTCI) remains limited (Brown and Finkelstein, 2011). This study investigates the effect of the recent pilots of China's public LTCI program on the non-health consumption of elderly households, with the aim of examining the role of LTCI in reducing the need for precautionary savings against LTC risks.====The LTC-dependent older population has been growing rapidly in China. In 2020, the proportion of older adults aged 65 and over comprised 13.5% (190.65 million) of the total population, and older adults with activities of daily living (ADL) disability were estimated to account for 26.2% of the older adult population (Zheng et al., 2022). Moreover, the average number of years lived with a disability was 5.78 years for older adults in 2015 and is expected to reach 7.44 years in 2030 (Luo et al., 2021). In addition, LTC costs are substantial and the average annual expenditure on caregiving for individuals in LTC status accounts for 26%–37% of per capita GDP in China (İmrohoroğlu and Zhao, 2018). High costs of LTC impose heavy financial burdens on households with LTC-dependent older members. Without social protection, most disabled older adults would be unable to afford LTC, leaving them with unmet LTC needs.====To alleviate the economic burden of households with LTC-dependent older members, the Chinese government officially launched LTCI pilot programs in 15 prefecture-level cities in 2016, and expanded to another 14 prefecture-level cities in 2020, with the continued aim to steadily establish a public LTCI system as a major social safety net program for older adults in China. The program aims to assure affordable care services to disabled older adults and relieve the caregiving burden of family members. During the pilot stage, the LTCI was mainly financed by existing public health insurance programs and targeted older adults enrolled in these programs. The pilot LTCI program usually covered three types of care services for qualified beneficiaries: home- and community-based care, institutional care, and hospital care. By 2018, the LTCI benefits provided an average annual reimbursement of 9200 RMB (US$1400) per beneficiary, which was generous and amounted to 1.5 times the median annual income per capita of elderly households in China.====Theoretically, there are three channels through which public LTCI coverage may affect the consumption and savings decisions of elderly households. First, LTCI can reduce the risk of unexpected LTC expenditure, and thus, discourage precautionary savings and increase current consumption (Kimball, 1990). Second, LTCI can increase the expected net income of elderly households since some pilot programs receive government subsidies. This potential income effect will increase both consumption and savings. Third, LTCI reduces the price of LTC services and encourage older adults in need of LTC to use more formal LTC services; however, its impacts on the (expected) out-of-pocket LTC expenditure and non-health consumption expenditure of households are uncertain, depending on the price elasticity of demand for LTC services. Taken together, we expect that LTCI will raise the non-health consumption of elderly households without disabled members (potential beneficiaries) if the precautionary saving effect plays a dominate role. However, LTCI may have an ambiguous effect on the consumption of households with disabled members (actual beneficiaries).====To identify the impact of LTCI, we employ a triple-difference strategy by exploiting three sources of variation: the exogenous temporal and spatial variations in the LTCI pilot programs across cities from 2014 to 2018 and the variation in LTCI coverage across households with different health insurance types. Specifically, we use non-targeted households both within and outside the pilot cities to control for city-specific trends and use targeted households in the non-pilot cities to control for health insurance-specific trends in consumption in the absence of LTCI pilot programs. This design allows us to attribute any changes in consumption of the targeted elderly households in the pilot cities to the introduction of LTCI. Our results provide strong evidence supporting the parallel trend assumption and are robust to accounting for the concern regarding non-random individual LTCI exposure based on pre-existing health insurance types, accounting for the issue of treatment effect heterogeneity either over time or across groups in staggered difference-in-differences (DID) designs, and using alternative measures and sample specifications.====Using longitudinal data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) from 2011 to 2018, we show that the LTCI pilot programs have led to an increase in non-health consumption expenditure of eligible elderly households by 15.7%. We find a stronger effect on non-health consumption and a significant decrease in savings rate for elderly households without disabled members, which provides supporting evidence for the precautionary savings hypothesis. Furthermore, the effects of the pilot programs on non-health consumption are greater for elderly households with higher expected LTC risks, less wealth or family insurance, and covered by more generous LTCI programs. These results are all consistent with the precautionary savings explanation.====To better understand the mechanisms driving the main results derived from the reduced-form estimation, we also explore the associations between LTCI coverage and (expected) utilization of formal LTC services among older adults with (without) ADL limitations. LTCI coverage is significantly positively associated with home- and community-based LTC service use among severely disabled older adults. For older adults without ADL limitations, LTCI has significantly increased their expectation of using formal LTC when disabled and the expectation of living 11–15 more years.====This study makes contributions to the existing literature in three ways. First, we examine the impact of public LTCI on the well-being of elderly households in the largest developing economy in the world. Universal public LTCI programs have been introduced in a few developed countries such as Japan, Germany, Korea, Luxembourg, and Austria, which have witnessed a rapidly aging population over the last two decades.==== Additionally, a number of middle-income and developing countries have considered designing and developing a financing system for LTC (Rhee et al., 2015; Chandoevwit and Wasi, 2020). However, many pertinent issues regarding public LTCI have not been well understood (Brown and Finkelstein, 2011). Our findings provide novel insights into policy debates regarding the establishment and expansion of a comprehensive LTCI system in middle-income and developing countries.====Furthermore, this study complements the existing literature on the impacts of public LTCI (e.g., Kim and Lim, 2015; Fu et al., 2017; Costa-Font et al., 2018; Moura, 2022; Serrano-Alarcón et al., 2022) by shedding light on the response of the consumption and savings decisions of elderly households.==== Recent studies on China's LTCI pilot programs suggest that LTCI has significantly reduced healthcare utilization and expenditure (Lu et al., 2020; Feng et al., 2020a; Chen and Ning, 2022) and improved health outcomes of older adults in need of care (Lei et al., 2022). However, few studies examine the effect of LTCI on consumption and savings of elderly households, which is important not only for assuring the well-being of older adults in China but also for understanding how LTCI may affect the macroeconomy of the country.====Second, this study contributes to the body of research regarding the effects of social insurance programs on the consumption and savings of households (e.g., Gruber and Yelowitz, 1999; Engen and Gruber, 2001; Chou et al., 2003; Bronchetti, 2012; Liu, 2016; Lachowska and Myck, 2018). While most of these studies have highlighted the roles of social insurance in reducing precautionary savings and smoothing consumption, this study provides new evidence on the importance of LTCI in stimulating consumption by mitigating the need for precautionary savings against uncertain future LTC risks in elderly households.====Third, our findings add to the extensive literature on China's high household savings rate. Recent studies have emphasized the importance of precautionary saving motives in explaining the high savings rate in China (Meng, 2003; Chamon and Prasad, 2010; Feng et al., 2011; Chamon et al., 2013; He et al., 2018).==== Particularly, İmrohoroğlu and Zhao (2018) show the quantitative importance of the precautionary motive of saving against the LTC risks in China through a structural macroeconomic analysis. Our work complements İmrohoroğlu and Zhao (2018) by providing empirical evidence for this hypothesis based on a quasi-experiment. These findings advance the understanding of consumption and savings decisions made by older adults and offer useful policy insights not only for China but also for other rapidly aging populations and developing countries.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

Our identification strategy leverages the Alaksa Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD), which is distributed annually in October and comprises 6% of the average household's annual income. We study the impact of the PFD on the use of ","In 2021, half of Americans reported delaying or foregoing health care due cost reasons (Kearney et al., 2021). Significant efforts have been devoted to addressing cost-related barriers to care, including improving price transparency, subsidizing care, mandating free preventive care, insurance reform, alternative payment models, billing reform, and antitrust efforts. These policies mainly aim to reduce the price of health care; however, an additional policy option to improve affordability is to relax consumer budget constraints. Providing income is a policy option that is gaining popularity as a potential solution to a variety of societal problems (Hoynes and Rothstein, 2019). In the context of health care, households without liquid assets to pay for deductibles, co-payments, and other out-of-pocket costs may be especially likely to delay or forego care.====In this paper, we study the effect of a large cash distribution on health care consumption in a sample of individuals with employer-sponsored health insurance. Cost-related barriers are a problem for this group as 47% of commercially-insured individuals report difficulty affording medical care (Kearney et al., 2021). We study the effect of this cash distribution on a specific type of health care use – prescription medications. Prescription medication is an essential component of medical care, used in cases of immediate need for treating acute conditions as well as for long-term management of chronic diseases. Compared to other forms of medical care, patients generally have more control over their use of medication. Moreover, consumption of medication may be constrained as one in four Americans report difficulty affording their prescription medication (Kearney et al., 2021).====We exploit the arrival of the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD), which is an annual cash infusion received by all Alaska residents. The magnitude of the payment is large at approximately $1500 per household member and comprises 6% of the average family's annual income. It is both universal (i.e., given to nearly everyone)==== and unconditional (i.e., no restrictions on how the funds are used). Our data is the 2013 to 2019 MarketScan Research Outpatient Prescription Drug Database containing prescriptions for Alaska residents with employer-based health insurance. The sample contains 742,711 days of prescription fills by 50,866 individuals. The sample is large, comprising nearly 5% of Alaskans who have employer-sponsored health insurance in 2013 (Table 1). Our identification strategy leverages the fact that the dividend is disbursed on the first Thursday of October to create a withinAlaska comparison group. We compare changes in prescriptions in the 14-day window on either side of the October PFD distribution to changes in prescriptions in the 14-day window on either side of the first Thursday of other months of the year in a difference-in-differences design. Our main analysis relies on within Alaska variation, which cannot rule out an October effect.==== Therefore, we expand our sample to include other states and use a synthetic control analysis to find a convex set of states that act as an Alaska counterfactual.====We find no effects of the PFD on the total number of prescriptions filled and can rule out effects larger than 0.5% in the week of the Alaska PFD and 1.4% in the week after. Individuals who face higher out-of-pocket costs for medication may be more sensitive to changes in liquidity, so we estimate effects separately for branded versus generic prescriptions and for groups that face different degrees of cost sharing. Individuals with high deductible health plans reduce prescriptions in the two weeks prior to the PFD then increase prescriptions in the week after the PFD; however, the latter result is not statistically significant and may be due to noise in the data so we encourage caution in interpreting this result. We find no changes in generic or branded prescriptions, for individuals not enrolled in a high deductible health plan, or for individuals with varying levels of out-of-pocket costs. Receipt of the PFD has been found to increase alcohol and drug related mortality (Evans and Moore, 2011) and arrests (Watson et al., 2019), suggesting that behavioral changes could cause consumption of acute condition medications or first-time prescriptions to increase. Likewise, if patients are delaying drugs required to manage an ongoing health concern, evidence would be found through changes in refills and prescriptions for chronic conditions. We find no evidence of changes in consumption of acute, chronic, first prescriptions, or refills around the date of the PFD. Lastly, we conduct a synthetic control analysis using a control group of individuals with employer sponsored health insurance from outside Alaska. Results of the synthetic control analysis are consistent with the findings of our main analysis, showing no effect of the PFD on prescription use.====We contribute to the relatively small literature on the effects of cash transfers on health care consumption. Past research finds that liquidity increases are associated with increased visits to medical providers (Holmes et al., 2018), hospitalizations (Dobkin and Puller, 2007; Forget, 2013; Gross and Tobacman, 2014; Holmes et al., 2018), and prescriptions (Lyngse, 2020; Gross et al., 2022); however, increases in liquidity are not always associated with changes in health care consumption. Using a randomized-control trial design, Jaroszewicz et al. (2022) find no impact of payments to individuals in poverty on health expenditures. To our knowledge, we contribute the first estimates of a cash distribution on prescription use among individuals with employer-sponsored insurance. Two previous studies of prescription use have focused on targeted transfers to elderly and low income groups (Gross et al., 2022; Lyngse, 2020). In a population of Medicare Part D enrollees, Gross et al. (2022) find that on the day that Social Security checks are received, prescriptions increase 6% to 12% among beneficiaries subjected to the most cost sharing. However, dually eligible Medicare-Medicaid beneficiaries subject to no cost sharing do not increase prescriptions and the authors can rule out increases larger than 0.4%. Using data on Danish welfare recipients, Lyngse (2020) finds that the propensity to fill a prescription increases by 52% on transfer income paydays. In contrast, we can rule out relatively small effects of the PFD in the first two weeks after the distribution.====Our study highlights the fact that takeaways from means-tested programs that typically go to the most disadvantaged may not apply to the broader population. Many factors play a role in liquidity sensitivity. Ex ante, it is unclear whether responsiveness to liquidity would be higher or lower in the employer-insured population than in the populations studied in the emerging literature by Gross et al. (2022) and Lyngse (2020) given that our population is wealthier and younger, but how much lower and whetehr it matters at all is still an open question. Our results are similar to the no copay group in Gross et al. (2022), suggesting that both insurance and income may be important modifiers of the effect. Even within a particular cash transfer, significant heterogeneity in responses across groups with different characteristics are observed. The marginal propensity to consume from the PFD is U-shaped, with low-liquidity, low income households and and high liquidity, high income households consuming the largest fraction of the distribution (Kueng, 2018). Similarly, a recent paper by Bayer et al. (2023) shows that the stimulus checks during the COVID pandemic that were based on unemployment status had a much larger multiplier effect −1.5- than the ones that were unconditional −0.25making the conditional transfer's effect six times as large. This difference is driven partially by the differences in marginal propensity to consume by the two groups as the unemployed are much more liquidity constrained.====In addition to the differences in population characteristics between this paper and Gross et al. (2022) and Lyngse (2020) described above, the nature of the distribution (i.e., annual and not through a social welfare program) may impact how it is spent via mental accounting, in which consumers categorize income and expenses into different mental accounts in order to track their finances (Thaler, 1999). For example, Kooreman (2000) finds that the elasticity of children's clothing expenditures is more sensitive to changes in the designated childhood allowance than other income sources and Hastings and Shapiro (2018) find that the marginal propensity to consume food is much higher from Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits than from cash, even for households for whom SNAP benefits are economically equivalent to cash. Likewise, monthly transfers may elicit a different behavioral response than an annual distribution. In an experiment, Chambers and Spencer (2008) find that experiment participants elected to spend more of tax refunds delivered monthly than annually. In comparing spending responses to changes in payroll taxes withheld to lump-sum payments, Coronado et al. (2005) finds similar propensity to spend while Sahm et al. (2012) find more propensity to spend from a lump-sum payment. Notably, Sahm et al. (2012) show that a majority of households did not notice the change in withholding that they study, potentially blunting any effects the monthly income change would have on spending.====If consumers view funds received from the PFD differently than monthly government assistance, then the PFD is perhaps most comparable to a tax refund. Recent evidence on the relationship between tax refunds and health expenditures comes from Holmes et al., al.(2018), who uses transaction-level data from 1.2 million accounts receiving a tax refund.====After receipt of the refund, spending on health averages $30 per account, of which less than 1% ($0.30) goes towards goods that can be stockpiled such as medications. Our findings are in line with this result.====In addition to contributing to the literature of cash transfers on prescription use, we also add to the literature on the effects of the Alaska PFD, of which there is limited evidence of on health-related outcomes. Evans and Moore (2011) find that the Alaska PFD temporarily increases then decreases mortality. Using police report data, Watson et al. (2019) find increases in requested medical assists and substance abuse crime incidents. As the longest running universal cash transfer in the United States, the PFD is a useful natural experiment for learning about the potential effects of future cash transfer programs.====The paper proceeds as follows.

Moreover, auxiliary analyses from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) show that RML adoption is associated with a reduction in adult cigarette smoking. We conclude that RMLs may generate tobacco-related health benefits.","Public support for the legalization of recreational marijuana has increased substantially over the last decade and a half, rising from 25 percent in 1995 to 68 percent in 2020 (Gallup 2020). Between January 2012 and December 2022, 21 states and the District of Columbia have enacted recreational marijuana laws (RMLs), which legalize the possession, sale, and, in most cases, home cultivation of small quantities of marijuana (e.g., one or two ounces) for those ages 21 and older for any purpose, including recreational use. The first state to enact an RML was Washington on December 6, 2012, followed by Colorado four days later. Each state that has adopted an RML had previously adopted a medical marijuana law (MML) on average, 13 years prior. Unlike most MMLs, RMLs do not require registration as part of a state registry nor do they require a doctor's recommendation to treat an “allowable medical condition” (National Council of State Legislatures 2022). To legally obtain marijuana at an open recreational dispensary, individuals must simply show proof that they are age 21. In addition, nearly all states that legalize recreational marijuana permit home-growing of marijuana plants (Anderson et al., 2021).====While RMLs have garnered substantial support among policymakers and the public, the American Medical Association (AMA) and the American Public Health Association (APHA) have questioned their efficacy and withheld their support for recreational marijuana legalization (AMA 2021; APHA 2020). Public health experts warn that the legalization of recreational marijuana could normalize smoking among adults, leading to an increase in tobacco use (Ong 2016). One piece of evidence used to support this hypothesis is that co-use of marijuana and tobacco, often as “blunts,” has increased in recent years among U.S. adults (Goodwin et al., 2018; Schauer et al., 2015; Coley et al., 2021).====Opponents of RMLs argue that frequent and heavy marijuana smoking has been linked to lung disease (American Lung Association 2021) and a host of respiratory problems, including chronic cough, bronchial episodes, and increased phlegm productivity (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine 2017).==== Many of the adverse respiratory health effects of marijuana smoking are shared with tobacco smoking (Tashkin 2013). Nonsmokers’ rights organizations argue that secondhand marijuana smoke is as important to curb as secondhand tobacco smoke (American Nonsmokers’ Rights Foundation 2021). In addition, there is evidence that frequent marijuana use (especially at younger ages) is linked to increased risk of depression (Buckner et al., 2010; Dumas et al., 2002), psychiatric problems (Guttmannova et al., 2017; Keith et al., 2015; Zvolensky et al., 2006, Zvolensky et al., 2008), and impaired cognitive function (Jager and Ramsey 2008). There is also evidence that when combined with pharmaceutical drugs or alcohol, marijuana use may generate important health risks to users (Ashton 2018; Sokolovsky et al., 2020).====However, adverse health effects of marijuana use are, in part, mitigated by smoke-avoidant methods of marijuana consumption (i.e., baked goods, edibles, beverages). Moreover, relative to tobacco use, far fewer studies have linked marijuana consumption to cancers, heart disease, or stroke (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 2017). To the contrary, moderate marijuana use is associated with some important health ====, including reduced risks of mortality and mobility, and alleviating pain, anxiety, and many side effects of cancer and HIV treatments (Hall et al., 2005; Fiz et al., 2011; Ware et al., 2010; Anderson et al., 2014; Sabia et al., 2017; Choi et al., 2019; Anderson and Rees Forthcoming).====In contrast, tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States (U.S.) and has been linked to nearly one-half million deaths per year (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2021a). In addition, its consumption leads to increased risk of emphysema, cancers of the colon, liver, head, and lung, and stroke (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2020). If marijuana and tobacco are complements for adults, the direct medical costs — including “internality” costs resulting from non-rational addiction (Gruber and Köszegi 2001) — and health-related externality costs of RMLs could be substantial.====Recent research shows that the legalization of marijuana for medicinal purposes is associated with a small reduction in tobacco cigarette use, suggesting that medical marijuana and tobacco are substitutes for adults (Choi et al., 2019). However, the effects of RMLs could differ from MMLs for a number of reasons. First, to the extent that a non-trivial share of those who were induced to consume marijuana from MMLs were treating allowable medical conditions (i.e., pain, fibromyalgia, nausea, and side effects of cancers and HIV treatment), the marginal individual induced to consume marijuana from an RML may differ substantially on characteristics related to health production (i.e., age, health stock, depreciation rate). In this circumstance, the local average treatment effect (LATE) of RMLs on adult tobacco use may differ as well.====Second, the market for tobacco products changed dramatically from the mid-1990s, when the first MML was enacted (California in 1996). For instance, approximately one-quarter of the U.S. population lived in states with an MML before electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) were introduced to the U.S. market in 2006–2007 (Office of the Surgeon General 2016). While initial e-cigarette sales occurred largely via internet sales, it was during the 2009–2012 period that retail sales of e-cigarettes widely expanded (Huang et al., 2021). Moreover, the introduction of JUUL (Juice USB Lighting) in June 2015 — accompanied by a wide assortment of flavors — also greatly expanded the set of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) products (Truth Initiative 2019).====The wide availability of e-cigarette products at the time of RML-adoption may result in a very different tobacco use response. For example, vaping pens and JUUL devices used for e-cigarette consumption may be adapted to permit marijuana smoking (Miech et al., 2020), which could result in a complementary relationship between e-cigarettes and marijuana. On the other hand, if e-cigarettes and marijuana both serve to produce euphoria (“high”), generate utility from a smoking experience, or serve the ends of quitting cigarette smoking, then marijuana and e-cigarettes may be substitutes.====Third, the tobacco policy environment continued to evolve during the period when RMLs were adopted. Between 2012 and mid-2019, state excise taxes on cigarettes increased 36 times with an average increase of $0.473 per pack, with 37 states attaining excise taxes of over $1 per pack (Orzechowski and Walker, 2021). In addition, over this same period, 10 states and two large counties enacted taxes on ENDS (Abouk et al., 2023), clean indoor air laws were expanded in eight states (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2021b), and 16 states and the District of Columbia enacted a minimum legal purchasing age of 21 for all tobacco products (Hansen et al., 2020).==== These tobacco control policies increase the shadow price of tobacco at the same time RMLs were enacted, which could dampen a complementary relationship and potentially reinforce a substitutional relationship between recreational marijuana and tobacco. Alternatively, those who continue to consume tobacco following the enactment of a wide set of tobacco control policies (i.e., taxes, informational campaigns, clean indoor air laws, minimum legal purchasing ages) may have a relatively more inelastic demand for tobacco than prior smokers who were impacted by an MML. In this case, we might expect adult tobacco consumption to be relatively unaffected by the enactment of RMLs.====Finally, in part due to the success of past tobacco control efforts, a substantial share (55.1 percent) of current smokers expresses a desire to quit cigarette consumption (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2021c). This may reflect time-inconsistent preferences, social pressure to respond in this manner, or a desire for the costs of rational addiction to be lower. If the former reason dominates, the availability of a new consumer product, recreational marijuana, may aid these individuals in cessation efforts.====This study is the first to comprehensively examine the impact of the legalization of recreational marijuana on adult tobacco use. In so doing, we make several important contributions. First, we make use of a newly available nationally representative panel dataset, the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH). These longitudinal data permit the estimation of (1) dynamic difference-in-differences estimates (event-study analysis), and (2) discrete-time hazard models that partial out individual (time-invariant) unmeasured heterogeneity and model dynamic transitions across consumption margins for both marijuana and tobacco. In addition, we draw auxiliary data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) and employ difference-in-differences models using novel estimators developed by Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021) to expunge bias in two-way fixed effects (TWFE) models caused by heterogeneous and dynamic effects of RMLs on marijuana and tobacco use.====We document three key findings. First, “first-stage” results from the NSDUH and PATH show consistent evidence that RML adoption increases adult marijuana use by 2- to 5-percentage-points, including through vaping. Discrete-time hazard fixed effects estimates suggest that this increase in consumption is driven by an RML-induced increase in initiation of marijuana use among prior non-users. Event-study analyses, including those obtained using Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021) estimates, produce findings consistent with parallel pre-treatment trend. Second, we find no evidence that legalization of recreational marijuana increases adult tobacco use. The preponderance of the evidence suggests that RML adoption is associated with a small, lagged decline in tobacco use. NSDUH-based estimates suggests that two or more years after the adoption of an RML, legalization is associated with an approximately 0.5 to 2 percentage-point decline in tobacco use, including from cigarette consumption. Individual fixed effects estimates from the PATH show that RMLs are associated with a significant 1-to-2 percentage-point lagged decline in ENDS use. Third, we find that RML adoption accompanied by the opening of recreational marijuana dispensaries is associated with larger increases in ENDS use than RML adoption without open dispensaries. We conclude that the availability of recreational dispensaries is an important supply channel to explain substitution between marijuana and tobacco among adults.",Have recreational marijuana laws undermined public health progress on adult tobacco use?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629623000334,5 April 2023,2023,Research Article,10.0

Fifty-four million Medicaid beneficiaries in managed care plans, for instance, select a health plan from a set of choices offered by private insurers (Hinton et al., 2020). Premiums for these plans are paid by the government and are typically set at zero dollars for the enrollee. Medicare Advantage enrollees also select subsidized private health plans, and they often have several zero-premium plan options (Douven et al., 2020). The Health Insurance Marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) work similarly, though zero-dollar premium plans are less common (Branham and DeLeire, 2019). Despite the similarities between Medicaid managed care and the Marketplaces, take-up of subsidized Marketplace coverage is at least 36 percentage points lower than Medicaid take-up (McDermott et al., 2021, Decker et al., 2022, Bhanja et al., 2021). Can coverage take-up be improved by fully subsidizing premiums?====In this paper, we show that setting premiums to zero, rather than at a low but slightly positive level, increases coverage duration but not enrollment. Our analysis, based on a regression discontinuity design and 2016–2019 administrative data from Colorado’s Marketplace, exploits discontinuities in the availability of zero-premium plans. Our primary finding is that people who are just eligible to sign up for a zero-premium plan end up being covered for 2.3 to 4.8 days more than people who are just ineligible. Scaling this estimate by the take-up rate of zero-premium plans, we find that enrolling in a zero-premium plan increases coverage by 29–47 days. This extra duration is driven by lower-income enrollees and comes from both reduced drop-out and, especially, increased early coverage start dates. The main mechanism responsible for the increased duration in zero-premium plans is that enrollees in positive-premium plans must make a small initial payment after signing up for coverage. The required payment creates a transaction cost which zero-premium plans eliminate. Overall, our results suggest that transaction costs can be a meaningful barrier to coverage and benefit take-up, especially for lower-income households.====Our context is the Health Insurance Marketplaces, which have had zero-premium plans since their implementation in 2014. For eligible households, premiums in the Marketplaces are subsidized by premium tax credits (PTC). Premium tax credit generosity varies across households and is set so that the net premium an eligible household pays for a “benchmark” plan is equal to a sliding-scale percentage of its income. If a household’s PTC exceeds the premium of the lowest-premium plan available to them, then the household is able to purchase a zero-premium plan (Branham and DeLeire, 2019, Drake and Anderson, 2020).==== Zero-premium plan availability has expanded greatly since 2014. With the passage of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, roughly 12 million Americans had the option to purchase a zero-premium Marketplace plan in 2021 (Rae et al., 2021, Branham et al., 2021).====Most enrollees do not select a health plan until or shortly before December 15th, the deadline for January 1st coverage. Applicants that selected plans with non-zero premiums must then make an initial premium payment by December 31st to begin coverage on January 1st. For the 36 states that used the federal ==== Marketplace from 2017 through 2021, failure to make this initial payment by December 31st meant that applicants were ineligible to purchase subsidized coverage until the following year (Anderson et al., 2019). The Biden Administration reversed this policy for 2022 coverage in ==== states, allowing applicants a “second chance” to obtain February 1st coverage by signing up by January 15th and making an initial premium payment by January 31st. Colorado, which does not use ====, has maintained at least a January 15th enrollment deadline since 2014.====The transaction costs of making the initial premium payment can be minimal for relatively higher-income applicants, who simply can make a credit card payment at the time of enrollment. This is not the case, however, for many lower-income eligible applicants, who often lack access to credit cards and are unbanked (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 2020).==== These applicants must write a check or obtain a money order, mail it, and confirm that the insurer receives it over the last two weeks of the year. This process must be completed during a two-week period that is often highly financially stressful for low-income Americans (Swartz and Graves, 2014). That we only find coverage duration and not enrollment effects likely reflects Colorado’s policy of allowing applicants a second chance to enroll in January (i.e., Colorado provides applicants two chances to address these financial transaction costs).====Our analysis uses regression discontinuity (RD) designs and 2016–2019 administrative data from Colorado. The data include plan selections, plan availability, and, crucially, PTCs awarded for all enrollees. Our RD models leverage discontinuities in the availability of zero-premium plans to identify how zero-premium plan availability affects coverage choices. Our running variable is the premium of the lowest-premium plan available to an enrollee, less their awarded PTC. As a function of the running variable, post-subsidy premiums are continuous but kinked. However, when the running variable becomes negative, zero-premium plans become available, which is our key discontinuity. The running variable is a complex function of household income, size, and premiums available; it does not appear to be manipulated.====We investigate the effects of zero-premium plan availability and enrollment on Marketplace enrollment rates, plan choice, and coverage duration. Our primary finding is that enrollment durations are 2.3 to 4.8 days higher among enrollees just eligible for zero-premium plans. Scaling this estimate by the discontinuity in take-up of these plans, about eight percent, implies that enrollment in a zero-premium plan increases coverage by 29–47 days. This increased duration is driven entirely by enrollees with household incomes below 200% of the federal poverty level (FPL). Most of this duration effect comes from earlier start dates – enrollees are more likely to begin coverage on January 1st – although a sizable minority of the effect comes from reduced drop-out. We do not find economically significant responses on margins beyond duration. Enrollment in Marketplace coverage and generosity of selected plans are not responsive to zero-premium plan availability.====We argue that our results are most consistent with a financial transaction costs-based mechanism, and that these transaction costs create a welfare loss for a segment of the population. In particular, financial transaction costs explain our finding that zero-premium plans increase coverage through on-time starts and sign-ups. This finding is difficult to rationalize with other mechanisms. Psychological mechanisms appear to be less important in our context since they would imply plan choice effects, which we do not observe. Liquidity constraints are unlikely because our regression discontinuity design estimates the effect of zero-premium relative to $1 or lower. These transaction costs likely have substantial consequences for a share of enrollees. For the compliers – the eight percent of people who select a zero-premium plan when it is available – the presence of financial transaction costs reduce coverage by slightly over one month, causing them to lose several hundred dollars of health insurance subsidies which are obtainable at a premium of $1 or less.====Our results have several broader implications beyond Colorado’s Health Insurance Marketplace. Our finding of no effect of zero-premium plans on overall Marketplace enrollment is arguably surprising, and likely driven by the fact that Colorado’s open enrollment period extends into January. Enrollees that miss the December 31st payment deadline have another month to sign up for coverage. Policies that facilitate late enrollment may mitigate transactions costs. In most states, during the study period, however, enrollees who miss the payment deadline cannot sign up for subsidized coverage until the following year. Thus, zero-premium plans may increase enrollment as well as duration in other states, though we acknowledge that there are other institutional differences across states that make extrapolation difficult. More broadly, policies that ease transaction costs may be helpful in increasing take-up and reducing uninsurance, both of which directly improve health outcomes for middle-aged and lower-income populations (Goldin et al., 2021, Miller et al., 2021). Policies to reduce Marketplace transaction costs include longer open enrollment periods, grace periods for initial premium payments, and subsidies to reduce low premiums to zero.====Our findings contribute to two bodies of literature. Primarily, we contribute to literature examining the causes of low take-up of social insurance programs. A common explanation for this low take-up is that enrollment in social insurance programs often requires overcoming “ordeals”. Examples of ordeals include long wait times, extensive paperwork, application complexity, and opaque eligibility rules. Economists have long recognized that such ordeals likely reduce take-up (e.g., Currie, 2006). Since at least the work of Nichols and Zeckhauser (1982), however, economists have also recognized that ordeals can increase program efficiency by better targeting funds, because they can differentially screen out relatively less needy applicants, such as high-income applicants. Recent work has investigated the screening properties of these ordeals, finding that hassle costs are an important reason that benefits are left on the table, but with mixed results regarding whether ordeals increase or decrease targeting efficiency (Deshpande and Li, 2019, Finkelstein and Notowidigdo, 2019, Goldin et al., 2021, Homonoff and Somerville, 2020). Especially relevant is recent work by Domurat et al. (2021) who conduct a field experiment in California’s Health Insurance Marketplace, providing information about deadlines and benefit eligibility. Consistent with our transaction cost mechanism, they find that providing information about sign-up deadlines increases coverage. However, they do not examine the transaction costs of making a premium payment. Our primary contribution to this literature, which has largely focused on government-supplied benefits, is to show that market provision of subsidized benefits can also produce an ordeal in the form of transaction costs. In our study context, this ordeal differentially screens out low-income beneficiaries, likely reducing targeting efficiency. The transaction cost that we document may also help explain the apparent low willingness-to-pay (and subsequent low take-up) for subsidized insurance coverage documented by Finkelstein et al. (2019).====Our findings also contribute to literature focusing on zero-price effects in health care and health insurance. Ching et al. (2022) and Iizuka and Shigeoka (2021) show that demand for health care appears to be discontinuous at a price of zero, pointing to a zero-price effect. In the health insurance context, Douven et al. (2020), Newhouse and McGuire (2014), and Stockley et al. (2014) argue that observed premium patterns are consistent with a zero-price effect, because many plans offer a premium of exactly zero, and survey respondents indicate a zero-premium preference in discrete choice experiments. They do not study actual insurance choices, however. Using aggregate data, Drake and Anderson (2020) find an association between zero-premium plan availability and Marketplace enrollment in the states using the ==== platform. However, their ability to identify precise zeros is limited by their use of aggregate data, and they do not examine other outcomes such as coverage duration or plan choice. Dague (2014) finds that when Wisconsin’s Medicaid program introduces a $10 premium, enrollees were much more likely to drop out. McIntyre et al. (2021) find that a policy in Massachusetts of automatically switching enrollees to zero-premium plans (when available) if they default on their premiums substantially reduces drop-out.====We make two contributions relative to this literature. First, we investigate zero-premium effects on enrollment, coverage duration, and plan choice, which the previous literature has not investigated. Our findings show that a large share of zero-premium plans’ overall effect comes from earlier start dates, not only reduced drop-out. Second, we show that transaction costs, rather than a literal psychological bias towards zero, likely explain the zero-price effects we document. This distinction is important for policymakers and price setters because transaction costs can be eliminated with alternative payment rules. We show, at least in our context, that transaction costs account for zero-price effects.",Financial transaction costs reduce benefit take-up evidence from zero-premium health insurance plans in Colorado,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629623000292,23 March 2023,2023,Research Article,11.0

Problems of stigma and discrimination can lead to poor physical and mental health outcomes, and gender minority stress and gender dysphoria lie at the root of these inequities (Meyer, 2003; Turban et al., 2022). A major problem is the lack of family acceptance and support, which directly contributes to stress and dysphoria and also acts as a block against access to insurance and health care. In fact, Kundu et al. (2022) find that being insulted by one's parents or an adult during childhood ranks among the top three correlates of suicidal thoughts in the past year among a sample of sexual and gender minority young adults in Canada. Hostile parents, in turn, often encourage or coerce their transgender children into undergoing sexual orientation or gender identity change efforts, often referred to as “conversion therapy” or “conversion practices.”==== These efforts, usually led by counselors or religious advisors, aim to change an individual's sexual orientation or to discourage individuals, especially adolescents, from identifying as transgender or from expressing themselves in gender-diverse ways.====Most professional associations related to mental health and the health of young people have critiqued conversion therapy as being ineffective at best and harmful at worst, and 20 states have banned the practice (Mallory et al., 2019; MAP, 2022). However, there is very little quantitative evidence on the effects of conversion therapy on measures of mental health and wellbeing among trans and gender-diverse youth. Although quite a few studies across disciplines have been published on conversion therapy (e.g. James et al., 2016; Turban et al., 2020; Higbee et al., 2022), to our knowledge, none of them address important sources of selection into conversion therapy as explained below.====Our goal is to fill this gap by using data from the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey (USTS) to examine the relationship between conversion therapy and the risk of attempting suicide and running away for transgender adolescents. Since unobservable characteristics such as socioeconomic status and upbringing may affect both conversion therapy exposure and measures of wellbeing, simple correlations that do not account for differences in characteristics between the treated and control groups prior to conversion therapy exposure may be misleading, and they cannot prove that young people who are subjected to conversion therapy are at a greater risk of poor wellbeing because of the therapy. For example, trans youth exposed to conversion therapy may have had other disadvantages (such as living in a hostile community or having lower socioeconomic status) that could explain both the conversion therapy participation and the poor wellbeing, or they may have had poor wellbeing that led their parents to consider conversion therapy. To identify the effect of conversion therapy on measures of wellbeing, we utilize a difference-in-differences (DID) approach. This approach allows us to estimate a substantive treatment effect of conversion therapy on the risk of attempting suicide and running away for transgender adolescents.====By comparing transgender adolescents who are exposed to conversion therapy (treated group) with those who are either never exposed or are exposed later on (control group), we find that conversion therapy increases the risk of attempting suicide by 17 percentage points, which amounts to a 55% increase in the risk of attempting suicide, and running away by 7.8 percentage points, more than doubling the risk of running away. The effects are largest when exposure to conversion therapy occurs at a young age (11–14). These estimates are compelling not only because they pass a battery of falsification and robustness tests, but also because the rate of attempting suicide and running away is remarkably similar in both level and trend between the treated and control groups over the five years preceding conversion therapy. Furthermore and most importantly, the estimates hold when we exploit only the precise timing of conversion therapy, limiting the control group to those who are exposed to conversion therapy one year after the treated group.====Our paper contributes to the literature on transgender well-being. Numerous studies have shown that transgender individuals are more likely to report poor general, physical, and mental health compared to their cisgender counterparts (Meyer et al., 2017; Cicero et al., 2020; Campbell and Rodgers, 2022). Mental health disparities are particularly stark, with considerably higher rates of depression, anxiety, PTSD, suicidality, and substance abuse in the U.S. transgender community (Haas et al., 2014; Marshall et al., 2016; Reisner et al., 2016; Downing, 2018; Lagos, 2018). Data from the USTS indicate that 40% of respondents had attempted suicide at least once in their lifetime, a rate that exceeds that of the general population by a factor of close to nine (James et al., 2016). Moreover, in a 2017 survey of U.S. high school students, 34.6% of the transgender students had attempted suicide compared to 5.5% of cisgender male students and 9.1% of cisgender female students (Johns et al., 2019). These kinds of mental health disparities also have repercussions for the labor market, with losses in human capital and labor productivity (e.g. Lerner and Henke 2008; Chatterji et al., 2011; Rivera et al., 2017; Dow et al., 2020).====For both indicators we examine, risk factors include depression, lack of family and community support, and victimization (Thompson, 2006). Although the magnitude of welfare losses seems at least an order of magnitude larger for suicide attempts compared to running away, we argue that running away is an important indicator of wellbeing because this action increases the subsequent risk of drug addiction, homelessness, sexual risk taking, dropping out of school, criminal activity, and additional depressive symptoms (Kaufman and Widom, 1999; Tucker et al., 2011; Rice et al., 2013; Aratani and Cooper 2015).====This study also offers timely evidence to inform the discussion of public policies relating to transgender health. Although a number of states have institutionalized bias against transgender individual (with, for example, provisions that exclude gender-affirming care from Medicaid coverage), several states have introduced such gender affirming policies as conversion therapy bans as well as gender marker laws that allow people to change their gender on official documents such as birth certificates and drivers licenses (Mann, 2021). These policy changes have placed transgender issues in the national spotlight and increased the need for empirical evidence on their possible welfare effects. However, relatively little is known about the effect of either affirming or exclusionary laws, given a relative dearth of data that allow the identification of transgender individuals. By using the U.S. Transgender Survey – the largest survey of transgender individuals of its kind – and recently-developed estimation techniques, this study aims to contribute new evidence on welfare outcomes associated with conversion therapy that should help to inform these policy discussions.","Conversion therapy, suicidality, and running away: An analysis of transgender youth in the U.S.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629623000279,17 March 2023,2023,Research Article,12.0

To disentangle changes in practice styles attributable to hospital- and peer group-specific factors, we exploit quasi-random variation on cardiologists working together on the same days. We find that migrating cardiologists’ ","Individual behavior is to a large extent shaped through interactions with the environment. The social environment in particular – including peer networks, classmates and workplace colleagues – has been widely studied by labor economists to understand and quantify important drivers of productivity (see, e.g., Sacerdote, 2001, Falk and Ichino, 2006, Mas and Moretti, 2009). In healthcare, a growing literature in health economics has sought to understand causes of variations in physician practice styles and their consequences for care quality, healthcare utilization and overall health system efficiency (see, e.g., Grytten and Sørensen, 2003, Epstein and Nicholson, 2009, Currie et al., 2016, Epstein et al., 2016, Van Parys, 2016, Molitor, 2018, Cutler et al., 2019, Currie and MacLeod, 2020, Fadlon and Van Parys, 2020, Weng et al., 2020).==== However, despite calls for effective policies that seek to reduce inappropriate variations in healthcare utilization (see, e.g., OECD, 2014, Brownlee et al., 2017), the scientific evidence on the impact of healthcare practitioners’ social environment on clinical practice behavior and patient outcomes has so far been scant.====This paper seeks to add to the literature on the determinants of provider practice styles by studying how physicians’ treatment choices are influenced by their practice environment and the consequences these choices have for their patients. To this end, we make two major contributions that so far have been largely overlooked in the literature. First, we propose a method to decompose the environmental effect into a physical and a social component, corresponding to a hospital-specific and a peer group-specific component. As we argue further below, this is an important distinction to make since the two components provide very different implications for policy. Second, by relating data on physicians’ treatment choices to optimal management and associated patient outcomes, we are able to gauge and directly measure the impact of environmentally induced variation in physician treatment behavior on changes in the appropriateness, treatment costs, and the quality of care received by patients. This is in contrast to most existing studies on physician practice styles, which often rely solely on quantitative measures to evaluate practice heterogeneity.====To provide an empirical framework for identification and consistent estimation of causal effects, we apply and extend the physician migration approach used by Molitor (2018) in the important context of hospital treatment of patients suffering from coronary heart disease. Specifically, we focus on stent choice in coronary angioplasty — a medical procedure used to widen blocked or narrowed blood vessels in the heart.==== We identify physicians who move (migrate) across hospitals and relate the variation in the rate of use of a specific stent type between the physician’s pre-move (origin) and post-move (destination) hospitals to changes in the physician’s own stent use across time in a difference-in-differences model.====To estimate the model, we use rich administrative data from the Swedish Coronary Angiography and Angioplasty Register (SCAAR) on all percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) performed in Sweden between 2004 and 2013 and study how interventional cardiologists’ choices between the bare metal stent (BMS) and the drug-eluting stent (DES) are determined by their environment.==== Since the procedure, PCI, is identically performed irrespective of the stent type used, this context provides an essentially ideal setting to study how the practice environment shapes physician preferences for treatment.====While empirical evidence on the extent to which physician practice styles are influenced by their work environment is informative, it does not per se convey much detail on ==== environmental factors are the drivers of such changes. Yet, such knowledge could be important. For example, physical, or hospital-specific, factors may be less informative about the malleability of physicians’ underlying preferences if the possibility to operate in line with such preferences is restricted by factors beyond the individual physician’s control, such as resource constraints, staff micromanagement, or hospital-specific guidelines. In contrast, social, or peer group-specific, factors are more directly related to the adjustment of physician beliefs for which much of the economic literature on physician practice styles lies at the heart of (see, e.g., Epstein and Nicholson, 2009).====To address this important question, we propose and implement a method to decompose the combined impact of the environment on physician treatment styles into a hospital-specific and a peer group-specific factor by exploiting quasi-random variation on physicians working together on given days. Specifically, given sufficient practice style variation among migrating physicians’ coworkers (peers) ==== a hospital, the inclusion of hospital fixed effects in our econometric model will effectively purge all time-invariant hospital-specific variation in practice styles ==== hospitals from the analysis. Any remaining practice variation will consequently be derived from changes in the migrating physicians’ coworker mix. Thus, resulting estimates of the environmental effect with and without hospital fixed effects gauge the relative magnitude of the adjustment in physician practice style arising from hospital- and peer group-specific factors, respectively.====Our estimation results show that cardiologists’ DES use in angioplasty treatments are strongly determined by the practice style of the hospital they currently work in. Migrating cardiologists rapidly adapt to their prevailing practice environment after relocation by changing their DES use with on average half a percentage point for each percentage point difference in DES utilization rates between the origin and destination hospitals. This result is robust to a set of alternative specifications and close to the corresponding estimate found by Molitor (2018). Furthermore, when decomposing the overall effect into a hospital-specific and a peer group-specific effect, we find that each component is responsible for roughly half of the practice style adjustment. To assess the extent of heterogeneity in response across cardiologists, we also provide results from a series of split sample regressions which reveal that our results are mainly derived from younger cardiologists and cardiologists moving to more DES-intensive environments.====In contrast, we find no empirical evidence to support the hypothesis that environmentally induced changes in migrating physicians’ practice styles had important consequences for the care quality received by patients. In addition to analyzing a set of adverse clinical events related to the medical procedure, we employ a machine learning algorithm to classify appropriate stent choices for each case based on out-of-sample predictions from non-migrating cardiologists and a rich set of patient and clinical characteristics. While our analysis does not reveal important systematic impacts on patient health as a result of changes in their physician’s practice environment, we do find that migrating physicians are more likely to inappropriately apply DES after their move. This result suggests that the environmentally induced changes in physicians’ practice behavior are mainly based on marginal “gray-zone” cases who run little risk of serious adverse medical events as a consequence of such choices. Moreover, a back-of-the-envelope calculation of the potential monetary savings from following the most efficient treatment approach suggests that the average migrating cardiologist incurred an additional cost of USD 1,500 per year from inappropriate stent choices, corresponding to roughly one-quarter of the price of a PCI.====One potential concern with our decomposition approach is that migrating physicians are non-randomly matched with peers after they move. This would introduce bias in our estimated parameters if migrants exert some control over whom they are working with and use this control to select coworkers with matching preferences. While this is unlikely to occur in practice, and would lead our estimates to be a lower bound of the true effect if it did, we nevertheless evaluate the robustness of our results to such endogeneity concerns by replacing our measure of practice environment with a ==== environment. Based on the synthetic control method (see, e.g., Abadie and Gardeazabal, 2003, Abadie et al., 2010, Abadie et al., 2015), we construct an artificial matched comparison group using the sample of non-migrating cardiologists in our data. This method safeguards against estimation bias by comparing practice styles of migrating cardiologists with non-migrating cardiologists who were exposed to similar peer practice environments prior to the relocation. Reassuringly, we find that our estimates are largely robust to the definition of practice environment. In addition, we also estimate placebo models where we replace our main outcome with indicators for patient case-mix to study whether our peer effects are driven by patient, as opposed to stent, selection. The results from this analysis show – in line with the knowledge transfer hypothesis – that the type of patients that cardiologists are treating is unrelated to their peers’ practice styles.====Our findings contribute to the scant literature on peer effects and social learning in healthcare. Social learning is broadly defined as the process of information transmission between economic agents when they observe and interact with each other within their social networks (see, e.g., Lin et al., 1981). In line with our results, Huesch (2011) finds evidence for intra-group spillovers in DES use, suggesting that physicians are influenced by their peers. Furthermore, Nair et al. (2010) study peer effects in physicians’ prescribing choices and find that such behavior is particularly influenced by research-active peers within physician groups. Heijmans et al. (2017) find similar results studying peer effects in cardiovascular risk management in networks with and without opinion leaders. On the other hand, Yang et al. (2014) document only small peer effects in prescription behavior for new drugs among physicians working in the same hospital at the same time. Silver (2021) studies the effect of working in a high-pressure peer group environment in an emergency department on physicians’ treatment behavior and patient outcomes and finds that physicians alter their treatment styles in response to their peer group, affecting care quality. Moreover, Epstein and Nicholson (2009) find that physicians’ treatment styles are responsive to changes in treatment styles of other physicians in the same hospital region in the context of Cesarean sections, but the effect dampens when accounting for common shocks at the hospital level. This is in line with our finding that both hospitals and peers are influential in altering physicians’ practice styles. Finally, Burke et al. (2003) find that patients are more likely to receive certain procedures if an attending physician is in a group that performs these procedures more frequently; and Yuan et al. (2020) show that shared beliefs are crucial for successful implementation of new health technology within a peer network. Complementing these findings, the results from our split sample analyses show that the effects are driven by younger cardiologists and cardiologists moving to more DES-intensive environments.====We also add contextual depth to the more general economic literature on peer effects.==== Several papers have investigated the influence of peers on academic performance, yielding mixed results. While some authors find significant peer effects (Sacerdote, 2001, Zimmerman, 2003), others find no effects at all (Foster, 2006, Lyle, 2007), or effects only for particular subgroups (Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner, 2006). In contrast, there exists strong evidence for positive social spillovers on task-oriented work behavior and productivity in non-academic settings. Mas and Moretti (2009) study peer effects at the workplace by analyzing the productivity of coworkers within the same team. They find evidence of positive productivity spillovers when working with highly productive peers, especially when they interact more frequently. Moreover, in an experimental setting, Falk and Ichino (2006) study individuals working on separate tasks within the sight of one another, finding that the productivity of workers is influenced by the productivity of their peers. These results motivate our approach to use physicians working on the same days as relevant peers in the analysis. Finally, Bandiera et al. (2010) study whether workers’ behaviors are affected by the presence of peers that they are socially tied to, finding that a worker’s productivity is positively correlated with friends’ abilities.====Furthermore, we contribute to the emerging health economics’ literature on physician practice styles. Previous research on this topic has documented mixed results. Grytten and Sørensen (2003) find that primary care physicians’ practice styles are largely stable, while for specialists Molitor (2018) and Weng et al. (2020) show that practice styles are malleable to their environment. Variation in physicians’ treatment styles may also have a lasting influence on patient care (see, e.g., Currie et al., 2016, Kwok, 2019, Fadlon and Van Parys, 2020). We complement these findings by providing empirical evidence that physicians equally strongly react to their social as well as their physical environments and relating how these altered practice styles affect care quality.====Lastly, our results have broad implications for healthcare system efficiency. The finding that physicians’ decisions are influenced by their social environment suggests a rationale for why practice styles cluster in certain areas. While such clustering may generate positive productivity and learning spillovers as in Chandra and Staiger (2007), it also implies that patients may receive suboptimal care depending on the dominating practice style at the admitting healthcare provider. In particular, in supply-sensitive areas of healthcare, where the frequency of use of an activity is related to its local capacity, and where the choice of healthcare provider is subject to restrictions, such as place of residence, substantial allocation inefficiencies may exist. If quality of care is largely insensitive to such variations, as this paper shows in the context of cardiac catheterizations, a more integrated system where inappropriate practice variation can be mitigated through enhanced care coordination, monitoring, and follow-up based on evidence-based clinical guidelines could be vastly resource-saving (Wennberg, 2010). However, broadly defined uniform guidelines may not be the most efficient way to reduce inappropriate healthcare variations when patient populations are clinically diverse. For example, Chan et al. (2022) show that diagnosing pneumonia varies substantially across physicians with different skill levels where less skilled physicians are more likely to choose lower thresholds to reduce the risk of failing to correctly diagnose a patient.==== Similarly, we find that younger and less experienced migrating physicians are more likely to inappropriately apply DES after their move. These findings suggest that investments in training of less experienced physicians to increase their skills may be a cost-efficient alternative to national guidelines to reduce unwarranted resource use.","Providers, peers and patients.

This suggests that mask mandates can help counter pandemics, particularly if widely accepted.","Governments around the world implemented a range of policy measures to counter the rapid spread of COVID-19. Mandating the use of face masks was one such measure. Widespread mask wearing allows for continued human interaction and economic activity, unlike strict lockdown measures such as stay-at-home orders. However, mask mandates remain controversial in many countries. Evidence on the effect of mask mandates is important to inform decisions on their potential future deployment — both in the United States and abroad.==== and potentially also indirectly, by inducing behavioral changes.====Importantly, this paper does not estimate the effect of wearing masks, but rather the effect of mandating mask wearing. For mask mandates to succeed in saving lives, they would need to reduce the transmission of COVID-19. This would put a dent on the number of COVID-19 cases, ==== admissions, and ultimately deaths. We estimate the effect of statewide mask mandates on these variables across counties in the United States in 2020.====, that is a state border that separates two counties, in which one county is in a state with a mask mandate at a given time and the other county is in a state without a mask mandate at the same time. Variation in COVID-19 outcomes across these mask borders is much more likely to be driven by the existence of mask mandates and less by different local stages of the pandemic. This identification strategy allows estimating the effect of statewide mask mandates.====In this paper, we study the effect of mask mandates at the state- rather than county-level. This choice is motivated on both conceptual and methodological grounds. First, statewide mandates were a far more common policy tool during the pandemic – in 2020, close to 94 percent of county-week pairs that were subject to mask mandates had a statewide order.====We find a significant and substantial effect of statewide mask mandates. Specifically, mask mandates on average reduced new weekly COVID-19 cases, hospital admissions, and deaths by 55, 11, and 0.7 per 100,000 inhabitants. Given existing evidence that attitudes towards mask wearing vary with political leaning (====), we also estimate the effects of mask mandates across political leaning as measured by the vote shares in the 2020 Presidential Election—a variable that is readily available at the county level. Political leaning should be seen as a proxy for deeper-held attitudes. We find that estimated effects vary strongly with political leaning: the effect on cases and deaths is larger in Democratic-leaning counties and smaller in Republican-leaning counties. This is likely because mandates in more Democratic-leaning counties are more effective in promoting mask wearing. These conditional effects are important enough that they must be taken into account. Indeed, the estimated effect of mask mandates on weekly deaths per 100,000 inhabitants varies from around −2.5 to 0 depending on the political leaning of counties, compared to the average effect of −0.7 mentioned above.====Our results imply that statewide mask mandates saved 87,000 lives through December 19, 2020, while an additional 57,000 lives could have been saved in the same period if a nationwide mandate had been enacted starting in April 2020. Both numbers are chiefly driven by the estimated effects of mask mandates in urban Democratic-leaning counties. Lives saved by mask mandates are concentrated in urban Democratic-leaning counties in states that imposed mandates, while lives that could have been saved are concentrated in urban Democratic-leaning counties in states without mask mandates. The magnitude of these effects is large. For comparison, COVID-19 deaths in the same period amounted to around 309,000 in the United States.====.====Our results hold important lessons for all countries aiming to counter the spread of COVID-19 and other pandemics in the years to come. First, not all countries are rolling out vaccines at the same pace, and many will struggle to reach large swaths of their population in the medium-term. Second, existing vaccines may not be as effective against either known or future variants, and there may well be future outbreaks of other airborne pandemics. At the same time, our results highlight the limitations of mask mandates and their dependence on individual’s attitudes. Mask mandates do not reduce the spread of a pandemic if they fail to engender greater mask usage and/or behavioral changes, such as incentivizing ====. Thus, mask mandates are likely to remain a highly relevant policy tool in the years to come, particularly if coupled with other complementary policies that educate, persuade, and incentivize the population to comply.====Our contribution to the existing literature is both conceptual and methodological.

Two organizational settings are compared, a team in which physicians cooperate and solo practices in which they do not. Team care is strictly superior to solo practice care if the difference in expected ","Chronic diseases are a costly burden on health care systems. In the US, for example, 60% of the population suffer from at least one chronic disease. Further, chronically ill patients account for 90% of health care expenditures (Buttorff, 2017). According to Bodenheimer et al. (2009), one barrier to the efficient provision of chronic care is that health care systems are built around the treatment of acute problems rather than the long-term health of the patient. One of the measures they propose to improve chronic care is to provide it in teams rather than solo practices. In a meta analysis, Pascucci et al. (2020) find that inter-professional collaboration improves a number of health related outcomes for chronically ill patients indeed. Lemieux-Charles and McGuire (2006) analyze studies relating to the effectiveness of health care teams compared to usual care. They also find improvements in patient treatment for some interventions. However, they also find that team care may increase costs. This begs the question under which circumstances team care can enhance the efficiency of treatment compared to solo practice care. This paper’s aim is to provide theoretical guidance regarding this question.====In this paper, I consider two important aspects of chronic care. Firstly, chronically ill patients should receive treatment from an appropriate physician. Which physician should treat a patient crucially depends on the patient’s disease severity. Whereas a primary care physician (PCP) is able to efficiently (as measured by expected net benefit of treatment) treat a patient in mild condition, a specialist’s services are required for a more severe case. This aspect is especially important for chronic diseases as the disease severity of chronically ill patients may change over time. Secondly, treatment efforts exerted today impact health outcomes and costs in the future. The preventive effort of a PCP can decrease the need for future treatment and, thus, decrease costs for the health care system (Dusheiko et al., 2011, de Bruin et al., 2001, Li et al., 2010). Similarly, high-quality specialist treatment can lead to quicker recovery of the patient.====In the main part of the paper I consider two profit-oriented physicians, a PCP and a specialist, who do not internalize patient benefit.==== A profit-oriented physician may provide too little effort because she suffers the costs of effort provision but does not internalize the future health losses of patients. Furthermore, she ignores patient health losses when considering whether to refer a patient.==== As an extension I consider partially altruistic physicians, who care about both their own profits and the patient’s wellbeing.====If physicians work in solo practices, they do not consider the other physician’s profit in their treatment and effort decisions. This can lead to unnecessary costs if patients are not referred who could be treated efficiently by the other physician. Another potential problem is that too little treatment effort may be exerted because cost savings generated by effort exertion may accrue to both physicians. If there is no asymmetric information between the physicians, this ==== can be solved by delivering chronic care in health care teams that are reimbursed by (risk-adjusted) per patient payments as Bodenheimer et al. (2009) propose.==== In this case, cost savings that accrue because of a physician’s decisions can be transferred to that physician with the help of internal profit sharing rules. However, solving the coordination problem is not necessarily efficient if physicians do not fully internalize the patient’s health losses. In this case, they may allocate patients in a way that minimizes costs at the expense of the patient’s health. Furthermore, organizing physicians in a team provides them an opportunity to collude in order to earn larger profits. For example, if specialists are paid larger treatment fees than PCPs, there is an incentive for the PCP to over-refer patients to the specialist. Conversely, assuming that kickback payments between physicians are not allowed, the PCP faces no such incentive in the solo practices. Due to the reasons outlined above, it is not clear which organizational form leads to more efficient treatment.====The aim of this paper is to answer the following question. Under which conditions should a chronically ill patient receive care from a physician team (PCP and specialist) or from independent physicians who work in solo practices? In order to answer this question I derive optimal treatment fees for both physicians in each setting and compare the second-best optimal outcomes between both organizational forms. As an extension, I consider the restriction that the team is paid by a flat treatment fee which does not differ between physicians. The main difference between organizational forms is that in a team, physicians coordinate their referral and effort decisions, whereas in solo practices they do not.====To answer the research question, I develop a model with a PCP and a specialist who treat a fixed number of chronic patients for an indefinite time frame. Patients can either be in a mild condition, which is inexpensive to treat, or in a severe condition, which is costly to treat. The severe condition could, for example, correspond to a diabetes patient who is hyperglycemic or suffers from neuropathic or retinopathic complications. Physicians can exert tertiary preventive effort (time spent on patient, self-help support, appropriate medication, support personnel...) in order to lower the probability that a patient’s condition deteriorates or they can exert curative effort in order to increase the probability that a patient’s condition improves. Further, physicians refer patients between each other and can accept or reject each other’s referrals.====The main innovation of the paper is to analyze physicians’ agency problems relating to effort and referral efficiency in a model that captures the dynamic nature of the chronic care market. Patients’ severity in each period is determined by a (competitive) Markov decision process (see Filar and Vrieze, 1996, for the theoretical background for this type of game). A patient’s probability distribution over the disease severity in the next period is determined by the patient’s current severity, the type of physician treating him, and the exerted effort of the treating physician. Consequently, treatment decisions made by physicians in one period affect the expected costs of care and expected patient health losses in all periods to follow.====Both the severity of the patient’s disease (hidden information) and the effort exerted by the physicians (hidden action) are unknown to the payer contracting with the physicians. In order to achieve efficient outcomes, both physicians should be incentivized to exert effort. Further, patients in the mild condition should receive care from the PCP and patients in the severe condition should receive specialist care. I derive conditions under which physicians in each organizational form exert more effort and/or more adequately refer patients.====There are several advantages of using a dynamic model rather than a static model. First, it captures the provision of non-contractible effort without reference to altruism or pay-for-performance mechanisms that require the payer to have information on outcomes ex-post. Instead, physicians provide effort in order to reduce their own (or their team’s) future costs of care. This allows for contracts with less stringent information requirements and it offers an alternative explanation to altruism for effort in a credence good market. Second, a dynamic model allows for the study of the complete set of treatments and referrals undergone by the patient. This includes a back-referral to the PCP after successful specialist treatment.====I find that if profit-maximizing physicians work in solo practices, it is not possible for the payer to implement optimal referral patterns, though it may be possible in the team. Whether or not this is possible depends on the cost structure and the effectiveness of the physicians’ treatments. In particular, the expected treatment cost differences between the patient types need to be relatively large for the PCP and small for the specialist, i.e. the PCP must have the relative cost advantage when treating patients in mild condition. Markups should be used for PCP treatment, whereas the specialist should be paid below-cost. In the converse case, in which the specialist has the relative cost advantage for mildly ill patients, it can be optimal to organize the physicians in solo practices. This allows the PCP to act as a gatekeeper for the specialist. Mildly ill patients are initially received by the PCP and only referred to specialist care when their state deteriorates. This cannot be implemented in the team because the PCP would always refer mildly ill patients if doing so increases the team’s profits.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the theoretical literature on the topic. Section 3 describes the model used in this paper. Section 4 defines the first-best benchmark. In Section 5, treatment fees for both the team and the solo practice are derived to implement potentially second-best optimal outcomes under the assumption that the payer cannot verify effort provision or the type of the patient. Subsequently, the second-best optimal outcomes for team and solo practice cases are compared. Conditions are derived under which either organizational form is superior. In Section B of the appendix, the case that teams are paid with flat fees and the case that physicians are partially altruistic are considered as extensions.

Our results indicate that the probability that a woman experiences P-IPV increases by 8.5 percentage points (65 percent) after exposure to a dry, but not a wet, shock during the cropping season. We identify two complementary causal pathways of this effect: increased economic insecurity and poverty-related stress that deteriorates men’s emotional well-being and mental health, and reduced female ==== that affects women’s ability to negotiate their preferences within the relationship.","Rainfall shocks constitute one of the most important sources of crop production risk among smallholding farmers in developing countries. Ample research documents that rainfall shocks reduce agricultural productivity (Holden et al., 2001; Chavas et al., 2005; Hansen et al., 2011), generating sizable income losses and decreasing consumption (Wolpin, 1982; Paxson, 1992; Jacoby and Skoufias, 1998; Porter, 2012; Amare et al., 2018) and productive investments (Alem et al., 2010; Dercon and Christiaensen, 2011; Barrett and Carter, 2013; Shiferaw et al., 2015; Amare and Shiferaw, 2017). Even more, and despite being transitory, rainfall shocks can affect developmental outcomes in the short (Hoddinott and Kinsey, 2001; Maccini and Yang, 2009; Rocha and Soares, 2015; Rosales-Rueda, 2018) and long term (Holden et al., 2001; Stanke et al., 2013; Dinkelman, 2017; Shah and Steinberg, 2017; Joshi, 2019).====Less studied, however, are the immediate effects rainfall shocks can pose on intra-family dynamics. In particular, there is scant evidence on how rainfall shocks may affect family bonds. In this paper, we draw attention to the effect rainfall shocks have on one specific dimension of family relations: marital conflict. Specifically, we investigate whether and how exposure to rainfall shocks affects the prevalence of physical intimate partner violence (P-IPV) among women, uncovering the plausibility of multiple mechanisms driving the connection between rainfall shocks and the risk of experiencing P-IPV.====Assessing this impact is of primary interest as intimate partner violence (IPV) constitutes the most common form of violence against women (VAW) and is both a cause and a consequence of gender disparities that manifest in power relations within the couple. Worldwide, nearly 30 percent of women have suffered some form of IPV (Devries et al., 2013) and more than 35 percent of all murders of women are reported to be committed by an intimate partner (WHO, 2012).==== In this regard, IPV is a global concern encompassing a severe health problem (ICRW, 2009; Butchart et al., 2010; Garcia-Moreno and Watts, 2011).====We set our study in the context of rural households in the Andean region of Peru. Several facts motivate our focus on this particular setting. First, the prevalence rates of lifetime and recent IPV in rural Peru – of 61 and 25 percent, respectively – are in the upper tier among countries that record IPV (Garcia-Moreno et al., 2006; Devries et al., 2013). Second, with roughly 80 percent of employment in agriculture and 75 percent of rainfed crop production, living conditions in the Peruvian Andes are intrinsically tied to weather realizations (Ponce et al., 2015). Third, insufficient irrigation infrastructure and the use of ancient farming practices make crop production in this region particularly vulnerable to extreme rainfall events (Escobal, 2005). Fourth, limited access to credit markets in these areas makes it more difficult for households to cope with adverse income shocks (Trivelli, 2000).====Our analysis incorporates spatial data on historical rainfall levels from the University of Delaware’s climate data repository and women’s records on P-IPV from repeated annual cross-sections of the Peruvian Demographic and Health Surveys over 2005–2014. We use these data to track changes in the experience of instances of P-IPV occurring during the past 12 months among women exposed and not to dry or wet shocks during the cropping season in the municipality where they reside. We construct our measure of recent P-IPV using a slightly adapted version of the Conflict Tactic Scales (Straus, 1990) available in our data. We define dry and wet shocks as monthly rainfall falling below or above the 5th or 95th percentiles in the distribution of long-term (1950–2010) local monthly rainfall observed in this season, respectively.====Our principal finding is that women in rural Peruvian Andes experience more P-IPV when exposed to dry (but not wet) shocks. In particular, the probability that a woman experiences instances of P-IPV during the past 12 months increases by 8.5 percentage points (65 percent) after being exposed to a dry shock during the cropping season. This estimate is statistically robust to a variety of falsification and sensitivity tests. We further delve into the details of the aggression and find that the probability that a woman experiences acts of “moderate” P-IPV, such as being pushed/shook, slapped, punched, or kicked/dragged by their partners, increases by 60 percent after dry shocks are observed during the cropping season. Even though these acts do not aim to cause permanent injury to the victim (Bott et al., 2012), we still find a 70 percent increase in women’s reports of sequelae from the physical abuse in the form of bruises or lesions on their bodies.====Borrowing from the literature on IPV (Ellsberg and Heise, 2005; Eswaran and Malhotra, 2011; Bott et al., 2012; Garcia-Moreno et al., 2015; Buller et al., 2018; Tankard and Iyengar, 2018; Peterman et al., 2020; Ranganathan et al., 2021), we identify three main pathways that link exposure to rainfall shocks with instances of P-IPV: (i) household economic insecurity, poverty-related stress, and emotional well-being; (ii) women’s empowerment; and (iii) exposure to aggressive partners.==== Naturally, P-IPV arises from the interplay between these different pathways, either reinforcing or offsetting (Roy et al., 2019). Among them, we assess as many mechanisms as our data allow us to do.====Consistent with our main result, we find that only the exposure to dry shocks induces changes in the mediating factors. We find that household income and consumption expenditures per capita decline by 20 and 15 percent, respectively, after the occurrence of a dry shock during the cropping season. These results indicate that income loss is one of the main drivers of the observed increase in P-IPV and point to the economic hardship generated by dry shocks as a principal mediating channel. We also document increases in men’s marital control, alcohol intake, and alcohol-related aggression — behaviors that link to lower financial command, stress, and anticipatory anxiety from higher economic uncertainty. Yet, we also find a decline in women’s employment and financial autonomy — a result that highlights the importance of female economic opportunities in determining P-IPV.====Our results speak to the vulnerability of women to the occurrence of weather shocks and identify pathways through which social policies can amend this condition. This situation becomes more relevant in the face of climate change as its negative impacts are likely to be harsher among rural populations in developing countries (Morton et al., 2014).==== A back-of-the-envelope calculation using weather projections from the National Center for Atmospheric Research suggests that the prevalence of P-IPV would increase by 3.5 to 4 percentage points (or 25–30 percent) due to more frequent dry shocks that will be observed in the Peruvian Andes over 2025–2034, provided that no adaptation or mitigation strategies will be put in place in the face of climate change.====We contribute to four different strands of the literature. First, our study adds to the literature on rainfall shocks and IPV providing evidence on causal pathways. Previous studies also established a connection between dry shocks and increased IPV, but none have addressed the causal pathways. In particular, three other studies have also evaluated this effect finding mixed results in the context of sub-Saharan African countries. While Cools et al. (2020) find no impact, Abiona and Koppensteiner (2018) and Epstein et al. (2020) document that exposure to dry shocks increases the probability that women experience P-IPV by between 25 to 50 percent.==== We introduce three important extensions that make our study more informative. In terms of methodology, our data integrates information on precipitation across geography and over time, which permits for a clear identification of our effect of interest by harnessing temporary, local variation in rainfall. Concerning the context of study, we provide novel evidence from the rural Andes in Peru, a developing country outside sub-Saharan Africa with a different culture and custom setting. As regards the interpretation of the results, the wealth of data we utilize allows us to thoroughly analyze causal pathways and mechanisms and shed light on the likely channels linking rainfall shocks with P-IPV.====Our findings reinforce the notion that household economic insecurity and poverty-related stress are critical determinants of IPV (Fox et al., 2002; Schneider et al., 2016).==== Also on this matter, we highlight the relevance of female financial autonomy and economic opportunities in balancing the woman’s power position within the relationship, which is particularly relevant in times of economic hardship (Aizer, 2010; Anderberg et al., 2016; Krupoff et al., 2017; Tur-Prats, 2021). Our results, however, contrast those from previous work, arguing that IPV could result from a male retaliation to a lost authority or gender identity as the “family provider” (Chin, 2012; Guarnieri and Rainer, 2018; Garcia-Ramos, 2021).====Second, our study relates to new research showing that economic uncertainty from rainfall shocks can bring forth the existence of gendered power dynamics. This situation manifests, for instance, in the higher probability that parents “marry off” their daughters in societies where marriages involve financial transfers across families (Corno et al., 2020; Corno and Voena, 2021) or the lower probability that parents enroll their daughters in primary schools (Björkman-Nyqvist, 2013) after the occurrence of rainfall shocks. In this line of work, we uncover gender-based relations of power among couples that become apparent in behaviors such as increased marital control from men.====Third, our study provides novel evidence to the climate-conflict literature. For the most part, studies focus on the conflict between unrelated individuals and do not provide hints on the causes of conflict outbreaks due to the lack of history of interactions among disputing parties (Hsiang et al., 2013; Burke et al., 2015). By focusing on marital conflict, we can assess individual and marital relationship dynamics to reveal details on the likely causes of disputes. We emphasize the relevance of loss-of-control on emotions when confronting weather shocks, consistent with recent advances in this area (Burke et al., 2018; Mullins and White, 2019; Baylis, 2020).====From a broader perspective, our paper contributes to a more extensive literature that analyzes the effects of economic shocks and programming on VAW, in general, and on IPV, in particular. As long as these shocks affect intra-household dynamics and the economic and social status of women and men differently, they can affect IPV. Besides the strand of the literature focusing on the effects of rainfall shocks on VAW and IPV, several other papers study the relationship between VAW and IPV and labor market shocks (Aizer, 2010; Heath, 2014; Anderberg et al., 2016; Kotsadam and Villanger, 2020; Bhalotra et al., 2021b; Bhalotra et al., 2021a; Tur-Prats, 2021; Erten and Keskin, 2021a, Erten and Keskin, 2021b), microcredit and the financial inclusion of the poor (Vaessen et al., 2014; Orton et al., 2016; Duvendack and Mader, 2020; Limbikani et al., 2021), and (conditional or unconditional) cash and in-kind transfers (Buller et al., 2018; Roy et al., 2019; Haushofer and Shapiro, 2019; Heath et al., 2020; Díaz and Saldarriaga, 2022). More recently, a flurry of papers explores the effects of health-related policies to contain the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide on VAW and IPV (Peterman and O’Donnell, 2020; Peterman et al., 2020; Peterman et al., 2020a, Peterman et al., 2020b; Bourgault et al., 2021).====Finally, our study has implications for the literature assessing the lifetime effects of weather shocks. Despite the extensive evidence on the negative repercussions on the human capital of individuals exposed to weather shocks during critical developmental stages of life, its causes are not yet fully understood. In this regard, we stress the relevance of the family environment, in general, and intra-family conflict, in particular, as a transmission channel from early-in-life exposure to weather shocks to later-in-life developmental outcomes (Currie and Vogl, 2013; Aizer and Currie, 2014; Doyle and Aizer, 2018).====We organize the paper as follows. Section 2 describes the data and the definition of the variables utilized in the analysis. Section 3 presents our empirical strategy for estimating the effect of exposure to rainfall shocks during the cropping season on women’s probability of experiencing P-IPV. Section 4 reports our main results, several robustness checks, and additional analyses. Section 5 presents our study of causal pathways and mechanisms potentially explaining our main results.

We are the first to study the role of state laws prohibiting youths from indoor tanning using a difference-in-differences research design. We find that youth ITB prohibitions reduced population search intensity for tanning-related information. Among white teen girls, ITB prohibitions reduced self-reported indoor tanning and increased sun protective behaviors. We also find that youth ITB prohibitions significantly reduced the size of the indoor tanning market by increasing tanning salon closures and reducing tanning salon sales.","Skin cancer is the most diagnosed cancer in the United States and – unlike other cancers – has been on the rise in recent years, particularly among young women (ACS 2021). Use of indoor tanning beds, which emit cancer-causing UVA light at concentrations higher than natural sunlight, has been shown to dramatically increase the risk of developing skin cancer. In 2009, the World Health Organization officially classified UV-emitting tanning devices as carcinogenic to humans, and major medical organizations such as the American Academy of Dermatology have recommended bans on indoor tanning by minors (WHO 2017).====Despite scientific agreement regarding the health risks of indoor tanning, use of artificial tanning facilities is common in the US, particularly among white girls and young adult women. In 2009, over one in three white high school females reported indoor tanning in the past year according to estimates from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) (see Fig. 1). In recognition of the popularity of indoor tanning among youths, states have adopted a variety of youth-targeted restrictions on indoor tanning to address this public health concern. As of 2020, 32 states had adopted laws completely prohibiting indoor tanning bed (ITB) use by at least some minors, and 22 states applied these ITB prohibitions to all individuals under the age of 18.====Very little economics research has studied skin cancer or indoor tanning, and to our knowledge no prior work examines youth prohibitions on indoor tanning. This contrasts with extensive work in the economics literature studying other modifiable risk behaviors with youth-targeted prohibitions and minimum legal ages, such as alcohol consumption (Dee 1999; Carpenter and Dobkin 2009), cigarette smoking (Gruber and Zinman 2001; Bryan et al., 2020), e-cigarette use (Friedman 2015), driving (Huh and Reif 2021), dropping out of high school (Anderson 2014), and gun access (Anderson and Sabia 2018). While a public health and medical literature has documented prevalence and trends in indoor tanning behavior and its association with cancer risk (see Watson et al., 2013 for a review), only a handful of studies examine relationships with state policies. Critically, all existing public health studies examining state regulations and ITB use by youths rely on cross-sectional variation in state policies or are single-state evaluations, usually without an untreated control group (Mayer et al., 2011; Guy et al., 2014; Qin et al., 2018).====In this paper we provide the first evidence on the effects of youth ITB prohibitions on a range of tanning-related outcomes. We make several contributions. First, we take an explicitly quasi-experimental approach that leverages within-state changes in youth indoor tanning prohibitions over time to address concerns about unobserved state characteristics and preferences that may contribute both to the presence of tanning bed restrictions and to tanning-related outcomes. This setup allows us to account for time-invariant location-specific attitudes toward tanning bed usage, as well as broader national trends in indoor tanning. Moreover, we make explicit use of within-state variation in the ages of youths who were and were not prohibited by the indoor tanning regulations, allowing us to test sharp predictions about tanning-related behaviors for teens newly bound by a youth indoor tanning prohibition. Second, we consider many more outcomes than have been studied in prior work. By examining changes in tanning-related information-seeking behavior using Google Trends data, our study offers novel insights into the mechanisms through which these prohibitions affect youth indoor tanning. We also offer the first evidence on how these policies affected the tanning salon industry using the National Establishment Time-Series data, allowing us to characterize the broader market wide effects of these policies. This evidence is relevant for both tanning-related health policy and more generally as a way to think about how policies affect economic welfare. Our results are particularly relevant and timely given that the FDA has proposed a nationwide ban on indoor tanning bed use by minors in the United States (FDA 2015). The experiences of US states are likely to produce the most externally valid estimates of the effects of a federal youth indoor tanning ban.====We report several results from this research. First, we find that youth indoor tanning prohibitions significantly reduced indoor tanning behaviors. For example, we find that Google searches for ‘tan’ and ‘tanning’ were significantly less popular following age-based prohibitions on indoor tanning compared to the associated changes in states that did not impose such restrictions. Although Google search data do not indicate ==== search behavior was affected, we use other data to provide evidence that youth ITB prohibitions significantly reduced self-reported indoor tanning participation and intensity by high school age girls. These results are observed in youth self-reports from the state Youth Risk Behavior Surveys from 2009 to 2019. Effects are concentrated among high school age white girls; we find no evidence that youth indoor tanning prohibitions changed tanning behaviors of identically aged boys or black girls. Among white high school age girls, we estimate that a state ITB prohibition reduced the likelihood of indoor tanning by 5.6 percentage points, or about 15 percent relative to the 2009 average for this group. Measured differently, we estimate that youth ITB prohibitions can explain over 20 percent of the overall decline in indoor tanning rates for white high school girls over this period.====We also find clear evidence that youth indoor tanning prohibitions significantly reduced the size of the indoor tanning market. Using panel data on a near universe of tanning salons from the National Establishment Time-Series from 1990 to 2017, we show that state youth indoor tanning prohibitions were associated with statistically significant increases in the likelihood that an indoor tanning salon closed as well as reductions in sales for surviving establishments. Moreover, we find that the negative market size effects of youth indoor tanning prohibitions were stronger for establishments that were likely to have experienced stronger negative demand shocks due to their proximity to middle and high school girls.====Finally, we examine a range of outcomes intended to address possible unintended consequences of state youth ITB prohibitions. We find no evidence that ITB prohibitions were related to youth drinking, smoking, sexual behaviors, weight perceptions, or suicidality for white high school girls, the group whose ITB use was the most directly affected by the policies. In fact, we find evidence that state ITB prohibitions were associated with significant increases in Google search popularity for sun-protective terms such as ‘sunscreen’, and we also find evidence that state ITB prohibitions increased regular sunscreen use by white high school girls.====Taken together, our results suggest that youth prohibitions on indoor tanning were largely successful at reducing indoor tanning by adolescent white girls with relatively little adverse effect except for a predictable and sizable reduction in the size of the indoor tanning salon market. Our results offer a novel demonstration that public health interventions can have important effects on the structure of private markets.====The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 discusses the institutional background of state indoor tanning prohibitions and other regulations. Section 3 reviews the small economics literature and larger public health literature on skin cancer and indoor tanning, including its relationship with state policies.

How to best fund health care in the context of the aging population is a key economic and social policy question in most developed countries, including the United States (U.S.). As people get older, their utilization of health care services increases (U.S. Institute of Medicine Committee, 2008). In 2015, older Americans represented the top 5% of health care users (Zayas et al., 2016), accounting for 61% of doctor visits (Rui and Kang, 2015), 35% of hospital stays (Freeman et al., 2018) and 85% of drug prescription (Martin et al., 2019). Although two-thirds of their spending is paid by the government, through various public insurance programs (De Nardi et al., 2015), older Americans are still expected to co-pay for long hospital stays (====60 days), doctor visits, prescription drugs, and other outpatient services, through out-of-pocket payments or private health insurance (U.S. Centre for Medicare and Medicaid services, 2021). In 2020, older Americans spent up to a fifth of their income on health care services (Carman et al., 2020). Due to its cost, older Americans are more likely to postpone or forgo health care than older adults in other high-income countries (Jacobson et al., 2021).====Housing assets, as a form of wealth, thus play an important role as an additional source of funding for many older adults living on a fixed income and serve as a “self-insurance” mechanism for health care utilization (Joint Center for Housing studies, 2018). On the other hand, liquidity constraints may prevent use of housing wealth to fund health care. Despite its important policy implication, to date, there is limited causal evidence of a wealth effect, especially housing wealth, on older adults’ health care utilization, and existing studies still exhibit four main limitations.====Firstly, most studies to date have focused on income rather than on wealth, especially housing wealth (Braveman et al., 2005). As people get older, income loses its significance, whereas wealth becomes more important as a source of funding (Boyle Torrey and Teauber, 1986, Feinstein, 1993, Alessie et al., 1997, Van Ourti, 2003). Housing equity is the most important asset for a large fraction of the older population (Doling and Elsinga, 2012), and represents a primary source of collateral borrowing (Bhutta and Keys, 2016). This is especially the case for older Americans. In 2018, 78.7 percent of Americans above 65 years old were homeowners and continued to be the owner into older age (Joint Center for Housing studies, 2018). About 80 percent of older Americans’ wealth was held in the form of housing equity (Venti and Wise, 1991). The “wealth effect” hypothesis predicts that homeowners may feel wealthier during a housing boom, thus, are more willing to spend their assets (Doling and Horsewood, 2011). Increasing housing wealth may also make borrowing easier, thus relaxing homeowners’ financial constraints (Campbell and Cocco, 2007, Iacoviello, 2011). Such wealth gains allow older households to consume health care services that could otherwise have been forgone. Therefore, changes in housing wealth may have a large impact on both welfare and consumption in older age (Case et al., 2001, Campbell and Cocco, 2007).====Secondly, most investigations of the wealth–health care nexus are limited to expenditure instead of utilization. While Acemoglu et al. (2013) find a small increase in health expenditure in response to a positive income shock (0.7%), Tsai (2018) estimate a rise between 1.4% and 3.4% in health expenditures of older Americans. Although health expenditure is a good proxy for consumption, an increase in expenditure does not always imply increased utilization. Since expenditure captures both quality and utilization, higher expenditure may reflect better quality services, but not necessarily higher utilization. Indeed, a comparative study reveals that the U.S. population does not use health care more than other countries, but users spend much more than other comparable OECD countries (Papanicolas et al., 2018). Up to now, most studies investigating the effects of wealth on health care utilization are descriptive in nature (Cooper et al., 2012, Rodrigues et al., 2018). An increase in wealth allows a person to afford more health services, but it may also improve health by providing a better lifestyle or by accessing higher quality services (Schwandt, 2018, Pool et al., 2018, Fichera and Gathergood, 2016), thereby reducing the need to seek further health care.====Thirdly, many studies, which attempted to establish such causal effects, have used exogenous variation in economic resources such as oil price shocks, changes in public policy, and housing prices as sources of identification. For example, using changes in Social Security notch, Goda et al. (2011) and Moran and Simon (2006) find that a positive permanent income shock increases utilization of paid home care and prescription drugs. Acemoglu et al. (2013) utilize regional variation in oil prices to investigate the relationship between a permanent income shock and hospitalization. These identification strategies constrain the population of interest. While the first two papers use the same strategy comparing cohorts of pensioners exposed to changes in Social Security notch to pensioners who were not, the third focuses on a modest number of economic subregions in Texas and Los Angeles. Hence, it is unclear whether the empirical findings apply more generally.====Lastly, there have been limited studies breaking down the wealth effects on different types of health services. For example, Cheng et al. (2018) use lottery wins to establish the causal relationship between wealth and health care utilization. They find that lottery winners with larger wins are more likely to choose privately provided health services than publicly provided health services. Extending from Cheng et al. (2018)’s paper, Costa-Font et al. (2019) exploit housing booms and busts to investigate the wealth effects on long-term care utilization. However, these studies are limited to services commonly covered under the public insurance program. Although hospitalization and long term care are the main services used by older people, services that are not widely covered under public insurance programs, such as dental care or prescription drugs, also make up a large proportion of older individuals’ health expenditures (De Nardi et al., 2015). Therefore, breaking down the wealth effects on different types of health services is critical in planning an effective government response to the changes in population health care use, especially during economic downturns.====To our knowledge to date, this is the first paper comprehensively investigating the relationship between housing wealth and health care utilization in a multi-payer system. Our identification strategy relies on observing changes in health care utilization in response to the unanticipated wealth gain/loss created exogenously by the Great Recession. Unlike existing studies, our identification strategy utilizes a more general population of older homeowners in the United States. We also contribute to the existing literature by breaking down our investigation into different types of health services, including services not covered by public insurance, such as dental care. We estimate a Fixed Effect model using within-county variation in house prices as an instrument for housing wealth. We find that health care utilization increases on receipt of a windfall in wealth. Our findings provide additional evidence to the existing studies regarding wealth effects, especially housing wealth. We also explore potential mechanisms, complementing papers linking wealth with health outcomes.====The structure of the paper is as follows. The next section provides a brief introduction to the U.S. health care system, while the third section describes the dataset used in the analysis. Section 4 explains the empirical framework used for identification. Section 5 reports our estimation results and conducts robustness and heterogeneity analysis.

Anorexia is a severe and potentially life-threatening eating disorder, which affects about 0.1 percent of the U.S. population, with similar prevalence rates in other Western countries (GBD, 2016). In order to be diagnosed with anorexia, a person must meet the following DSM-5 criteria: (i) restriction of energy intake leading to significantly low body weight (ii) intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, (iii) distorted body image perception, i.e. perceiving oneself as too fat when being underweight (APA, 2013). A significantly low body weight is commonly conceptualized as 15% or more below the expected weight for one’s age, gender, and height and expressed in a body mass index (bmi) below 17.5 kg/m====. In the brain, anorexia is associated with increased activity of the nucleus accumbens, a region of the ventral striatum that controls reward and motivation. The cause of the disease is basically unknown and treatment remains ineffective for most patients (Nestler, 2013). But long-term studies also showed that more than 50 percent of individuals diagnosed with anorexia recover from the disease with advancing age (Zipfel et al., 2000, Dobrescu et al., 2020). It has been estimated that more than half the risk of developing anorexia is due to genetic factors (Bulik et al., 2000). Anorexia is about ten times more prevalent among women than men. Other risk factors are being an adolescent, having an obsessional style, and the exposure to thin peers and role models.====Anorexia exhibits the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric illness. Up to 10 percent of anorexia patients are estimated to die from suicide (Pompili et al., 2006). Here, I focus on the long-run consequences that are caused by the inadequate supply of energy and nutrients and lead to faster health deficit accumulation, frail bodies, and premature death by ‘natural causes’ such as cardiac diseases and organ failure. Among the long-term effects of anorexia are osteoporosis, cardiovascular disturbances, diabetes mellitus, thyroid disorders, and gastrointestinal disorders. About 80 percent of anorexic patients have cardiac complications, and most sudden cardiac death in anorexic patients is due to abnormal heartbeat (Meczekalski et al., 2013, Casiero and Frishman, 2006). The mortality rate for all causes of death is estimated to be up to six times higher than that of the general population (Meczekalski et al., 2013, Arcelus et al., 2011).====It has been shown that the trait of high self-control is predictive for restrained eating, exercise and weight loss (Crescioni et al., 2011, Cobb-Clark et al., 2014, Stutzer and Meier, 2016). Since anorexia patients are particularly “successful” in weight loss, it has been argued that individuals with anorexia are characterized by high levels of self-control (Fairburn et al., 1999, Steinglass et al., 2012, Butler and Montgomery, 2005).==== Walsh (2013) argues that anorexia is initiated in young women by initial successes in weight control, which then ‘takes on a life of its own and evolves into an unrelenting pursuit that becomes the individual’s primary focus.’ Reinforcement mechanisms make restrained eating and exercise a habit and anchored in neural mechanisms that underlie the formation and persistence of habits. This way, anorexia resembles the neural mechanisms underlying addiction to substance abuse.====The similarity of anorexia to addiction and substance dependence has been highlighted in a series of studies (e.g. Barbarich-Marsteller et al., 2011, Kaye et al., 2013, Godier and Park, 2014, Godier and Park, 2015, Compan et al., 2015). The onset of anorexia, characterized by an initial success in weight loss is experienced as rewarding and pleasurable (resembling the initial phase of an addiction). The positive experiences motivate anorexic individuals to continue setting increasingly more ambitious weight goals (resembling the tolerance effect in addiction). As the disease continues, individuals find it increasingly more difficult to give up restrained eating and to return to healthy behavior and healthy body weight (resembling the withdrawal effect in addictions). The initially positive feelings associated with weight loss, however, cannot be maintained and are replaced by negative feelings associated with not being able to reach the increasingly ambitious target weight. The target weight adjustment implies that, despite increasing emaciation, individuals perceive themselves as to fat (distorted body image) such that the relentless pursuit of weight loss turns into a joyless and painful activity. It is thus understandable that anorexia patients perceive their behavior as an illness and want to be cured from the disease (resembling substance addicts).====In the health-economic theory of anorexia proposed below, I take these features into account. I set up a life cycle model of endogenous health deficit accumulation (based on Dalgaard and Strulik, 2014) in which individuals consume food and non-food goods and invest in their health and exercise. Body size increases with food consumption and declines with exercise. Deviations from a healthy bmi accelerate the speed of health deficits accumulation and, at any age, survival depends on the level of health deficits. While eating behavior and exercise have previously been studied in the obesity-related health deficit model (Strulik, 2019), here I extend the model to include the following features. Individuals derive positive or negative utility from body image, depending on the relative deviation of actual bmi from target bmi. Target bmi may deviate from the healthy bmi because it is socially constructed. In non-anorexic individuals target bmi is constant or changes only occasionally and exogenously. Anorexia is characterized by a habituation process (addiction) that leads to a continuous reduction of target bmi. It is initiated by weight loss successes in individuals who are (genetically) susceptible to target weight updating and for whom body image is an important factor of experienced utility, a feature which implies a high level of self-control in terms of body weight. Individuals are assumed to be perfectly rational except for the fact that they cannot plan their target weight updating. I model this as an imperfectly controlled addiction as proposed in Strulik, 2018, Strulik, 2021. Anorexia is conceptualized as a disease because addiction is unplanned and involuntary. This feature deviates from the standard economic theory of rational addiction built on Becker and Murphy (1988) where addiction is an optimally planned process and therefore cannot be understood as a disease.====While there exists a rich economic literature on overweight and obesity, relatively little attention has been paid to the phenomenon of underweight. The paper is broadly related to theories of rational eating (e.g. Levy, 2002, Levy, 2009, Caputo and Dragone, 2022). In this literature, individuals achieve their individually optimal weight (which may be unhealthy). The feature that actual weight maximizes utility makes it difficult to understand severe underweight as a pathological condition. Here, in contrast, anorexia is explained by an element of bounded rationality in form of unplanned addiction such that anorexic individuals, according to their ==== preferences, would be better off without the disease. Moreover, theories of rational eating usually exhibit one or more steady states of constant, weight-influenced survival probability. Therefore, in contrast to the present model, they cannot be conceptualized as life-cycle models of human aging, since aging is a non-steady-state phenomenon of continuously deteriorating health and declining probability of survival (e.g. Arking, 2006, Gavrilov and Gavrilova, 1991). The cited theories of rational eating also focus on food consumption and ignore alternative uses of income.====A couple of economic studies have addressed the problem of unhealthy underweight. Ham et al. (2013) show that bulimia nervosa is to a large extent driven by path dependence and argue that it shares many characteristics with common addictions (substance abuse). Costa-Font and Jofre-Bonet (2013) show that European women are more likely to be anorexic when they are exposed to low peer-group bmi. Arduini et al. (2019) show that eating disorders (purging) of female adolescents are influenced by peers’ body size through interpersonal comparisons. Dragone and Savorelli (2011) develop a theory of body size evolution where food consumption causes utility, deviations from healthy body weight as well as deviations from socially desirable weight cause utility losses, and eating increases body weight. They show that one of several steady states to which rational individuals converge is characterized by underweight and underconsumption of food. In a society in which individuals are heterogenous with respect to healthy weight and face the same exogenously determined desirable weight, a higher desirable weight reduces the prevalence of unhealthy thinness but may exacerbate the prevalence of obesity. Goldfarb et al. (2009) propose a static model of anorexia as a utility maximizing choice. Since individuals ‘choose to become anorexic’ (p. 13), severe underweight is explained by ‘wrong preferences’ such that, for given preferences, anorexic individuals would not seek and benefit from treatment. In the present study, in contrast, anorexia is initiated by a rational choice to lose weight, which then starts an addiction-like compulsive eating behavior that is not under control of the otherwise fully rational individual. Anorexia is conceptualized as an illness such that, for given preferences, individuals suffering from anorexia benefit from treatment. The static model of Goldfarb et al. (2009) differs also fundamentally from the current life-cycle approach in that it does neither consider the consequence of being underweight on health deficit accumulation and longevity nor the possibility of spending income on purposes other than food consumption.====Other studies focussed on the social determination of body image. Strulik (2014) proposed a theory in which social approval of physical appearance is endogenous and shows how this feature explains the obesity epidemic. The theory focuses on obesity but also takes into account the overall distribution of body weight in society. Further developments of this approach were presented by Mathieu-Bolh (2020) and Mathieu-Bolh and Wendner (2020). Acknowledging the importance of social determination of body image, the present paper applies Occam’s razor and takes social influence as exogenous in order to focus on anorexia as a pathological condition that develops as an uncontrolled addiction. The theory explains why in a group of otherwise similar individuals, exposed to the same socially determined ideal of thinness, anorexia as a health-threatening and potentially fatal illness occurs only in few individuals and why these individuals would be better off without the illness, not only in terms of health, but also in terms of lifetime utility.====The paper is organized as follows. In the next section, I set up the theoretical model, derive the implied dynamics for life cycle behavior, and obtain analytical solutions for optimal food consumption and optimal exercise. In Section 3, I calibrate a benchmark version of the model to an average 16-year-old American female such that predicted health behavior supports a bmi of 28.6 and a life expectancy at 20 of 61 years. An otherwise identical woman endowed with a greater importance of body image is predicted to achieve a bmi of 19 and a 3.2 years higher life expectancy. In Section 4, I show that if a high importance of body image occurs in conjunction with susceptibility to weight loss addiction, a process sets in such that target bmi decreases continuously and actual bmi reaches a trough at 15. The entailed acceleration of health deficits reduces life expectancy by about 15 years. I show how a mechanism of endogenous recovery explains why anorexia is primarily a disease of adolescents and young adults. With advancing age and accumulating health deficits, physical exercise becomes increasingly painful and the ambitious weight goals set in youth can no longer be met. If individuals respond by gradually upgrading their target bmi, a healthy weight is regained in middle age. I also use the model to evaluate two stylized therapies. I show that resetting the target weight has no long-run success since the mechanism of weight loss addiction remains operative and is re-triggered by subsequent weight loss. In contrast, a body image reset, can be effective in inducing a sustained return to healthy eating and exercise behaviors.====I then turn to a calibration for a young man and try to give an explanation of why the disease is much more common in women than in men. Finally, I consider the phenomenon of anorexia athletica. The paper was partly inspired by the fate of Bahne Rabe, a 2 meter tall German rower who won the Olympic gold medal with the eights in 1988 when he had a bmi of 23.7 and who died of a lung infection in 2001 shortly before his 38th birthday with a bmi of 14.6 (Kurbjuweit, 2001). I develop a variant of the model that shows how anorexia athletica can be triggered by an individual’s propensity to exercise excessively.

We highlight a positive spatial dependence in prices for all specialties that increases with physician density. This result reflects markets in which both prices are strategic complements and incentives for quality competition are low. We also find evidence of potential noncompetitive behavior for two specialties for which price and competition measures are positively related. These findings in the context of a growing spatial concentration of free-billing physicians emphasize key mechanisms explaining the increasing of additional fees.,"The growing medical desertification in most OECD countries driven by an increasing spatial concentration of physicians (Pál et al., 2021) is a prominent concern for policy-makers. If medical desertification is an important issue for accessibility to care services, then another dimension that has received less attention from economists is the consequences of the pricing of physician services (see Gaynor and Town, 2012). This could be another major concern, especially in OECD countries,==== which allow some or all of their physicians to set their prices freely. Indeed, in these countries, the pricing of physician services is an important factor that influences the healthcare affordability.====France is an interesting context in which to explore physicians’ pricing decisions and their consequences. Approximately 40% of physicians (CNAMTS, 2017), mainly specialists, are able to balance bill their patients based on no other limit than their evaluation of “tact and moderation”. The part of the bill that is above the regulated fee is not covered by National Health Insurance (NHI)====. Moreover, as physicians in France are free to choose their location, the geographical concentration of free-billing physicians reinforces concern for healthcare access. There is a well-known risk that free-billing physicians are located in similar attractive locations characterized by excess demand at regulated prices, high income and amenities (see Feldman and Sloan, 1988). The study on the location of liberal health professionals in France proposed by Barlet and Collin (2009) supports this idea as physician specialists such as gynecologists, pediatricians or ophthalmologists are strongly spatially concentrated in large metropolitan areas.====The objective of this paper is to provide new robust evidence on free-billing physicians’ pricing behavior by developing a structural approach. This is an important and necessary step to better understand which kind of policy tools could limit additional fees and improve care affordability. To achieve this objective, we make several contributions to the existing literature. First, we develop a closed-form solution of a circular city model with heterogeneous physicians where consultation quality influences both patients’ utility and physicians’ costs. This allows us to highlight and discuss how individual and competitors’ quality influence equilibrium prices but also to provide new insights concerning the effects of competition. Second, we are able to structurally identify core parameters of the model by building a unique geolocalized database of more than 4000 free-billing physicians from three specializations (ophthalmology, gynecology and pediatrics). We develop a general two-step spatial generalized method of moments (GMM) procedure allowing us to control for sample selection bias, endogeneity and an unknown distribution of errors. As shown by Fingleton and Le Gallo (2010) and Kelejian and Prucha (2010), a general GMM estimator allows flexible assumptions for identification in the presence of these issues. Indeed, unlike the quasi-maximum likelihood (Q-ML) estimator, it does not require complete knowledge of the distribution of the spatial data. The different robustness checks and the sensitivity analysis to measurement error reinforce the reliability of our findings. Finally, our empirical results provide important insights. We find for all specialties a significant positive spatial autocorrelation (dependence) in prices. This means that physicians’ prices are strategic complements as a physician’s price increases with its competitors’ prices. Moreover, we validate our prediction that the strength of strategic complementarity in prices increases with physician density. According to our theoretical model, a positive spatial dependence in prices also reflects a market where incentives to compete for quality are low. Our findings corroborate this, as we do not find a significant impact of consultation quality on physicians’ prices. Our empirical results also suggest the potential existence of noncompetitive behavior, especially for ophthalmologists and gynecologists. Indeed, for these two specialties, prices increase with both the competition intensity measured by the average distance to first-degree contiguity competitors and the effective level of competition measured by the proportion of free-billing physicians among competitors.====The body of evidence collected in our study points towards a type of market that provides weak incentives to react to classical competitive mechanisms (both vertical and horizontal differentiation). In the context of increasing spatial concentration of physicians in metropolitan areas, our results highlight key mechanisms to explain the continuous (and heterogeneous) rise of additional fees in France.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

Commonly, transition probabilities among discrete health states are calculated directly from one-wave-ahead transitions observed in panel data. The predicted dynamics of SRHS generated from these calculations rapidly deviate from empirical transitions more than one wave ahead, as the assumption of a Markovian process is not satisfied. Consequently, models that treat SRHS as a true representation of health are not well calibrated to accurately match the long term dynamics of individual health. This paper specifies a model in which SRHS is a noisy measure of a continuous latent health state. I estimate the model by ==== on several panel datasets, exploiting long sequences of SRHS rather than simple wave-to-wave transitions. By accounting for transitory reporting error, the latent health model is able to match both short-run and long-run SRHS transitions up to twenty years in the future, as well as other features of empirical SRHS dynamics. Moreover, the measure of latent health is at least as good at predicting other outcomes (including mortality, labor supply, and medical expenses) as SRHS itself. To aid structural modelers in replacing their representation of health, I provide simple software tools for generating a discretized latent health process, and for filtering observed sequences of SRHS into (a distribution of) latent health.","Dynamic structural models of individuals often concern decisions for which health status is an important state variable. For example, DeNardi et al. (2010) examine how the strong serial correlation of medical expenses motivates the saving behavior of the elderly, and Aizawa (2019) models how workers sort between jobs depending on whether they offer employer-sponsored insurance. Papers in this vein often model health as a discrete state and use categorical ==== (SRHS) as their sole empirical measure of health.==== Despite its simplicity, SRHS has been shown to be a good predictor of mortality and medical expenses (Idler and Benyamini, 1997) as well as labor supply decisions (Bound, 1991), and is strongly correlated with both clinical measures of health (LaRue et al., 1979) and itemized self-reports of more specific aspects of health (Blundell et al., 2017).====In this paper, I argue that the literature has often erred in its interpretation of SRHS and the treatment of its dynamics. The traditional approach treats the coarse categorization as an accurate representation of “true health”– it takes SRHS literally. Modelers often assume that the discrete health state follows a Markov(1) process, with the distribution of subsequent states determined only by current SRHS, demographic variables, and (potentially) health inputs. They estimate this process using one-wave-ahead transitions of SRHS from panel data, often by simple frequency counts or reduced form methods.====However, as observed by DeNardi et al. (2018) (inter alia), SRHS is not actually Markovian in the data. Consequently, the predicted distribution of health states generated by such “simple dynamics” swiftly deviates from the empirical distribution more than one wave ahead. To the extent that model agents’ optimal behavior depends on their beliefs about their future health prospects (e.g. via the need to maintain a buffer of assets against catastrophic medical expenses), counterfactual simulation of these models is unreliable if the long run dynamics of individual health are incorrectly specified.====Rather than treating categorical SRHS as an accurate measure of true health, I provide strong evidence that SRHS is better interpreted as a noisy signal of a continuous latent health state, as in Bound et al. (2010); further, latent health itself has Markovian dynamics. When someone is asked for her SRHS, their latent health is projected onto a discrete space of possible replies, subject to reporting error. That is, there is some partition of the space of “true health” and an individual’s SRHS represents a noisy report of which subset their health falls in. Under this interpretation, a change in an individual’s self-report of categorical health from one wave of a survey to the next represents a combination of transitory reporting error (e.g. the respondent’s mood) and a true change in her health.====Section 2 presents a fairly parsimonious model of this data-generating process for SRHS. When estimated by maximum likelihood on long panel data, the model is able to reproduce conditional distributions of SRHS up to twenty years ahead while still matching short run, one-wave transitions and mortality conditional on demographics. Health is much more persistent in the estimated latent health model than in the usual approach that does not account for reporting error in SRHS. The estimated model reveals a significant degree of heteroskedasticity in reporting errors across individuals—a small fraction of survey respondents account for a disproportionate share of SRHS transitions, due to inaccurate self-reports rather than changes in their true health status.====In Section 4, I present estimation results for a dataset that combines two long panel surveys, the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and the Health & Retirement Study, but similar results are achieved from each dataset independently, or when estimated on short panel data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Study. In addition to matching the future distribution of SRHS (conditional on its state in the baseline period), the estimated model reproduces the extent of duration dependence in empirical SRHS transition probabilities, as well as the distribution of the frequency of reports of bad health over an extended period.====In recent work, DeNardi et al. (2018) propose modeling binary SRHS dynamics as Markov(2), directly accounting for duration dependence by making transition probabilities dependent on the previous period’s SRHS along with its current value. They show that their model is able to reproduce the empirical dynamics of binary SRHS, including the extent of duration dependence and the distribution of the frequency of unhealthy periods across the population. In Section 4.3, I show that the latent health model reproduces the same features of SRHS dynamics as targeted in DeNardi et al. (2018). Further, the Markov(2) binary health model predicts that, conditional on the current state, lagged SRHS should not be predictive of health-motivated outcomes like medical spending, retirement, and mortality. However, I show that this is not the case in panel data, and that the latent health model fairly accurately reproduces these empirical patterns. That is, by recognizing that SRHS is a noisy measure of an unobserved state that usually moves sluggishly, both current and lagged SRHS are informative signals of true health, and thus predictive of health-driven outcomes. The present model explains the non-Markovian dynamics of SRHS, rather than assuming them as a feature of health itself.====The estimation method for the latent health model exploits long sequences of SRHS observations for each respondent, rather than just one-wave-ahead transitions. The key goal of the estimation is to separate transitory reporting shocks from the underlying dynamics of latent health by accounting for the econometrician’s uncertainty about a respondent’s latent health, tracking its nonparametric distribution. That is, each observation of SRHS improves the econometrician’s confidence about the true value of latent health, while the passage of time from one survey wave to the next introduces unobserved shocks to the latent health stock, expanding uncertainty. Likewise, observing the respondent still alive in a subsequent period provides a small bit of information about her true health state, as she was more likely to have survived if she had been healthier in the first place.====In contrast to the latent health model, models that treat SRHS as the true health state significantly underestimate the stability of health over the course of an individual’s life. By interpreting a change in SRHS as a true change in health and considering only one-wave-ahead transitions, the longer run dynamics of health are not accurately reproduced in such models. Consider two respondents with identical observed data, both of whom reported “good” health in the most recent wave of a panel study; they differ only in that one reported “fair” health in the prior wave, while the other reported “very good” health. A model that takes SRHS literally would predict that the two respondents have the same likelihood of reporting “very good” health in the ==== wave, contrary to empirical evidence. Alternatively, a model that incorporates exogenously heterogeneous health dynamics across individuals (e.g. through genetic variation) but treats SRHS as “true health” might predict different probabilities over subsequent SRHS for the two respondents, but based on a potentially spurious inference about differences between their health processes.====The modeling choice to use ==== error to account for short run volatility in SRHS, rather than transitory shocks to true health,==== is motivated by Crossley and Kennedy (2002), who find that 28% of respondents change their SRHS if asked twice in the same interview. The extent of churn in SRHS before and after taking a relatively short survey about specific health conditions suggests that reporting error is present in SRHS responses. Likewise, the Medical Expenditure Panel Study (MEPS) mails a short survey to respondents after waves 2 and 4 of their panel, the Self-Administered Questionnaire (SAQ), which includes a nearly identical SRHS question. Empirical transition probabilities in the two week span between the MEPS interview and the SAQ are similar to those of a six month gap between interview waves, suggesting that the reported changes do not reflect the dynamics of health itself. To provide support for the modeling assumption, I show in Section 4.3 that the respondents who the latent health model judges to be ==== in reporting their SRHS also exhibit the lowest correlation between SRHS and an objective measure of health (and vice versa).====The model presented here follows very recent work by Hosseini et al. (2022), who construct a “frailty index” by summing indicators of adverse health– a composite measure based on objective reports. They compare the dynamics of the frailty index with those of SRHS, finding that health is more persistent than indicated by SRHS changes, analogous to the implications of the latent health model. They estimate the dynamics of the frailty index using three panel surveys with fairly rich data on health conditions and medical history, generating a more refined and precise measure of each respondent’s health at a point in time. The latent health model is estimated on data from the same three surveys, but uses ==== SRHS to gauge a respondent’s true health. It can thus be applied to panel datasets with only cursory health information but still extract a more refined view of health dynamics.====To make it easy for other researchers to incorporate the latent health model into their own work, this project includes a lightweight software archive that can generate two kinds of data files. First, it produces a “filtration dataset” that can be merged into panel data to add the model’s prediction of each respondent’s latent health (in distribution) and probabilities over their reporting type; the filtration conditions on the respondent’s sex, age, and sequence of recently reported SRHS. Second, it can produce a discretized latent health process (to the user’s specifications) based on the estimated parameters reported here and in the Online Appendix, or a custom parameter set. The latent health transition matrices, survival probabilities, and SRHS reporting probabilities it calculates can be easily imported into a structural model, so that simulated outcomes reproduce the complex empirical patterns of SRHS (so that the moments targeted in the estimation can be conditioned on a data-analogous feature) while better capturing underlying health dynamics. In principle, such a model would be no more difficult to solve than an analogous version using SRHS as the health state: it merely swaps one discrete state for another, and the difference between latent health versus SRHS is accounted for by a purely transitory shock.====The paper proceeds as follows. The remainder of this section discusses how health dynamics have been modeled in the structural literature, with a focus on models that treat SRHS as true health, then briefly shows how commonly used assumptions deviate from empirical evidence. Section 2 introduces my latent health model and describes how its parameters are identified through maximum likelihood estimation.

Between 1999 and 2020, over 932,000 people died of drug poisonings—about the same number of US soldiers that died in all armed conflicts from the Civil War through the present day (about 990,000).==== As the drug crisis has developed, research has documented the impact of the epidemic on employment (Aliprantis and Schweitzer, 2018; Harris et al., 2020; Currie et al., 2019; Powell, 2021a), crime (Doleac and Mukherjee, 2022; Szalavitz and Rigg, 2017; Dave et al., 2021), infant health (Ziedan and Kaestner, 2020), marriage (Kaestner and Ziedan, 2020), enrollment in disability insurance programs (Cutler et al., 2017), and intimate partner violence (Stone and Rothman, 2019).====An important feature of the crisis is that it has primarily impacted people in early adulthood through mid-life. As Fig. 1 shows, the drug death rate (deaths/100,000) between 1999 and 2019 was highest for those between the ages of 25 and 54—an age range in which many will be parents of young children and adolescents. In this paper, we examine how this drug crisis among adults has affected the living arrangements of children. Drug use could separate a child from one or both parents through several pathways. First, a parent who is using drugs could leave the household voluntarily, or be asked to leave by a family member. The parent could be absent due to enrollment in a substance abuse treatment program, or due to incarceration because of a crime related to the abuse. If the drug use results in child abuse or neglect, the child welfare system could become involved, increasing the chance of a court-ordered placement with another relative or a foster family. The child could also move into the home of a family friend or relative to protect them from the consequences of the parent's use. Finally, a child's parent could have been one of the many people who have died because of the crisis.====There is abundant anecdotal evidence in the popular press which suggests that many children are indeed experiencing these kinds of events. A 2016 article in the Wall Street Journal reported that “Social workers say the scale of the trouble exceeds anything they saw during the crack-cocaine or methamphetamine crises of previous decades” and quoted a child welfare worker who warned that “honestly, if something doesn't happen with this addiction crisis, we can lose a generation of kids” (Whalen, 2016). Outlets including Vox, NBC, PBS, CNN, and the Associated Press have noted that grandparents are increasingly assuming parenting responsibilities because of the opioid crisis—especially in states that have been hard-hit.==== National statistics support the observations in these stories—between 1980 and 2018, the fraction of children living in a household headed by a grandparent more than doubled from 3.7 to 8.3%.====In recent years, researchers have documented a relationship between the drug crisis and foster care. The number of children entering or living in foster care and the fraction of removals from the home related to drugs have increased (Meinhofer and Anglero-Diaz, 2019). Counties with higher opioid poisoning death rates or drug prescriptions have been shown to have more foster care entries and child removals (Radel et al., 2018; Quast, 2018; Quast et al., 2018; Quast et al., 2019; Bullinger and Ward, 2021). While some work has shown that state-mandated prescription drug monitoring programs have worked to reduce child welfare removals (Gihleb et al., 2022; Bullinger and Ward, 2021), other work suggests that recent opioid supply restrictions may have increased child maltreatment (Evans et al., 2022).====Our paper contributes to this nascent literature in two key ways. First, as we describe in detail below, previous estimates of the relationship between the severity of the crisis and child living arrangements potentially suffer from both omitted variables bias and reverse causality. Changes in the economy or in the strength of institutions could affect both drug abuse rates and child living arrangements, while a separation from one's children could increase either the motivation for using drugs or the number of opportunities to do so. To overcome these challenges, we use an instrumental variables strategy that exploits variation across states and over time in children's exposure to triplicate prescription laws. Alpert et al. (2022) show that because the producers of the most frequently abused prescription opioid marketed the drug less aggressively in states with these laws, the drug crisis was less severe. We use this variation in an instrumental variables framework to estimate the effect of the drug crisis on children's living arrangements.====Second, while the previous literature has focused on the relationship between the crisis and foster care admissions, we consider its effects on parental absence and on the likelihood of living in a household headed by someone other than a parent. These are important outcomes to consider, as many of the pathways we describe above would not necessarily result in a formal foster care placement. Indeed, our results reveal that moves into these more informal arrangements are much more common than moves into the foster care system. For example, at the end of 2015, there were 135,000 children in the foster care system with parental drug abuse listed as a contributing reason for removal; this is an upper bound on the number of removals due to the opioid crisis as it includes all drugs as well as children who would not have been removed on the basis of the drug abuse alone.==== Meanwhile, we estimate that in that same year, 1.5 million children aged 0–16 were living away from a mother or a father, and just over 270,000 were living away from ==== parents as a direct result of the crisis. About 941,000 children are in a household with a non-parent as the household head, with 43% of these living in a household headed by a grandparent. We also provide evidence that hundreds of thousands of children are living in households with fewer resources as a result of the crisis.====To conduct this analysis, we use data from the March Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC) to the monthly Current Population Survey (CPS) from 1990 through 2015. We construct age-state-year cell rates of different living arrangements for children aged 0–16, and pair these with estimates of children's exposure to the crisis that are constructed from the National Center for Health Statistics Multiple Cause of Death (MCOD) data from 1973 to 2015. Our measure of exposure to the crisis is the cumulative drug-related death rate for likely parents over the child's life; this measure accounts for the fact that a transition to the child's current living arrangement could have occurred at any point in the child's life, and older children have had more exposure to the crisis than younger children. While our measure is based on drug deaths, the death of a parent is not the only way that a child could experience a change in their living arrangements. We view our measure as a proxy for how severe the crisis has been in their state over their lifetime. In OLS models with state, age, and year fixed-effects, we document a strong correlation between this measure and child living arrangements. Our 2SLS estimates suggest that the relationship is causal—OLS and 2SLS results are similar in magnitude and we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the 2SLS estimates are equal to their OLS counterparts for most outcomes. We show that greater exposure to the crisis increases the chance that a child's mother or father is absent from the household and it increases the likelihood that he or she lives in a household headed by a grandparent.====It is important to note that the variation we exploit corresponds to a particular counterfactual: a world without the drug crisis. While having a child live away from a parent who is using drugs could be a constrained optimal decision conditional on being affected by the drug crisis, this does not imply that the child is better off than she would have been ====. In the penultimate section of the paper, we discuss research from across the social sciences which suggests that the changes in living arrangements that we document will have harmful long-term consequences for a great many of these children.",The drug crisis and the living arrangements of children,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629622001370,31 December 2022,2022,Research Article,23.0

Between 2010 and mid-2019, ten states and two large counties adopted ENDS taxes. We use two large national surveys (Monitoring the Future and the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System) to estimate the impact of ENDS taxes on youth tobacco use. We find that ENDS taxes reduce youth ENDS consumption, with estimated ENDS ==== elasticities of -0.06 to -0.21. However, we estimate sizable ==== cigarette cross-tax effects, suggesting economic substitution between cigarettes and ENDS for youth. These substitution effects are particularly large for frequent cigarette smoking. We conclude that the unintended effects of ENDS taxation may considerably undercut or even outweigh any ==== gains.","In 2009, public health officials in the United States established Healthy People 2020 goals, one of which was to reduce the youth smoking rate from 19.5% to 16.0% by 2019 (HealthyPeople.gov, 2020). In the introduction to a 2012 Surgeon General report on smoking, Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius warned that “…youth and adult smoking rates that had been dropping for many years have stalled” (US Department of Health Human Services, 2012). This situation quickly changed, however, as youth smoking rates fell to 6.0% by 2019, thus surpassing the Healthy People 2020 objective by 386%. What caused such an unanticipated decline in youth cigarette smoking?==== One candidate is the introduction of electronic cigarettes and other electronic nicotine delivery systems (“ENDS”). ENDS were first imported into the US in August 2006 (CASAA, 2020) and overtook cigarettes as the most commonly used tobacco product among youth in 2014 (Pesko and Warman, 2021). In 2019, 32.9% of youth used an ENDS over the past 30 days, while 10.7% used ENDS frequently; that is, on 20 or more of the past 30 days (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020).====On the whole, the current scientific consensus is that ENDS are likely substantially less dangerous than combustible tobacco products (e.g., cigarettes), which are estimated to kill 480,000 Americans annually (US Surgeon General, 2014). However, the exact relative risks remain uncertain. Based on data from an August 2020 survey of 137 tobacco scholars, the mean (median) tobacco expert believed that the effect of vaping ENDS on quality-adjusted life expectancy was 37% (25%) as large as the effect of smoking (Allcott and Rafkin, 2021). Accounting for harms to others as well as the user, a 2013 expert panel concluded that ENDS were unlikely to exceed 5% of the harm of cigarettes (Nutt et al., 2014), a statistic cited in subsequent reviews of evidence on ENDS’ effects sponsored by Public Health England (McNeill et al., 2018). While the US debate does not use a specific estimate for these products’ relative risks, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's 2018 report concluded that “…e-cigarettes appear to pose less risk to an individual than combustible tobacco cigarettes” and “…e-cigarette aerosol contains fewer numbers and lower levels of toxicants than smoke from combustible tobacco cigarettes.” Health costs may be higher, however, for informally sourced ENDS products than mainstream commercial ENDS because of unknown additives.====ENDS may affect youth health differently than adult health. One commonly cited reason is the potential deleterious effects of nicotine on youth brain development. However, as this evidence is based mostly on studies of rodents (US Surgeon General, 2016), the relationship's generalizability to humans is unclear (Balfour et al., 2021). Similarly, the magnitude of the danger posed by nicotine compared to other substances like alcohol, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), caffeine, and sugar on adolescent brain development is also unclear.====Another commonly-voiced concern is the 2016 Surgeon General report's conclusion that “…e-cigarette use is strongly associated with combustible tobacco product use” (US Surgeon General, 2016). However, the idea that this association reflects a causal effect of ENDS use on subsequent smoking is inconsistent with the typical directionality of uptake over time—daily smoking is more common among young adults who tried cigarettes before ENDS (Friedman et al., 2019; Etter, 2018). This stated association also fails to accurately forecast rapidly declining youth cigarette use. Despite causal evidence that reducing ENDS access increases youth smoking (Pesko, 2022b), the Surgeon General has declared high rates of youth ENDS use to be an epidemic (US Surgeon General, 2018).====Policies designed to reduce access to ENDS therefore appear to prioritize the goal of reducing nicotine use—nicotine which has limited adverse effects on health outside of causing addiction—over the goal of harm reduction, which recognizes substitution from higher to lower-risk nicotine products by people who would not otherwise be able to quit as a benefit for public health. Such regulations have been increasing over time, beginning with ENDS minimum legal sales ages of 18 or higher implemented in all states between 2010 and 2016. As of March 2022, 30 states had adopted ENDS taxes (Public Health Law Center, 2022) while 23 had added ENDS to their existing indoor smoking laws (American Non-Smokers Rights Foundation, 2021).====Despite significant interest in the effect of regulation on youth ENDS use, studies have not yet estimated the effect of ENDS taxes on youth ENDS and combustible tobacco product use. We explore this question using two nationally representative datasets: Monitoring the Future (MTF) and the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS). Specifically, we use a continuous treatment difference-in-differences research design to estimate the relationship between ENDS taxes and a variety of outcomes, including ENDS use, combustible tobacco product use, sources of ENDS products (e.g., online purchasing, brick-and-mortar retailers, social sources), and perceived risk of ENDS use. In both MTF and YRBSS, we find that ENDS taxes reduce youth ENDS use and raise youth cigarette use, with evidence of particularly large effects on using these products regularly. We also find evidence that ENDS taxes raise perceptions of ENDS risk and shift the manner that youth obtain ENDS from retail sources to social sources.====By documenting both intended and unintended effects of ENDS taxation on youths, this study's findings contribute to determining optimal ENDS tax policy. In particular, our results speak directly to the question of whether ENDS accessibility reduces youth combustible tobacco use. If this indirect effect on youth tobacco use is positive and large, and the direct harms of ENDS use are small, then imposing large taxes on ENDS products could conceivably ==== public health on net.",Intended and unintended effects of e-cigarette taxes on youth tobacco use,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629622001345,15 December 2022,2022,Research Article,24.0

Our analysis indicates that the Australian Age Pension reform aimed at working career prolongation has not crowded out the supply of informal care.,"Population aging has placed growing pressure on the sustainability of pension systems in many countries (Harper, 2014). Governments have enacted changes to social security rules to prolong working lives and retain seniors in the labor force (Maestas and Zissimopoulos, 2010, Behaghel and Blau, 2012). These strategies are likely to have significant consequences for many aspects of people’s lives, one of which is informal care provision. The continual aging of society is expected to raise the demand for informal care. However, whether the increasing care needs will be met depends critically on the supply of unpaid care. Since individuals older than the standard retirement age provide a large share of informal care (Colombo et al., 2011), it is often argued that rising workforce participation of the elderly can threaten the potential availability of informal carers (Carrino et al., 2019, Bergeot and Fontaine, 2020, Fischer and Muller, 2020, Fischer and Korfhage, 2022). Whether this argument is correct or not depends on the assumption that seniors with less free time provide a lower amount of informal care to those in need of assistance or support.====When elderly individuals are induced to stay longer in the workforce by pension system reforms, the opportunity cost of their time for informal caregiving increases (Carmichael and Charles, 2003). For this reason, delayed retirement is expected to result in a reduction in the supply of unpaid care. Increased earnings from the labor market might also allow older people to purchase formal care services for care receivers rather than provide informal care themselves (Bonsang, 2009). However, if caregiving needs are inflexible, seniors may reduce their time allocated for other activities to work more in the labor market (He and McHenry, 2016). In this case, the level of their informal caregiving may not change. Therefore, a priori, whether postponed retirement reduces caregiving activities is unclear.====The influence of retirement on the provision of unpaid care is ultimately an empirical question.==== However, there are several empirical challenges involved in establishing the causal link. Omitted variables may be correlated with both retirement decision and caregiving behavior (Heitmueller, 2007). Reverse causality becomes a concern if unpaid care affects the timing of retirement. For example, Korfhage (2019) shows that informal care obligations can lead to hastened retirement decisions among elderly individuals.====A limited number of studies have employed quasi-experimental approaches to convincingly isolate the causal impact of retirement on informal care provided to older adults or those with long-term health conditions or disabilities.==== Carrino et al. (2019) use data from the Understanding Society survey and show that increasing women’s labor supply in older age by raising State Pension qualifying age can substantially reduce the intensity of their informal care in the UK. Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), Fischer and Muller (2020) find that elderly women, who are induced by the variation in the German pension system to retire later, have significantly reduced their supply of informal care to adult persons in need. Those who would have provided low-intensity care in retirement react the strongest to the pension reform, while the provision of high-intensity care by females is not impacted. Bergeot and Fontaine (2020) exploit the variation in retirement rules between and within European countries. Using data from the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), they show that retirement does not affect the probability of extra-residential care provided to own parents, but significantly increases the frequency of unpaid care among caregivers. Therefore, the pension system reforms in Europe have the potential to reduce the intensity of involvement among caregivers but not the number of carers. Lastly, Fischer and Korfhage (2022) develop a comprehensive life-cycle model of elder parent care and assess options for resolving conflicts between pension and long-term care policies. Validating the model exploiting a quasi-experimental setting in Germany, their policy simulations using the SOEP data show a decline in the supply of informal care as retirement ages rise.====This paper examines the impact of retirement on informal care provision, using nationally representative panel data from the Household, Income and Labor Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey. To identify the causal impact, we exploit the publicly funded Australian Age Pension system, which has introduced variation in pensionable ages across gender and birth cohorts and thus changed the retirement incentives of older people. Before 1995, the Age Pension eligibility age was 60 for women and 65 for men. From July 1995 to July 2013, the age threshold for women increased from 60 to 65 at a rate of six months every two years. The eligibility age remained constant during 2014–2016. In July 2017, it started rising again by six months every two years for both men and women. This reform will continue until July 2023, when the qualifying age for both genders will be 67. Our analysis is based on the gender and cohort specific eligibility age for the Australian Age Pension. Specifically, we employ the fixed effects instrumental variable (FE–IV) approach and use the age eligibility for the Age Pension as the instrumental variable for retirement. We are able to analyze the causal link between retirement and informal caregiving among elderly Australians and thus provide one of the first empirical evidence outside Europe.====We also contribute to the literature in other ways. Previous contributions have studied the impact on informal care of retirement status, which represents a discrete change in lifestyle. However, this is only one of the two dimensions of retirement. This paper additionally examines the effect of retirement duration that relates to a continual and cumulative process of being inactive in the labor market. Furthermore, our analysis is comprehensive relative to the extant literature. We consider all possible types of care recipients including spouse/partner, parent(s), parent(s)-in-law, adult child, young child, other relative, and other (unrelated person), who require care due to their long-term health condition, old age, or disability.==== We also account for the difference between co-residential and extra-residential care and between male and female carers.====To preview the results, we find robust evidence that neither retirement status nor retirement duration causally affects co-residential or extra-residential informal care provided by older men and women. The time that elderly individuals contribute to unpaid care is insensitive to their retirement behavior. This finding does not differ by the type of care recipient. We further explore how elderly Australians handle the time conflict between unpaid caregiving and labor supply, given the incentive provided by the increased eligibility age for pension benefits to stay longer in the workforce. We show that the time conflict is resolved by substantially reducing the time spent on other non-market activities (e.g., chores at home, hobbies, and physical activities). Overall, our findings suggest that the increases in pensionable age in Australia have helped prolong the working lives of elderly people without impeding their unpaid care provision.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the institutional background in Australia. Section 3 discusses the data and variables, and Section 4 explains the identification strategy.

The latter is more severe for children born in isolated areas.","Disruptions in agricultural production often lead to detrimental effects for many households in developing countries, with serious repercussions for young children. This amplifies the negative impact of these shocks since conditions experienced early in life have long-lasting effects on various socioeconomic outcomes. In particular, it is well established that harsh conditions experienced in utero can have detrimental and persistent effects on health throughout the whole life cycle (Lavy et al., 2020, Almond and Currie, 2011, Maccini and Yang, 2009, Stein et al., 1975).====In this paper, we study the impact, on child health, of exposure to an agricultural shock that is indirectly linked to extreme weather conditions and climate change: the damage caused by desert locust plagues. Locust swarm invasions are destructive events that recurrently put food supply in many developing countries at risk (especially in sub-Saharan Africa, see Brader et al., 2006). They are caused by a specific species of grasshoppers that usually live, in their solitary phase, around the Sahara desert. Under favorable breeding conditions (excess rainfall), these grasshoppers go through a gregarization process with substantial changes in their behavior, morphology, and physiology. They become more voracious and can grow into huge swarms that travel to less arid areas to feed and reproduce.====We focus on how this shock operates in areas with a single harvest per year.==== We argue that agricultural shocks due to pest invasion can affect households living in this type of economy through two main channels. The first channel is a ==== that kicks in immediately during the growing season in which the plague is occurring, in anticipation of the upcoming harvest failure. At this point, households and markets are still relying on the harvest from the previous agricultural season. Yet, crop destruction by the pest in the ongoing season could lead to an anticipation of a future crop production decline. This “bad news” may affect the supply and demand of crops on the markets before the actual shock.==== The second channel is the actual ==== that would constitute an income shock for farmers and a supply shock for markets after the harvest of affected crops. This effect should last at least until the following harvest.==== We can separately identify these two effects because they kick in at different points in time.====We explore in detail these two effects, by making use of a sharp episode of locust plague invasion and tracing out how it affected the health of children exposed to it in utero. For that, we rely on the timing and location of locust swarm events that occurred between June and December 2004 in Mali to identify the temporal and spatial variation in the exposure of different cohorts of children to the plague. Data on locust swarm invasions come from the locust monitoring system run by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Desert Locust Information Service (DLIS). Geocoded household survey data with detailed information on the timing of birth and health outcomes of children is taken from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). We also link this data to local agricultural crop price data from the Malian Agricultural Market Observatory (Observatoire du Marche Agricole - OMA) to tease out potential local price effects.====In the first part of our empirical analysis, we start by showing that the plague led to significant inflation of crop prices (average increase of 8.4%) in affected areas, compared to non-affected areas, during the growing season of 2004.==== We take this result as empirical evidence of the speculative price effect in treated markets: during that period, local markets were still relying on the previous harvest that has not been affected by the plague. Therefore, we can infer that the estimated price inflation is caused by the expectations of agents about a potential failure of the upcoming harvest. The magnitude of this price inflation is consistent with the impact of market interventions on crop prices. Gross et al. (2020) show that the random scaling-up of a food security program that buys grain from outside sources and sells it locally in poor and isolated areas of Burkina Faso decreased crop prices by 6% on average. The magnitude of our price inflation is also consistent with the impact of other agricultural shocks such as droughts on crop prices. Kudamatsu et al. (2016) shows for instance that a severe lack of growing-season rainfall raises staple crop prices by 7 to 10% in Sub-Saharan Africa.====We then turn to the core of our analysis and explore the impact of locust invasion on child health. First, using a Difference-in-Differences identification strategy, we show that children exposed in utero to the adverse effects of the plague suffered major health setbacks. They had, on average, a height-for-age Z-score 0.42 points lower than non-exposed children. This represents around 30% of the average height-for-age Z-score. Our estimates suggest an increase in the average stunting rate by more than 20%. We find no impact on cohorts of children exposed to the shock after birth.====In the second part of this analysis, we study the timing of the estimated effect by quarters of birth. Our results show that cohorts of children that were subject only to the ==== in utero suffer as much as those exposed to the actual ====.==== Importantly, we argue that the health effects of the exposure (in utero) to the ==== go beyond the documented local crop price inflation effect for two main reasons. First, it includes (potentially) any precautionary consumption smoothing effect: a decrease in grain consumption driven by households smoothing the impact of the anticipated consumption shock over time. Second, it also captures the impact of in-utero exposure to the stress/anxiety that the news of an imminent shock (harvest failure in our case) can bring to households (Torche, 2011, Talge et al., 2007, Tapsoba, 2023). We are not able to tease out these mechanisms with our data (this is beyond the scope of this paper). We argue nonetheless that the documented significant inflation effect in anticipation of the future crop failure cannot be explained by any of these two alternative mechanisms or by other alternative factors such as increased use of pesticides, a devotion of local resources to controlling the invasion, limited access to health care, etc.==== Moreover, we show that the estimated treatment effect (on child health) of exposure to the ==== is partly absorbed when we account for the price variation.====The extent to which local markets are isolated from other sources of agricultural supply also plays a crucial role in this context. In particular, we find that exposed children born in isolated areas, with limited access to crops from other areas, suffer more compared to those born in well-connected areas. This pattern is driven by the ====. We found no differential effect of treatment by the level of isolation of local markets for children exposed only to the ====.====Our results are robust to specifications that include region-specific time trends, household and mother characteristics, climate shocks, household fixed effects, and mother fixed effects. We also argue that they are not likely to be biased by potential migration, pre-existing differences in trends between treated and non-treated areas, and exposure to anti-locust pesticide spraying. Results are also robust to restricting the analysis to male–female and rural–urban sub-samples.====The distinction between the ==== and the ==== is crucial when we consider how this shock affects time-sensitive health investments such as those that households make when they have children in utero. The anticipation of future negative shocks such as a crop failure at the next harvest may lead to persistent health effects for entire cohorts of children that would otherwise not suffer any detectable effect. The locust plague episode studied in this paper provides a setup that allows us to document this ==== separately from the actual ====. This effect is also potentially present in other types of agricultural shocks such as droughts or floods since agents often form strong beliefs about the next harvest outcome early in the rainy season.==== A common illustration of such behavior is when farmers decide to replant some seeds in the middle of the season hoping to receive the right amount of rainfall for the new crops to produce as well and help limit the damage of the anticipated shock. This legitimate anticipation of potential negative shock may however lead to persistent health consequences for vulnerable household members such as children in utero.====The findings of this paper also have important policy implications. In particular, we provide evidence of the existence of a strong ==== that operates differently than the actual ==== when agricultural shocks such as locust plagues occur. This calls therefore for different types of policy reactions. Fighting the speculative behavior of intermediaries is crucial during the growing season when the overall crop supply on markets is at its lowest level. Conversely, after the harvest period, policy action should focus on coping with the local crop failure shocks. Our findings also suggest that easy and diversified access to agricultural production from non-affected areas can effectively mitigate this effect.",The power of markets: Impact of desert locust invasions on child health,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629622001266,29 November 2022,2022,Research Article,26.0

The reform opened up an additional income channel for physician by allowing them to earn a markup on ,"Economics has a long tradition of studying asymmetric information between market participants and the inefficiencies that might consequently arise. In the health care context, the interaction between physicians and patients has received special attention. Physicians, the rationale goes, are better informed about the spectrum of treatment alternatives and medical technologies (e.g., “wait and see”, surgery, medication) than the patients (e.g., Gottschalk et al., 2020, Johnson, 2014, McGuire, 2011, McGuire, 2000 for surveys of the literature). In an ideal world, physicians would act as “perfect agents” for their patients and simply assist them to demand the quantities of various types of care that patients would have chosen if they had access to the same information and knowledge as the doctors (Pauly, 1980). In the real world, however, physicians need to balance private interests (e.g., income goals) and patient welfare (Ellis and McGuire, 1986). Reimbursement systems that financially reward the quantity of care might therefore distort treatment decisions as some physicians may be willing to trade-off patient benefits for a higher income. Whether physicians actually engage in such behavior ultimately remains an empirical question.====Previous work typically exploits changes in physician fees to analyze the doctors’ responses to financial incentives (e.g., Clemens and Gottlieb, 2014, Jacobson et al., 2010, Gruber et al., 1999, Yip, 1998, Nguyen and Derrick, 1997). The more recent study by Clemens and Gottlieb (2014), for example, examines the consolidation of geographic regions through Medicare in the late 1990s and provides evidence for the presence of substitution effects. Physicians tend to shift quantities from areas that experience fee reductions to services with fee increases to compensate for income losses. Allowing physicians to earn money by selling drugs through their in-house pharmacy to patients – the setting we study in this paper – is equivalent to a fee increase providing an incentive to increase the supply of drugs. Our setting, however, differs from previous studies as physicians may profit from the fee increase even without changing treatment decisions. In case of pharmaceutical prescribing, physicians often face the choice among several product alternatives for a particular diagnosis that provide identical medical benefits to patients but may differ in the financial reward to the physician. To illustrate, consider the high-market share hypertension drug “Amlodipin” which is sold by seven different drug companies. Although the active ingredient is identical between suppliers, the markup differs not only between the brand-name product and the generics but also between generics. Therefore, physicians may increase their income by prescribing more expensive “brands” without sacrificing patient health at all. Engaging in such behavior is a textbook example of rent-seeking behavior: physicians extract a bigger piece of the pie without increasing medical productivity.====In this paper we analyze whether physicians engage in such rent-seeking behavior by exploiting a recent reform in two large Swiss cities. The reform allowed physicians to sell drugs to their patients (through so-called “physician dispensing”) and opened up an additional income channel to them: while only pharmacies earned a markup on drugs before the reform, these markups are now pocketed by the physicians themselves. So even in the absence of behavioral changes, physicians’ earnings are increased by the substitution of markups from pharmacies to physicians. Besides pure substitution, the changes in the incentive structure might also trigger behavioral changes. For one, physicians might choose to prescribe more drugs, potentially sacrificing patient benefits to some extent. This could be both at the extensive (more patients are medicated) or at the intensive margin (patients already treated with medication receive more drugs). On the other hand, they might prescribe more profitable brands without changing the treatment, which would impose additional costs on the patients and the health care system without generating improvements in the treatment quality.====Unlike previous work on drug dispensing (see below), we are able to exploit the variation created by a policy change which allows physicians to dispense drugs. The reform divides patients into a treatment (having a dispensing physician) and a control group (having a non-dispensing physician). All of these patients had a non-dispensing physician prior to the reform. Since dispensing physicians systematically differ in attributes like practice style, adherence to medical guidelines and costs per patient from their non-dispensing counterparts, we dot not base identification on direct group comparisons. Instead, we make use of a special feature in our data: We observe the interaction between patients and physicians both before and after the reform and see the drugs that doctors prescribe to their patients. Specifically, the data offers information on the number of packages, the markups, the costs and the price category of drugs physicians prescribe to the same patients before and after the introduction of dispensing. This data structure has the advantage that we are able to directly address selection biases as we are able to condition on existing physician–patient relationships. For a selection of high market share hypertension and reflux drugs and an antibiotic, we further observe the substance class, the drug brand (e.g., generics or brand-name), the dosage, and the number of pills on each prescription. As a stylized example, suppose Patient A suffers from hypertension and is regularly prescribed the 4-month package (120 pills) of the generic drug “Amlodipin” in the years before the reform. After the reform, Patient A still receives the same active ingredient, but now in the form of two 2-month packages (60 pills) from “Norvasc”, the brand-name drug. Given the current drug price regulation in Switzerland, such a switch is profitable for self-dispensing physicians. For this subset of drugs, we are able to precisely track such changes in physician prescription decisions.====To estimate the effects of dispensing, we apply a two-step procedure that combines balancing with difference-in-difference estimation. Specifically, we use entropy balancing, a preprocessing method similar to nearest neighbor and propensity score matching that enables us to estimate sampling weights from the data that balance the covariate and pre-treatment outcome distributions between patients of dispensing physicians and patients of non-dispensing physicians. In contrast to other preprocessing techniques, entropy balancing has the advantage to directly produce weights that equalize a potentially large set of sample moments between the treatment and control group. Therefore, entropy balancing always (at least weakly) improves on the covariate balance achieved by other preprocessing methods (Hainmueller, 2012, Hainmueller and Xu, 2013). In this paper, we preprocess the data to make the common trends assumption more credible. Based on the re-weighted data, we then estimate difference-in-differences specifications that account for physician–patient interaction fixed effects and a rich set of patient characteristics (e.g., age, comorbidities).====Our paper contributes to the small body of empirical literature that analyzes the influence of drug dispensing regimes on prescription behavior for Taiwan (Liu et al., 2009, Chou et al., 2003), Japan (Iizuka, 2012, Iizuka, 2007), and Switzerland (e.g., Burkhard et al., 2019; Kaiser and Schmid, 2016; Trottmann et al., 2016; Rischatsch, 2014). In general, this literature finds that the dispensing physicians are responsive to markup differentials between generic and brand-name drugs and that dispensing significantly affects drug expenditures. Although closely related, this paper differs in three dimensions from prior work. ====, the majority of previous studies does not attempt to estimate the causal effect of dispensing and instead reports associations between dispensing and prescription outcomes. Previous studies for Switzerland, for example, report a significant association between dispensing and generic substitution (Trottmann et al., 2016; Rischatsch, 2014; Rischatsch et al., 2013). In addition, because the dispensing status of physicians is often not directly observed and has to be imputed the corresponding findings may be biased due to measurement error. ====, previous studies for Switzerland who ask the causal question impose strong identifying assumptions==== and thus the results might be biased due to differences in unobservables. In contrast, we explicitly address selection issues by exploiting the exogenous variation created by the reform. ====, we extend the analysis by analyzing possible channels through which physicians adapt their prescription behavior in response to dispensing.====Our analysis yields four main results: ====, we find that dispensing leads to a significant increase in drug costs of about CHF 20 (＋4%–5%) per patient and year. This finding implies a behavioral response of physicians as we would not observe an effect on total drug costs if physicians simply dispensed the drugs for which they previously wrote prescriptions to be filled at pharmacies. ====, we provide evidence that dispensing results in an increase in physician earnings by approximately CHF 30 per patient. We show that the increase in earnings is composed of a substitution and a rent-seeking component. The latter is the result of a behavioral response and we estimate it to be around one third of the revenue increase. ====, we explore possible channels through which the behavioral response we observe may operate. Our analysis is indicative that two channels drive our main findings: (a) physicians substitute larger with smaller packages because the current price regulation of pharmaceuticals generates higher markups per pill for smaller package sizes. Our analysis is compatible with such a “package size channel” as significantly more packages are prescribed to patients of dispensing physicians, while simultaneously we find no evidence for a dosage change among the same patients; (b) physicians prescribe more profitable drugs to patients (the “cherry-picking channel”) as also documented by Iizuka (2012). ====, we provide evidence for considerable effect heterogeneity. We show that dispensing unilaterally affects the behavior of classic fee-for-service physicians, while HMO physicians do not respond to dispensing. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that dispensing physicians “target” less price sensitive patients with low deductibles as we solely find effects in this patient segment (i.e., no effect for higher deductible groups).====Overall, our analysis provides evidence that profit motives indeed influence the prescription decisions of physicians. However, we do not find evidence for physicians trading-off patient benefits for profits, a result regularly found in the previous agency literature. Instead, our results indicate that physicians act in the patients’ best medical interest – they do not unnecessarily expand medication or alter dosage decisions – but at the same time, at least some of them also do not shy away from “playing the system” and earn some extra dollars. Hence, even if physicians do not seem to be willing to trade in patient health for profit, they engage in rent-seeking behavior leading to wasteful resource use and avoidable costs for the health care system.====Besides the economic relevance of the problem, our findings are also relevant for policy makers. Drug expenditures amount to about 15%–20% of total health care spending across the OECD in 2017. Switzerland and the US and have the highest drug expenditures per capita in the world with more than $1000 (OECD, 2018). In light of this, the question arises whether it is a smart idea to expose physicians to additional monetary incentives. This paper gives a clear answer. Efficiency gains can be achieved by eliminating the counterproductive financial incentives introduced by dispensing. Whether these low-hanging fruits are “harvested” lies in the hands of policy makers.",Rents for Pills: Financial incentives and physician behavior,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629622001254,23 November 2022,2022,Research Article,27.0

We use geo-referenced data for non-migrating mothers from 46 developing countries and a total of 128 ,"Does economic growth lead to better child health in developing countries? While there is evidence of a positive correlation between economic prosperity and health status for adults in developed countries (Adler et al., 1994, Ettner, 1996, Adams et al., 2003), it is less clear that such a relationship exists for infants and small children in developing countries and, if it exists, what the causal effect of economic well-being on health status is. Recent evidence suggests that the relationship between GDP per capita and early childhood height-for-age z-scores, or rather underweight, may be weak to non-existent (Vollmer et al., 2014). In contrast, Aiyar and Cummins (2021) argue that a moderate effect of growth on height-for-age exists, which materializes only over time peaking at age 3 as better-off children grow faster.====Even if a positive correlation between economic growth and health status exists, its interpretation is plagued with reverse causality issues – better economic conditions create better health outcomes through better health care, more nutritious diets, and better health-related knowledge, especially the socioeconomic status of parents matters for children (Currie, 2009, Almond et al., 2018). But then better health increases human capital accumulation, labor productivity and thus economic outcomes (Alderman and Behrman, 2006, Cole and Neumayer, 2006, Mary, 2018, Miguel and Kremer, 2004, Weil, 2007). In short, the relationship between health and growth is far from settled. Moreover, most analyses use aggregate – national – data for economic activity levels such as GDP per capita; yet growth is a very localized phenomenon with large regional variations within countries (Asher et al., 2021). Especially, access to health personnel and health facilities such as midwifes, doctors, health posts and clinics is very localized and therefore a localized analysis is called for.====We make the following contributions to the debate on this intricate relationship: First, we provide a localized analysis. We use geo-referenced data of non-migrating mothers to relate the probability of neonatal and infant death of their children to nighttime luminosity (NTL) in that location and a range of socioeconomic and household characteristics as control variables. Second, we create a panel of births and infant deaths of all stationary mothers. We use data from 128 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) for 46 countries for the period 1992–2013. Although DHS data are cross-sectional, mothers are asked for their complete history of child births and child deaths. That allows us to create a panel and to relate the probability of infant death to the economic conditions at the time of birth in that location. By restricting our sample to non-migrating mothers and by using mother fixed effects we address the problem of unobserved characteristics of the mother (genetic disposition, health-relevant habits and culture etc.) and time-invariant location characteristics such as terrain characteristics, freshwater availability etc., and focus on the influence of time-variant drivers of health related to growth.====Third, we seek to investigate the causal effect of changes in NTL on the probability of infant death for the ==== mother in the ==== location. This avoids sorting effects and controls for all location-specific and mother-specific time-invariant characteristics. Our identifying assumption is that after controlling for mother fixed effects and a battery of time-variant variables at the child, mother, household, location and national level such as mother’s age, gender of the child, conflict or polity2 scores there is no omitted factor affecting child health that is correlated with the level of economic activity at the local level.====Improvements in child health could be correlated with improvements in adult health, which in turn could cause an increase in economic activity leading to reverse causality issues. It may seem unlikely that changes in adult health result in changes in economic activity in the very short run (in less than a year) and thus reverse causality issues may be of lesser concern in our context. However, we cannot completely rule out that possibility. To address this issue, at least partially, we use lagged explanatory variables and use neonatal mortality (i.e. death within the first month of a child’s life) as a second endogenous variable, which should be much more sensitive to economic growth than adult mortality.====Our analysis is individual and local. We agree with Vollmer et al. (2014, p.e225) and Aiyar and Cummins (2021) that changes in economic activity cannot be assumed to affect all individuals alike; like Vollmer et al. (2014) and Aiyar and Cummins (2021) we use data on ==== rather than aggregate health measures. Yet, both contributions – and many more – use GDP per capita as the relevant proxy for the level of economic activity. This assumes that (the change in) ==== economic activity, as measured by GDP per capita, is the relevant measure for analyzing the growth–health nexus. In the light of the strong evidence of interregional disparities (e.g. in child undernutrition or in living standards, Khan and Mohanty, 2018, Asher et al., 2021) an analysis of growth effects at the national level may not fully account for the underlying heterogeneity of local growth processes. Moreover, the new economic geography approach (Krugman, 1995, Fujita and Thisse, 2002) provides the theoretical underpinnings for large interregional disparities. If economic activity across regions is not uniform, neither in theory nor in practice, the use of aggregate measures of economic activity can lead to biased estimates of the effect of growth on individual health. The same logic that suggest that the use of individual health data is superior to the use of aggregate health measures (Vollmer et al., 2014 p.e225 ) implies that the use of local measures for economic activity is superior to the use of aggregate measures such as GDP per capita. Therefore, we use nighttime luminosity at the grid level as local measure of economic activity.====Subramanyam et al. (2011) follow this logic and use state GDP data to estimate the effect of economic growth on child health in India. They find no consistent evidence that economic growth at the state level causes improvements in child health. Even though this analysis uses subnational data, it is not a local analysis such as ours at the grid level as Indian states are quite large and diverse. Amare et al. (2020) is the only other study we are aware of that relates health outcomes to NTL. They use individual child nutritional data from two different DHS rounds in Nigeria only. Since their data have no panel structure but are repeated cross-sections, they are unable to control for unobserved heterogeneity and cannot identify a causal effect of NTL on health outcomes.====NTL data have been shown to be a good proxy for economic activity (e.g., Chen and Nordhaus, 2011, Doll et al., 2006, Henderson et al., 2012, Sutton et al., 2007); they have been used for explaining a range of development issues such as the role of pre-colonial ethnic institutions for comparative regional development (Michalopoulos and Papaioannou, 2013), ethnic inequality (Alesina et al., 2016), regional favoritism (De Luca et al., 2018, Hodler and Raschky, 2014b), or microfinance (Brown et al., 2016). Even though it is not entirely clear what exactly NTL is a proxy for (Asher et al., 2021), there seems to be a consensus that NTL is a good proxy for economic development in a broad sense.====We find that higher NTL reduces the likelihood of infant death significantly: a two-unit increase in NTL, which is equal to the average 10-year increase in NTL in our sample locations, reduces the probability of infant death by 0.11 percentage points, equivalent to 1.7% percent of the mean probability of infant deaths in our sample of 6.6%.====Our analysis speaks to the wider literature on health and growth.==== Panel studies at the country level, such as Pritchett and Summers (1996), Easterly (1999), Smith and Haddad (2002) or Headey (2013) estimate the correlation of aggregated output variables (mostly GDP per capita) and aggregated health outcomes at the country level. They show that wealthier countries tend to have healthier populations and that economic growth is associated with average health improvements. While being informative, these studies focus on average effects and disregard individual and regional heterogeneity.====A second strand of the literature relates individual health outcomes to individual characteristics and aggregate economic outcomes (e.g., Paxson and Schady, 2005, Boyle et al., 2006, Harttgen et al., 2013, Vollmer et al., 2014, Baird et al., 2011). Even though these studies use individual health data, they use country averages for the variable measuring economic activity, which may lead to biased estimates.====Third, micro-level studies use personal or household income to explain individual health outcomes (e.g. Case et al., 2002, Currie and Stabile, 2003), but they disregard changes in environmental variables. Yet, these are crucial for the growth–health nexus. Individual pollution exposure does not depend on individual household income, but on the level of economic activity around the place of residence; access to piped water depends predominantly on the water infrastructure in a locality, access to health care on the local health facilities (health posts, clinics etc.). Empirical evidence supports this argument. Weil (2014) shows that health improvements in the last centuries can be attributed to the public health environment. This includes access to clean water, appropriate sanitation or medical technology in health facilities. Using DHS data for Tanzania – and after controlling for individual wealth – Khan et al. (2005) find that living in a poor neighborhood is associated with worse health outcomes and lower service utilization rates. Li et al. (2012) examine the relationship between urbanization and human health in China using nighttime luminosity data and find that higher levels of urbanization are linked to higher rates of chronic diseases. Bruederle and Hodler (2018) demonstrate that nighttime lights can serve as a proxy for human development at the local level. Their analysis uses environmental variables for survey locations and human development variables are aggregated at the location level; thus they disregard individual characteristics and thereby individual heterogeneity. Their analysis provides interesting correlations, but cannot establish causality; for instance it is possible that healthier people cluster in regions of higher economic growth and thus the estimated effect of growth on health may be biased. We complement their analysis by focusing on mothers that did not move and explain variations in mortality of children ==== by variations in local economic activity.====The paper that is closest to our approach is Baird et al. (2011) who analyze the effects of income shocks – measured as deviations from the trend – on child mortality. Yet, they use the national GDP per capita as relevant measure of economic development, which may be suboptimal for the reasons described above. Like most studies in this strand of the literature they do not completely address the issue of reverse causality as deviations of GDP per capita from the trend can, at least in principle, be brought about by changes in health status of the population. For instance an outbreak of an infectious disease may lead to negative deviations from the trend in GDP per capita, which in turn could affect the health status of children.====The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the dataset, defines all variables used, explains how the average nighttime lights were derived and discusses how well NTL proxies economic development. Section 3 illustrates the empirical approach. Section 4 presents the main findings on infant mortality. Section 5 contains extensions and robustness checks: we first show correlations of contemporaneous health measures for children (underweight, stunting, anemia etc.) with economic development, then analyze heterogeneous effects and subsequently present robustness analyses with respect to possible recall biases, different functional forms, different radii for the relevant NTL area, survey weights and the inclusion of GDP per capita.

These effects have been comprehensively reviewed by Almond and Currie (2011), Almond et al. (2018), Currie and Almond (2011), Currie and Vogl (2013), and Heckman, 2006. In contrast to the large body of literature on the effect on the individual of experiencing early childhood health shocks (ECHS), evidence on whether such effects could spill over to others is relatively limited. Most such studies focus on spillovers on outcomes for family members; for example, how ECHS could affect parents (Burton et al., 2008; Corcnan et al., 2005; Deshpande, 2016; Gunnsteinsson and Steingrimsdottir, 2019; Kvist et al., 2013; Powers, 2003;) and siblings (Black et al., 2021; Breining 2014; Daysal et al., 2022). Relatively little is known regarding whether the effect of ECHS could spill over to individuals outside the family, such as peers at school.====This study aims to fill this gap in the literature by examining whether experiencing health shocks before primary school could affect the outcomes of the individuals’ middle school classmates. We use nationally representative data on China in which schools randomly assign students to classrooms at the beginning of grade 7 (the first year of middle school), and no reassignments are made in grade 8 or 9.====We find strong spillover effects of ECHS on social-emotional outcomes in the middle school classroom. Students who were assigned to classes in which more classmates had ECHS are more likely to experience emotional distress, worse social acclimation with classmates, and less engagement in school activities. However, we do not find statistically significant effects on test scores.====This paper further investigates the mechanisms of the externalities. Existing literature suggests that experiencing ECHS could affect one's own social-emotional outcomes in later life (Deindl, 2013; Helliwell and Wang, 2013; Layard et al., 2013; Reulbach et al., 2010; Stafford et al., 2015). This finding is also supported by our data, which show that students with ECHS tend to have lower social-emotional outcomes; they are more likely to present negative emotions and less likely to engage in social activities at school. We find that students with ECHS may have unintentionally created a negative classroom environment. Students assigned to classrooms in which more classmates had ECHS are more likely to report that their classroom atmosphere is not good, their classmates are not friendly, they dislike their classmates, and want to transfer to another school. It is likely, therefore, that the deteriorated classroom atmosphere caused by students with ECHS damages the social-emotional outcomes of students without ECHS. This finding supports recent work by Daysal et al. (2022) in Denmark, who use a regression discontinuity design to find that being qualified to receive free medical treatment for low-birth-weight babies benefits those babies’ siblings, which in turn causes their siblings to have higher test scores in the long run. Their analysis also suggests that the reduced mental stress and improved interactions among family members is behind the positive spillover effects of receiving medical treatment in early life.====We further investigate another potential operating channel that is common among peer effect studies in school: whether the externalities operate by affecting teachers’ behaviors or preferences. We examine 20 variables related to teachers’ outcomes, such as attitude towards the job, time spent on work, and teaching methods. We find no evidence that teachers’ outcomes are altered by the proportion of students with ECHS in the class, which suggests that such an operating channel is unlikely.====We further provide novel evidence that better interactions at home may help to mitigate negative peer effects at school. Children of parents who actively encourage their children to discuss their interactions at school, concerns, or relationships with friends are less affected by negative externalities. This finding suggests that parents may have the potential to either directly reduce the influence of negative peers on their children or equip their children indirectly with the skills to do so.====There could be concern that the negative externalities of classmates’ health shocks before primary school could be driven by classmates’ family background characteristics. To address this concern, we control for a set of detailed classmates’ family background characteristics, including classmates’ family wealth level before primary school. Another concern is that an individual's past health condition could be correlated with the individual's current health condition, and therefore it could be that the classmate's current health condition drives the results rather than a past condition. To address this concern, we further control for a detailed set of classmates’ current health conditions. All of our results remain robust.====Our study uses the China Education Panel Study (CEPS), a nationally representative survey of middle school students in China, in which the majority of schools randomly assign students to a classroom. The random classroom assignment feature in the CEPS is documented in multiple studies and many have utilized this feature to estimate classroom compositional effects on students’ outcomes (e.g. Gong et al., 2021; Hill and Zhou, 2021; Huang and Zhu, 2020; Xu et al., 2022). The CEPS provides detailed information on students’ social-emotional outcomes and captures a full picture of the classroom environment. Once a classroom is selected for the CEPS sample, every student in the classroom and their parents are surveyed. We focus on middle school, which is when most social-emotional outcomes are shaped and thought to develop.====The percentage of students with ECHS is measured with a survey item—whether a student had a serious disease before primary school—that is asked of both parents (in the parent survey) and students (in the student survey). We find that both the parent-reported measure and the student-reported measure generate similar results.====Our analysis first contributes to the recent literature that documents the spillover effects of ECHS. The majority of studies in this area focus on the spillover effects on parental socioeconomic outcomes, such as parental labor supply (Breivik and Costa-Ramón, 2022; Deshpande, 2016; Gunnsteinsson and Steingrimsdottir, 2019; Powers, 2003); maternal health (Burton et al., 2008); and marriage stability (Kvist et al., 2013; Reichman et al., 2004). Several studies also show that ECHS could have an impact on siblings’ academic outcomes (Black et al., 2021; Breining 2014; Daysal et al., 2022). For instance, Black et al. (2021) find spillover effects of ECHS on siblings’ academic outcomes in both Florida and Denmark. They employ exogenous variation in birth order and explore differential effects on siblings who spend different amounts of time with the disabled sibling as a result of birth order. Daysal et al. (2022) explore differences in the medical treatment provided to babies whose birth weight is just above the very low birth weight cutoff and to those who are just below the cutoff. They find that siblings of the babies who received free medical treatment also benefit from the treatment by having higher test scores in the long run. Outside of family members, the empirical evidence is very limited. Gazze et al. (2020) would be the closest to ours; they find that having more classmates who have been exposed to lead during early childhood is associated with lower academic outcomes in both the short and long term. Our study provides new evidence on this relatively understudied area and suggests that the spillover effects of ECHS are not limited to academic outcomes and are likely to extend to social-emotional outcomes.====Our findings on social-emotional outcomes among middle school students have important implications. Emotional distress during adolescence is directly linked to mental health issues in adulthood (Johnson et al., 2009). A sense of belonging and acceptance at school is crucial for adolescents’ sense of self-worth and overall life satisfaction (Juvonen, 2006). The absence of a feeling of connectedness at school could not only cause emotional distress among students but also discourage students from pursuing further education (OECD, 2017; Shochet et al., 2006).====This paper is also closely related to the body of literature on peer compositional effects (see the review in Sacerdote (2011) and Bramoullé et al. (2020)). The paper contributes to the peer effect literature by examining the externality of ECHS—an understudied source of externality—and focuses on the impact on peers’ social-emotional outcomes; empirical studies in this area are limited and evidence is mixed (Aizer, 2008; Eisenberg et al., 2013; Horoi and Ost, 2015). An important feature that distinguishes our paper from much of the peer effect literature is that we provide some of the first evidence that children with parents who are more communicative and invest more time in their children are less affected by negative classmate influences. This is an important contribution relative to prior studies, because it suggests that parents have the potential to mitigate negative peer effects.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We describe the data used in our analysis in Section 2, discuss our identification strategies in Section 3, and present the empirical results of our analysis in Section 4. We investigate the mechanisms in Section 5, discuss heterogeneity and potential mitigating factors in Section 6, and conclude in Section 7.","Early childhood health shocks, classroom environment, and social-emotional outcomes",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629622001138,2 November 2022,2022,Research Article,30.0

Recent evidence has also shown that the stress a mother faces during pregnancy (Aizer et al., 2016; Persson and Rossin-Slater, 2018) or the level of stress in the household environment (Shonkoff et al., 2012; Masarik and Congers, 2017) can also affect child health and other socioeconomic outcomes. Furthermore, the effects of stress on health are inversely related to socioeconomic status (Aizer et al., 2016). However, the role of the public transfer system in potentially reducing stress has not been studied extensively (Currie and Rossin-Slater, 2015). In this paper, we explore whether the pregnancy-related Medicaid expansions in the late 1980s affected child and maternal outcomes, including mental and developmental health. We hypothesize that access to and use of health insurance in the period spanning pregnancy to early childhood may improve individual outcomes either directly, through use of health care, or indirectly by reducing the stress a mother experiences. Existing research provides evidence that greater access to health insurance increases health care use, but the relationship to improved health outcomes is often weaker, and stress-related outcomes are less studied.====Much of the initial research examining the effects of the 1980s pregnancy-related Medicaid expansions on infant outcomes around the time of birth suggests that while the expansions appear to have increased prenatal care, they had limited influence on health at birth except for the earliest expansions which affected the most resource-constrained families (Currie and Gruber, 1996b; Howell, 2001).==== However, recent analysis uncovers a strong improvement in adult health and educational outcomes for the affected children (Miller and Wherry, 2019), a pattern that is evident for other child-related expansions of Medicaid (Currie et al., 2008; Cohodes et al., 2016; Thompson, 2017; Brown et al., 2020; and Groves, 2020) as well as the introduction of Medicaid (Boudreaux et al., 2016; and Goodman-Bacon 2018, 2021).==== Studying the post-birth and early childhood effects of the expansion, as we do, could shed light on the additional mechanisms underlying the improvement in the affected children's adult outcomes. In particular, the contemporaneous effects of the expansion on the mothers themselves during the post-birth period, an understudied area, could augment our understanding of the longer-term effects of the expansion and help determine whether they work in part through the family environment. We use survey and administrative data to examine the effects of the pregnancy-related Medicaid expansions on child and maternal outcomes in the short- and longer-term (approximately 3 years post-birth).====One challenge when studying the effect of insurance on a health outcome of interest is that carrying health insurance is correlated with other factors (income, employment) that may also be correlated with health. In this study we are able to provide estimates that are plausibly causal since we use cross-state variation generated by the late 1980s pregnancy-related Medicaid eligibility expansions, which increased access to publicly funded medical care for a large number of women, many of whom would not have been able to afford medical care around the time of pregnancy without these expansions. We construct pregnancy-related Medicaid income threshold measures by state and month, beginning in 1987 using information provided by Hill (1992). As we show in Fig. 1, the average pregnancy-related Medicaid threshold measured in terms of the Federal Poverty Guideline (FPG) in the United States increased quickly over this period. In fact, changes in 1988 reflect a near doubling of the eligible population of women of childbearing age eligible for Medicaid in the event of pregnancy in states that expanded.====We combine these policy data with rich survey and administrative data from the National Maternal and Infant Health Survey (NMIHS), which is a large sample of births that occurred in 1988. The ideal timing of this sample relative to the policy changes at the state level allows us to assess the effects of state-varying Medicaid income limits on outcomes at birth or even before birth, including utilization of prenatal care, whether the birth is funded by Medicaid, at-birth infant health outcomes, at-birth maternal health outcomes, and several first-year outcomes (including readmission, infant death, and mother's depression score). Next, we examine whether these expansions had ongoing consequences for child health and developmental outcomes as well as maternal behavior and mental health. Specifically, the NMIHS 1991 follow-up enables us to examine outcomes approximately three years later, including child development and mother's depression scores.====The rich nature of the NMIHS alongside the frequent policy changes in this time period enable us to explore both the average effects (intention-to-treat) of expansion, which is the approach taken by the prior literature, as well as the connection between income eligibility thresholds and participation itself, since the NMIHS, unlike many other data sources, indicates whether the individual received Medicaid and for how long. While prior work has examined the impact of Medicaid expansions on birth outcomes, no research we are aware of has examined early childhood health effects of these expansions, and certainly no study has utilized a data set with the comprehensive set of maternal, infant, and provider information contained in the 1988 and 1991 NMIHS. We also believe this is the first paper to examine the effects of pregnancy Medicaid access on the child's and mother's physical and mental health and development during the child's early years.====Our estimates suggest that the expansion of Medicaid eligibility leads to earlier initiation of prenatal care, but this does not appear to translate into substantial health gains for most of our at-birth outcomes. Taken together our estimates are quite similar to the balance of prior evidence on the effects of the expansion on prenatal and birth outcomes. Examining our post-birth outcomes (through age 3), we find little evidence of an improvement in child physical health but some increase in a measure of child development. We also find that reported maternal depression both during infancy and around three years post birth is likely to be lower when the mother experienced more generous Medicaid eligibility. Additionally, these policies appear more salient for less educated and unmarried mothers.====According to the medical literature (discussed further below), one possible source of depression during pregnancy is stress.==== Our estimates suggest that increasing access to publicly funded health insurance may be alleviating maternal stress around the time of birth and into early childhood, which we suggest is also a likely mechanism for the longer term improvements in the treated children's adult outcomes found in the literature. Since we focus on a population that may experience greater than average benefits from a reduction in stress, our estimates are particularly relevant for policies focusing on the low income population.","The effects of pregnancy-related Medicaid expansions on maternal, infant, and child health",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629622001102,31 October 2022,2022,Research Article,31.0

Soil Zn deficiency limits both crop yields and the Zn concentration in food crops, leading many to speculate that it underlies human Zn deficiency and child stunting, globally and particularly in South Asia. We find strong evidence that soil Zn deficiency does have a causal impact on child stunting in Nepal’s Tarai region, the breadbasket of the country. Using causal bounds, we find that a 1 part per million increase in plant-available soil Zn – achievable with application of Zn-enriched fertilizer – decreases child stunting by between 1 and 7.5 percentage points. Multiple statistical sensitivity tests indicate that this relationship is unlikely to be manufactured by omitted, relevant variables.","Within an expansive economics literature on health and the environment,==== little attention has been paid to regional disease ecologies — likely because spatial endogeneity hampers causal identification of their effects (Acemoglu and Johnson, 2007, Bloom et al., 2014, Acemoglu and Johnson, 2014, Bonds et al., 2012). Yet spatially-determined epidemiological conditions may, over decades or centuries, help to shape the intertwined health and economic development of societies (Bonds et al., 2010). For instance, malaria intensity predicts national income and economic growth (Sachs, 2001, Gallup and Sachs, 2001).==== Ultra-violet radiation intensity predicts economic activity both within and across countries, and may work through influencing disease ecology and work-life expectancy (Andersen et al., 2016). Lead exposure impacts infant mortality, scholastic performance and labor market outcomes, adolescent behavior, and perhaps crime rates (Clay et al., 2014, Billings and Schnepel, 2018, Reyes, 2007, Nilsson, 2009, Feigenbaum and Muller, 2016). Soil-transmitted helminth parasite infection influences child morbidity, with further impacts on cognitive function and educational outcomes in some contexts (Nokes et al., 1992, Grigorenko et al., 2006, Miguel and Kremer, 2004, Aiken et al., 2015, Taylor-Robinson and Garner, 2017).====In this paper, we explore the health impacts of soil zinc (Zn) deficiency, which may drive human Zn deficiency in many regions of the developing world. Zn is an essential trace element in human nutrition; Zn deficiency slows physical growth, impairs cognition and learning, delays wound healing, and in many contexts drives diarrhea, infectious disease, and anemia (Wessells and Brown, 2012, Black et al., 2013, Roohani et al., 2013). Globally, Zn deficiency drives more deaths per year than any other micronutrient deficiency except vitamin A deficiency, and Zn supplementation is one of the most impactful interventions for reducing child mortality (Bhutta et al., 2013, Galetti, 2019). Yet the global burden of Zn deficiency is in a sense misleading, because incidence of Zn deficiency is highly spatial. While 17% of the global population appears at risk of inadequate dietary Zn intake, national and sub-national biomarkers surveys suggest that Zn deficiency commonly ranges from 20%–50% in South Asia, the most affected region of the world (Akhtar, 2013, MoHP, 2018, MoHFW, 2019, MoNHS, 2019).====We examine the relationship between soil Zn deficiency and child nutritional status in the context of the Tarai — the low, flat breadbasket of Nepal bordering India. Scientists have long theorized that regional concentrations of human Zn deficiency are driven by Zn deficiency in agricultural soils, since soil Zn deficiency impedes both crop yields and crop Zn concentration, possibly reducing dietary Zn intake for populations dependent on those crops (Çakmak et al., 1999, Shivay et al., 2008b, Cakmak and Hoffland, 2012). Yet only scattered, correlational evidence, generally from very small studies, documents an empirical connection between soil Zn deficiency and human Zn status or health.====While we do not observe human Zn status in Nepal, we do observe child height, which is considered the best ==== proxy for human Zn status (Hotz and Brown, 2004, Wessells and Brown, 2012). A long list of trials and meta-analyses have found that Zn supplementation increases child growth.==== In fact, child stunting rates may proxy for true Zn deficiency rates just as well as prevalence of low blood serum/plasma Zn concentration (Fischer Walker and Black, 2007, Gibson et al., 2008), on which more in Section 2. We therefore pair three waves of Nepal’s Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data – containing child morbidity and anthropometrics, and cluster-level GPS coordinates – with extremely high-resolution soil data for Nepal’s Tarai. These soil data take two forms. First, we use soil maps produced by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) and based on over ten thousand soil samples collected by the government.==== Second, we use the raw soil sample data itself.====We proceed in two parts. First, we show that soil Zn availability is a strong predictor of child stature in the Tarai, according to both soil data products. While the association is not causal, it does not appear to be driven by exogenous, correlated spatial or topographical factors such as elevation, slope, distance to rivers, temperatures, rainfall, etc. Oster’s (2019) causal bounds suggest that a 1 ppm increase in available soil Zn increases child height-for-age z-score by somewhere within 4%–25% of a standard deviation, and decreases child stunting by 1–7.5 percentage points (a 2–21 percent decrease vis-à-vis the mean). Slightly stronger assumptions find bounds even further from zero. Second, we consider the relative importance of three mechanisms: the impact of soil Zn availability on household crop yields (and thus income and food access), on local crop Zn concentration (and thus dietary Zn intake) and on historical community wealth and health (since soil Zn is fairly static over time). While we lack the data to test these pathways definitively, evidence suggests that all three mechanisms may play a role.====We make three contributions. First, by showing that soil Zn deficiency may plausibly drive child stunting in Nepal, we add to the literature on determinants of child malnutrition, and to the scarce and primarily older literature on regional disease ecologies and health (Gallup and Sachs, 2001, Acemoglu and Johnson, 2007, Andersen et al., 2016, Billings and Schnepel, 2018). This finding is also important for nutrition mapping and policy, given that one-third of agricultural soils are low in Zn globally, and perhaps half in South Asia (Alloway, 2004, Cakmak, 2008). Because soil Zn deficiency influences dietary Zn intake only when markets are segmented, our findings also contribute to literature exploring the impacts of market access on diets and nutrition in poor contexts (Stifel and Minten, 2017, Headey et al., 2019).====Second, we illustrate the use of statistical sensitivity tests for gauging the possible causality of imperfectly identified treatment effects; these tests are particularly useful when examining spatially-varying treatments. We use the causal bounds innovated by Oster (2019), as well as the sensitivity tests proposed by Imbens (2003) and Harada (2013). We also use a novel, linear adaptation of the Altonji et al. (2005b) test.====Third, building on Bound and Krueger (1991), we show that the functional form of non-classical measurement error in gridded or spatially interpolated treatment variables dictates the direction and magnitude of resulting bias in the estimated treatment effect. This bias can be substantial. We demonstrate that in some cases (and in our case) the ==== bias in treatment effects estimated using ==== data, combined with ==== bias in treatment effects estimated using ==== data, can be used to bound the treatment effect that would be estimated using non-errored data. In proposing this solution we join Alix-Garcia and Millimet (2022), who offer a solution for confronting non-classical measurement error in remotely sensed, binary independent variables.====These results are timely given the active discussion in both Nepal and India around soil Zn deficiency, Zn-enriched fertilizer, and human Zn deficiency. Indian soil scientists have long recognized that soil Zn deficiency impedes not only crop yields but also crop Zn concentration across the country (Singh et al., 1983, Shivay et al., 2008a, Shukla et al., 2018). Simultaneously, human Zn deficiency is widespread in India and in South Asia generally (Wessells and Brown, 2012, Black et al., 2013). Connecting these dots, Indian scientists have been calling for Zn-enriched fertilizers for the sake of improved agricultural productivity and also improved human nutrition (Cakmak, 2009, Shukla and Behera, 2012, Shukla and Behra, 2019).====Likewise, Nepal’s Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development (MOALD) is considering subsidies for trace mineral-enriched fertilizer, since soil deficiencies in Zn, boron, and other trace minerals are known to limit domestic agricultural productivity (Singh and Thapa, 2012, Gupta, 2017, Andersen, 2007, Srivastava et al., 2005). This policy could influence human nutrition – as observed with selenium-enriched fertilizers in Finland – but such effects have thus far largely been ignored. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that subsidizing Zn-enriched fertilizer throughout the Tarai would be more costly than a comparable food fortification program (on which more below). However, if the goal of enriched fertilizer is merely to increase crop yields, the positive externalities for nutrition may be substantial, and are therefore worth quantifying.====This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides background on the implications of soil Zn availability for crop yields, crop Zn concentration, and human Zn status and stature. Section 3 reviews the datasets and spatial data products used in this paper. Section 4 explains our empirical strategy and the sensitivity tests we use to gauge plausible causality.

Our findings support the need for community benefit spending to be considered, along with quality, efficiency, and prices, when evaluating the welfare impact of acquisitions.","Independent community hospitals are increasingly rare. Reimbursement policies, value-based payment reforms, and an emphasis on health system integration have made hospital system membership more attractive because it has become increasingly difficult for independent hospitals to survive on their own (Postma and Roos, 2016). Demand for inpatient services has consistently declined, resulting in excess inpatient capacity and occupancy rates averaging 64% in 2019 (Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MeDPAC), 2021). In this context, there has been a dramatic rise in hospital consolidation. In 2018, there were 90 announced hospital and health system consolidations in which 57% constituted a not-for-profit hospital or hospital system acquiring another not-for-profit hospital (Kaufman Hall, 2018). By one benchmark, around 90% of metropolitan areas are now considered to have a highly concentrated hospital market defined as an HHI over 0.25 (Fulton, 2017). Many major cities including Boston, San Francisco, and Pittsburgh are now dominated by only a few health care systems (Gaynor and Ginsburg, 2017). Moreover, the pace of hospital consolidation is expected to accelerate with the COVID-19 pandemic placing additional fiscal pressure on independent hospitals (Healthcare Dive, 2021). Although there is a large body of evidence documenting the relationship between hospital consolidation and profit margins, prices, and quality, there is limited knowledge of the impact of non-profit hospital acquisitions on community benefit spending.====Community benefit spending by not-for-profit hospitals has been identified as a way to fund population health improvement activities since the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) required not-for-profit hospitals to conduct triennial community health needs assessments (Institute of Medicine, 2011). Though investments in population health have been linked to better health outcomes, the resources available for investment in population health improvement have been sparse, especially when compared to clinical care (Bradley et al., 2016; Mays et al., 2016). The ACA intended to increase investments and prioritize population health concerns that were traditionally the purview of local public health departments and other organizations. Despite population health activities representing only 5% of total community benefit spending (Young et al., 2013), the expected role of hospitals has evolved from a focus on providing access to clinical treatments within the walls of the organization to addressing the systemic and underlying health concerns of the community, including housing, food security, and education (Rosenbaum, 2016).====Hospital community benefit spending encompasses a broad spectrum of spending that the federal government deems as “beneficial to the community”. Since 2009, the IRS has required not-for-profit hospitals to document the amount and type of community benefit spending on the Form 990 Schedule H. Categories include financial assistance, such as charity care or uncompensated care, losses to Medicaid patients, community/population health improvement activities, health professions education, subsidized health services, research, and cash and in-kind contributions. In 2009, not-for-profit hospitals reported a total of 52.2 billion dollar investment in community benefits (Leider et al., 2017). However, the amount of community benefit spending has varied widely, with the bottom decile of hospitals spending 1% of operating expenses and the top decile spending 20% (Leider et al., 2017; Young et al., 2013). Low spending by some not-for-profit hospitals has raised concerns that some hospitals are not providing enough community benefits to justify their tax-exemption. An analysis by Bai and colleagues found that not-for-profit hospitals spend less on charity care compared to government and for-profit hospitals (Bai et al., 2021). Yet, neither the federal government nor most states have implemented minimum spending thresholds (Johnson et al., 2019).====There is limited evidence that multihospital systems have different priorities than independent hospitals. Alexander and colleagues showed that system affiliation was associated with less community benefit spending from 1989 to 2003 (Alexander et al., 2009). They focused solely on cross-sectional differences between system-affiliated and independent hospitals. In contrast, we examined changes before and after an acquisition, which leads to changes in leadership, mission, and priorities of the hospital. These organizational changes will influence community benefit spending decisions to reflect the priorities of new ownership. The findings by Alexander and colleagues are suggestive of an effect of system acquisitions on community benefit spending decisions, but to our knowledge there are no other studies that specifically evaluate the impact of not-for-profit acquisitions on community benefit spending. We aim to fill this gap by testing whether community benefit spending is affected by system acquisitions in which the acquired hospital continues to operate as a freestanding not-for-profit facility within a not-for-profit multihospital system. We do not pursue the normative question of whether acquisitions improve social welfare. Instead, we document the extent community benefit spending is affected by a change in ownership because it is an important avenue by which hospitals can improve community health and thereby improve societal welfare. Accordingly, it should be considered when evaluating the normative implications of hospital acquisitions, along with price, efficiency, and quality considerations. In fact, our findings support the need for community benefit spending to be considered, along with quality, efficiency, and prices of traditional hospital services, when evaluating the welfare impact of acquisitions.",Understanding the relationship between nonprofit hospital community benefit spending and system membership: An analysis of independent hospital acquisitions,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629622001114,25 October 2022,2022,Research Article,36.0

Health-worker absenteeism is common (Chaudhury et al., 2006), and even when workers are present, the quality of care they provide is often low due to lack of knowledge, failure to impart critical information, or low effort (Das and Hammer, 2005, Das et al., 2008, Das and Hammer, 2014). In addition, surveys routinely find that many health facilities, including hospitals, lack an adequate supply of drugs, equipment, and infrastructure.==== However, there is less evidence on whether this limited quality of care at health facilities affects health outcomes.====This paper measures the effect of hospital-care quality on early child health in Kenya. We identify the effects of healthcare quality on child outcomes by using variation in the timing and location of health-worker strikes in Kenyan hospitals. In data we collected from a broad set of media reports, we identify 23 health-worker strikes spanning 7 counties and 12 different hospitals from 1999 to early 2014.==== The hospitals where strikes occur are typically large national or district-level referral hospitals. Although these hospitals often fall short of international standards for supplies, personnel, and training, they are generally among the best equipped to treat high-risk patients relative to other hospitals and health facilities in the country (Murphy et al., 2018, English et al., 2004).====Children face the highest risk of mortality in the neonatal period (the first 28 days of life), and they are particularly vulnerable within the first few days of life (Zupan and Aahman, 2005, Lawn et al., 2005). The most common causes of early child mortality include prematurity or low birth weight, severe infection, and asphyxiation (Lawn et al., 2005). While these and other common perinatal and neonatal complications are highly treatable, even very short-term delays in receiving appropriate care can lead to drastically increased chances of death or long-term morbidity (Lawn et al., 2009, Baqui et al., 2009, Simmons et al., 2010). In Kenya, it is estimated that approximately 18 percent of all newborns will develop complications that require inpatient neonatal services (Murphy et al., 2017).====Nearly three-quarters of strikes feature either doctors or nurses, but not both, and therefore often result in major staffing shortages but not always a hospital closure. The average strike lasts 7 days. As we document with media reports, vulnerable neonates receive reduced services during strikes for at least three possible reasons: (a) the care provided in a striking hospital that has remained open is worse due to severely limited staff, (b) the child instead receives care in a nearby facility that is either lower quality or whose quality suffers due to overcrowding, or (c) the child cannot access necessary care.====To measure impacts on early child health outcomes, we combine our records of strikes with data from several waves of Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) from 2003, 2008/09, and 2014. Child records in the DHS are linked to strikes by county, month, and year of birth. Our main empirical strategy relies on county and month–year fixed effects to compare outcomes of children born during a strike with others, conditional on where and when they are born. The key identifying assumption for this analysis is that the timing of strikes is exogenous to the timing of births, and we provide supporting evidence that this assumption holds, including no evidence of differential trends in births or outcomes within strike counties relative to other counties in Kenya, either in the months before or after strikes take place, and no difference in fixed characteristics of the mothers who give birth during strikes relative to those who give birth at other times.====We find that children born in counties during months when strikes occur are more likely to suffer a neonatal death. In particular, we estimate that a strike causes an additional 19 neonatal deaths per 1000 births, which represents a 68 percent increase in neonatal mortality relative to the overall sample mean. Both wild bootstrap and randomization inference permutation test based ====-values reject the null hypothesis of no effect beyond the 10 percent significance level (==== and ====, respectively). We show with a battery of alternate specifications, which relax assumptions about location effects and time trends or which impose various sample restrictions, that our point estimates are likely not an artifact of model choice.====As further evidence that we are not picking up a spurious correlation, we replicate our estimation of the effects of strikes on neonatal mortality using data from the Nairobi Urban Health and Demographic Surveillance System (NUHDSS). The NUHDSS tracks households in two urban informal settlements located near large hospitals in Nairobi with frequent strikes. In addition to information on exact day of birth and mortality, this data set also includes rich verbal autopsy data regarding cause of death. We again find statistically significant increases in neonatal mortality for children born on days when strikes occurred (====-values of .067 and .091 using cluster robust standard errors and randomization inference permutation tests, respectively), and we see that deaths of those born during strike days are disproportionately attributed to neonatal causes.====The effects we document are likely largely driven by newborns who require the services of striking hospitals, i.e. those that develop neonatal complications in the first few days of life. In a bench-marking exercise, we show that our results are consistent with a tripling in mortality among this subset of children. While large, effects of this size are in line with evidence on the efficacy of providing timely, adequate care for at-risk newborns. Indeed, access to a suite of readily-available interventions in low-income countries (such as clean delivery, antibiotics, and newborn resuscitation and temperature management, among others) has been estimated to reduce neonatal mortality by 55–82 percent (Jones et al., 2003, Darmstadt et al., 2005, Lawn et al., 2009, Bhutta et al., 2014). These estimates imply that when this care is not provided, neonatal mortality can be 122–455 percent higher.====Other studies also show large benefits of institutional births.==== Godlonton and Okeke (2016) find that a temporary ban on traditional birth attendants in Malawi increased facility deliveries and, among women whose closest facility is “high” quality, reduced 7-day mortality by 1.3–1.4 percentage points and 1-month mortality by 1.6–1.8 percentage points. Okeke and Chari (2018) use a difference-in-differences strategy to show that non-institutional births in Nigeria increase neonatal mortality by approximately 10 deaths per 1000 births overall (a doubling of the mean). In Ghana, Friedman and Keats (2020) find that a policy that made facility births free closed the rural–urban neonatal and infant mortality gap. Large effects have been found in high-income countries as well. Daysal et al. (2015) show hospital births among low-risk women in the Netherlands decrease neonatal mortality relative to home deliveries by 8 to 9 deaths per 1000 live births (compared to a base of 2 per 1000), while Almond et al. (2010) find that the package of services offered in US Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) reduces neonatal mortality by one percentage point (off of a base of 3.8 percentage points) for the marginal NICU entrant.====Nevertheless, we caution against taking our point estimates of the effect of strikes on neonatal mortality too literally. Our estimates, using either the DHS or NUHDSS samples, are imprecisely measured and our study is not powered to detect smaller effects. A growing literature highlights concerns that statistically significant results from low-powered studies may be exaggerated representations of treatment effects (Camerer et al., 2016, Camerer et al., 2018, Gelman and Carlin, 2014). Although the statistical evidence suggests a null effect is very unlikely, we cannot rule out a wide range of positive mortality effects that, while still economically significant, may be lower than what our point estimates suggest.====In addition to neonatal mortality, we also report on longer-run outcomes. We find no effects on post-neonatal infant mortality (deaths in the first year of life conditional on surviving the first month), suggesting that strikes cause excess mortality rather than accelerating deaths that would have occurred later in infancy. For children who survive, while we do not find any evidence of reductions in health status, we do find some suggestive evidence that vaccine take-up may be lower. We use child height- and weight-for-age ====-scores as summary measures of long- and short-term health, respectively, and find that neither outcome is affected by strikes. However, children born during strikes may be less likely to be fully vaccinated against common illnesses such as polio and measles, although these results are sensitive to the choice of specification. Given that the recommended immunization schedule for most vaccines begins once children are at least 6 weeks old, and that the typical strike lasts only 1 week, a reduction in vaccinations would suggest that strikes may have impacts on these and other important child health inputs that continue long after strikes have ended. While such a finding is consistent with prior literature on long-run impacts of interruptions to care (e.g. Goldstein et al., 2013, Sievertsen and Wüst, 2017, Okeke and Chari, 2018), we stress that the results in our study are more speculative.====Overall, our findings contribute to a small but growing literature on the causal links between healthcare quality and health outcomes. Björkman and Svensson (2009) find that a program that encouraged community monitoring in Uganda increased provider effort and had positive effects on under-5 mortality and infant weight. Similarly, Okeke (2019) finds that peer monitors in Nigeria increase doctor effort and patient reports of overall health. In addition, two randomized control trials examining pay-for-performance schemes in Rwanda and the Philippines, respectively, find that incentives increase provider productivity and improve child height and weight and self-reported health (Gertler and Vermeersch, 2013, Peabody et al., 2013). Our paper extends this literature by showing that disruptions to status quo care in top-line hospitals have negative effects on early child mortality, and suggests that when these disruptions do not occur, hospitals are providing immediate, and positive health benefits.====Finally, this paper contributes the first rigorous evidence on the effects of health-worker strikes in Sub-Saharan Africa, an apparently growing but still under-studied phenomenon. In 2014 alone health-worker strikes limited service provision in Kenya, Liberia, Nigeria, South Africa, Sudan, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. In the three years before, Botswana, Burundi, Ghana, Guinea Bissau, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Sierra Leone, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia also saw health-worker strikes. Prior evidence on the effects of these strikes is limited to a handful of medical case studies (Gyamfi, 2011, Bhuiyan and Machowski, 2012, Njuguna, 2015, Adam et al., 2018 see), which generally find that health outcomes are negatively correlated with strikes.==== However, while suggestive, these studies are based on extrapolating from the patients who visit a facility immediately prior to, during, or after a strike, and there may be important selection biases at work.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the data on health-worker strikes and outcomes, and provides additional context on the healthcare system in Kenya and on strike hospitals in particular. In Section 3 we outline the estimation strategy, and in Section 4 we present the results.

Our theoretical model, which includes ==== and ","When patients are referred from one physician to another, the provision of information by the referring physician is important for the optimal care of the patient. The referring physician has already made an assessment of the patient’s health and this information can help to treat the patient faster or to reduce the costs of the receiving physician. For example, the referring physician may know the patient’s relevant medical history, which is useful in diagnosing the patient more accurately and making faster treatment decisions.====The information flow between physicians, however, does not seem to be optimal. In a literature review, Mehrotra et al. (2011) find that many referrals do not include a transfer of information and when they do, the data is often insufficient for medical decision making (see also Bodenheimer, 2008). As a potential solution to this problem, Bodenheimer (2008) proposes that care coordination tasks should be financially rewarded. For example, Medicare has started paying physicians for care coordination services of chronically ill patients in 2015 (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, 2014).====In this paper, we present a model that considers both whether information is provided and, if information is provided, the quality of information. Information may be of low or high quality. High-quality information corresponds to a clear and complete report about the patient’s medical history and diagnostic results. Low-quality information corresponds to unclear or incomplete information. Usually, it is prohibitively costly for the payment authority in charge of remunerating health care services (the payer) to verify the quality of information provided by the physicians. Therefore, agency problems exist as the quality of information is private information of the physicians. Our model allows physicians to be partially altruistic towards their patients and fellow physicians. We further consider that some patients may benefit more from information provision than others. For example, for some patients treatment may be more urgent than for others and the information provided may speed up the treatment process.====We consider a bonus payment for information provision as a remedy for the under-provision of information. According to our model, the payment required to maximize the amount of provided high-quality information is a fraction of the costs of information provision. Increasing payments beyond this threshold only leads to the provision of more low-quality information. Finally, increasing the payment beyond the costs for low-quality information does not additionally change physician behavior.====In addition to the standard approach, we also include a non-linear version of our model that uses an S-shaped value function in the physician’s utility function. This version is inspired by previous behavioral research suggesting that individuals evaluate monetary losses and gains from a reference point differently (see, e.g., Kuehberger, 1998, Bleichrodt et al., 2001, Abdellaoui et al., 2007). Although prospect theory has been initially suggested for risky contexts to explain such reference-dependent preferences (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979), Tversky and Kahneman (1991) apply its properties also to riskless decisions like those in our experiment (see, e.g., Gaechter et al., 2010, for experimental evidence). Here, physicians may also decide depending on a reference point because they can be faced with a decision between a monetary gain (providing low-quality information) and a monetary loss (providing high-quality information) for some levels of bonus payments. In contrast to the linear version, our non-linear model suggests that the amount of high-quality information provision can decrease with an increase in the payment for information provision. Furthermore, if the payments are increased beyond the costs of high-quality information provision, the effect reverses and more high-quality information is provided. This latter effect is caused primarily by loss aversion.====We test the theoretical predictions derived from our two models in a laboratory experiment. Using a controlled lab environment that allows ceteris paribus variations of bonus payments and benefits from information provision, we are able to establish the causal link between payments and the provision of information (for a general discussion of the experimental method see, e.g., Frechette and Schotter, 2015, and for a discussion of health economics experiments see Galizzi and Wiesen, 2018).==== In our experiment, subjects in the role of primary care physicians (PCPs) decide on passing on information to subjects in the role of specialists while referring a patient. In all experimental conditions, we use a within-subject design and systematically vary the bonus payment as well as the benefit from information provision at the subject level to test the influence of both parameters. In our baseline condition, we focus on a situation in which the patient benefits from information provision and in which the PCP always earns less money than the specialist. The latter is typically the case in most OECD countries (OECD, 2015). Note that in this baseline condition bonus payments for information provision are implemented in addition to a fixed capitation payment. This additional payment may not be cost-effective from the payer’s perspective, though. Accordingly, we implement a second experimental condition to test the behavioral effects of a cost-neutral version of the bonus payments.====With our remaining three experimental conditions we check the robustness of our behavioral results. First, we change the beneficiary of information provision (specialist instead of patient). Second, we alter the payoff relation between the PCP and the beneficiary. While the PCP always earns less than the beneficiary from information provision in the previous three conditions, we implement two additional conditions in which the PCP always earns more than the beneficiary (patient or specialist). Note that, without additional assumptions, the predictions derived from our two models do not imply a behavioral impact of these changes (cost neutrality, beneficiary, and payoff relation). Still, there is behavioral evidence suggesting such an impact (see the finding by Kesternich et al., 2015, on the role of the receiver type in medically framed distribution and cost dispersion games or the research on inequality aversion by, e.g., Fehr and Schmidt, 1999, Bolton and Ockenfels, 2000).====As predicted by our model, PCPs in the experiment pass on more low- and high-quality information as the bonus payment increases. If the bonus payment is at least as high as the costs for the provision of high-quality information, PCPs provide less low-quality information and more high-quality information than in decision tasks with lower bonus payments. This behavioral pattern is in line with the non-linear version of our model considering an aversion to lose profit relative to a reference profit in addition to altruism. Moreover, we observe that PCPs’ reactions to increases in the bonus payment are similar regardless of whether the bonus payment is introduced cost-neutrally or not. Accordingly, taking the perspective of a payer who trades off the benefit of information provision against his payments, we find that bonus payments exceeding the cost of low-quality information are only efficient if the bonus payment is introduced cost neutrally.====Checking the robustness of our results with regard to the type of the receiver and the payoff relation between the PCP and the beneficiary, we find similar behavioral responses to the bonus payment and the benefit of information provision across all conditions. Still, PCPs tend to make more selfish decisions and provide less high-quality information when two conditions are met — first, the specialist instead of the patient benefits from information provision and second, the PCP earns less than the specialist.====In sum, our study is the first to provide a model that allows to describe the effect of different bonus payments on information provision between physicians. In addition, using the controlled environment of a laboratory, we are able to test the predictions of this model and to check the robustness of results. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the conditions under which information provision between physicians can be effective.",Rewards for information provision in patient referrals: A theoretical model and an experimental test,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629622000923,10 October 2022,2022,Research Article,38.0

Infants and those in-utero are specifically more susceptible to external stressors. Dire economic situations and adverse shocks can influence their initial health endowment, which, in turn, changes the trajectory of their later-life outcomes (Almond et al., 2018; Almond and Currie, 2011b; Barker, 1994, 1997; Currie, 2009, 2011). Studies find that adverse economic conditions during in-utero, infancy, and childhood influence adult health, hospitalization, education, labor market outcomes, and old-age health and mortality (Flores and Kalwij, 2014; Freedman et al., 2008; Lillard et al., 2015; Montez and Hayward, 2011; Scholte et al., 2015; Sotomayor, 2013). Social welfare programs have the potential to offset the negative shocks and boost short-term and long-term health outcomes. Some social insurance programs, such as Medicaid, are designed as a health policy intervention. Others may target economic security, yet their spillover and unintended externalities may also be observed in health outcomes (Boyd-Swan et al., 2016; Hoynes et al., 2015; Markowitz et al., 2017; Nelson and Fritzell, 2014; Noghanibehambari and Salari, 2020; Salm, 2011). These studies usually find evidence that the interventions are more effective among populations of color, people of lower socioeconomic status, and those who are unemployed, and that the effects are more pronounced when the economy is going through a downturn (Kuka, 2020; Wehby et al., 2020).====During the 1930s, Americans experienced the greatest downturn in their economic history. The infamous Great Depression left millions of people unemployed and caused sharp and unprecedented reductions in income. The deep recession limited access to necessary material resources, as was evident by reports on children's malnutrition and bread lines on the streets (McElvaine, 1993). The federal government responded to the situation by establishing programs to stimulate the economy, boost confidence in the market, and provide material assistance to unemployed persons and impoverished families. The Roosevelt administration took a series of initiatives to promote social welfare. The Social Security Act of 1935 complemented earlier small-scale programs to support infants, children, and older adults. Welfare spending under Roosevelt's New Deal programs revolutionized the structure of social insurance and safety net in the US. Per capita spending increased by twenty-fold between the years 1929–1938. Despite the enormous scale of the Great Depression and unparalleled increases in welfare spending, the economics literature on the health-related effects of New Deal spending is quite limited (see Fishback (2017), for a review). Furthermore, very few studies explore the longer-run effects of welfare spending on health outcomes and specifically old-age mortality. This study fills this gap in the literature by documenting the association between in-utero and early-life exposure to the New Deal relief spending on subsequent longevity.====We use death records from the Social Security Administration linked with the full-count 1940 census. The data provides us with granular and detailed geographic level data for the early-life period in addition to a full battery of family characteristics. We also employ city-level data on welfare spending and grants allocation before and during the New Deal era (1929–1940) for 115 major cities across the US. The spending data cover programs providing assistance to poor families, unemployed workers, and other populations in need via the Old-Age Assistance (OAA) program, Aid to Dependent Children (ADC), Aid for the Blind, private donations, direct relief assistance, work relief assistance, and payments through the Works Progress Administration (WPA). These combined programs constitute an increase of twentyfold in total assistance per capita between the years 1929–1938, an unprecedented rise in welfare spending in American history. We implement panel data fixed effect models and take advantage of city-level differences in deviations from city-specific trends to compare the longevity of individuals born within the same region and birth year. The results suggest considerable improvements in longevity. Conditional on a full set of covariates, an increase of 100 percent in municipal per capita spending is correlated with 1 month higher longevity for those born in the city in that year.====We argue that these effects are not driven by selection of births based on observable individual and parental characteristics. We show that the effects are not driven by changes in the composition of births and selective fertility. Additional tests do not provide concerning evidence that Numident-census linkage of observations induces an endogenous demographic change in the final matched sample. We also implement a series of placebo tests in which we assign spending to people aged 10 and 15, children whose longevity may have benefited less than those who experienced increased spending in-utero and during early-life. These tests search for the association between welfare spending and overall trends in population health, medical care use, and other health-related technologies that could be detected in old-age longevity. The placebo tests fail to provide evidence of such associations, supporting the robustness of the effect of in utero exposure to higher social welfare spending on subsequent mortality.====To search for pathways, we implement two sets of analyses. First, we complement the literature that documents the early-life influences on adult outcomes, including education and income (Almond et al., 2018; Almond and Currie, 2011b; Currie, 2009; Garces et al., 2002; Goodman-Bacon, 2021). We use census and American Community Survey data and focus on similar birth cohorts and spending at the state-year-of-birth. We show that in-utero and early-life spending is associated with significant improvements in educational outcomes, measures of the socioeconomic index, and family income. Second, we posit that these improvements could lead to better health outcomes throughout one's life cycle and be detected in old-age mortality outcomes. While this link can be inferred from the bulk of studies that establish a link between education-income profiles and old-age mortality, we implement a series of two-sample two-stage-least-square analyses that reveal the importance of improvements in education-income as channels of impact.====This paper makes several important contributions to the literature. First, to our knowledge, this is among the first studies to examine the effects of welfare spending and the introduction of New Deal programs during in-utero and early-life on old-age longevity, and the first to do so in a geographically and demographically diverse sample (Modrek et al., 2022). As most of welfare spending during the Great Depression did not specifically target pregnant women and new-born children, our findings shed light on the potential long-run externalities of broad welfare programs and add to the growing literature exploring the health externalities of non-health social spending (Bailey et al., 2016; Braga et al., 2020; Classen and Dunn, 2012; Duflo, 2000; Hoynes et al., 2015; Kuka, 2020; Noghanibehambari and Salari, 2020; Tefft, 2011; Wehby et al., 2020) and the long-term economic and health outcomes of early-life exposures (Almond et al., 2018; Almond and Currie, 2011a, 2011b; Barker, 1990, 1994, 1997, 2004; Barker et al., 1989, 1993, 2002; Campbell et al., 2014; Goodman-Bacon, 2021; Hayward and Gorman, 2004; Heckman, 2007; Hoynes et al., 2016). The Great Depression exercised a universal and deep effect on local economies across the nation, and the cohorts of the 1930s were uniquely exposed to both the long-term economic hardships associated with the Great Depression and the unprecedented scale of the New Deal policy response during a critical period of their development. This economic shock and the accompanying social spending were the largest in American history and provide an unprecedented and newly relevant opportunity for examining the long-term impacts of large-scale government relief spending on a key summary measure of population health – longevity. Mortality is among the most accurately captured measures of health and several studies suggest that it is correlated with other old-age health measures (Buchman et al., 2012; Lubitz et al., 2003; Mathers et al., 2001). Exploring the linkages between spending and subsequent longevity also provides opportunities to extend research into the Fetal Origins Hypothesis by documenting the relevance of exposure to social spending while in-utero and in early-life on later-life health and longevity.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we provide a background on New Deal programs. In section 3, we review the literature. In section 4, we review the data and sample construction.

To this end, we exploit plant closures and use flexible event-study estimations together with an experimentally elicited measure of fluid intelligence, namely word recall. We find that, within a time period of around eight years after the event of unemployment, cognitive abilities only deteriorate marginally — the effects are insignificant both in statistical and economic terms. We do, however, find significant effects of late-career unemployment on the likelihood to leave the labor force, and short-term effects on mental ==== such as depression and sleep problems.","Cognitive abilities are essential for good economic decisions (see, e.g., Tymula et al., 2013, Christelis et al., 2010, Banks and Oldfield, 2007, Banks et al., 2010, Smith et al., 2010). A continuing decline in cognitive abilities, as is normal at older ages, may even impede the very basic decisions involved in activities of daily living (see, for instance, Nishiguchi et al., 2013). Together with depression and after hypertension, strong cognitive impairment is also the second most frequent diagnosis of long-term care dependent persons in nursing homes in the USA (Harris-Kojetin et al., 2019). Interesting from an economic point of view is that many decisions over the life course themselves affect cognitive abilities. For instance, economists have almost traditionally studied the process of human capital accumulation—most importantly determinants and effects of education—where cognitive abilities are an important part of human capital. However, much less is known about the process of human capital ====, see McFadden (2008) or Mazzonna and Peracchi (2018). An exception is the relationship between retirement and cognitive abilities that has recently been studied by several authors in the economic literature, see, Rohwedder and Willis (2010), Bonsang et al. (2012), Coe et al. (2012), Celidoni et al. (2017), Mazzonna and Peracchi, 2012, Mazzonna and Peracchi, 2017, Mosca and Wright (2018), Atalay et al. (2019), Schmitz and Westphal (2021). By and large, this literature finds that time spent in retirement reduces cognitive abilities.====The main explanation for this finding is the ==== (Hultsch et al., 1999, Salthouse, 2006), also called ==== (Rohwedder and Willis, 2010) or ==== (Hertzog et al., 2008). It states that mental stimulation, potentially due to labor market participation, slows down the natural process of neuro-degeneration and, thus, cognitive aging. Nevertheless, little is known about determinants of cognitive decline among individuals younger than the statutory retirement age. This is surprising given that labor economists typically consider skill depreciation to affect re-employment wages whenever analyzing absenteeism from the labor force, e.g. due to parental leave (see Schönberg and Ludsteck, 2014) or due to unemployment (as, for instance in Schmieder et al., 2016). In this paper, we study the effects of unemployment on the decline of cognitive abilities. By looking at the effect of economic inactivity in a sample of individuals between 50 and 65 years of age—late in the individual employment career—we address an important gap in the social sciences literature given that age-related cognitive decline already starts well before retirement age.====We are aware of several studies on the relationship between unemployment and cognitive abilities—although none of them is claiming causality. Vélez-Coto et al. (2021) review those previous findings and conduct a meta-analysis of six studies from the psychological and medical literature, indicating a negative association between unemployment and cognitive abilities. However, our paper also relates to the broader literature on general effects of job loss and unemployment. Initially, the focus of this literature was on studying wages and earnings, finding large and persistent earnings effects, which seems to be primarily driven by labor force participation and to a smaller extent though wages (for European evidence using administrative data see, for instance, Schmieder et al., 2010, Eliason and Storrie, 2006, and Huttunen et al., 2011). By studying cognitive decline, our paper could provide an explanation for the persistent effects. Subsequently, the emphasis shifted towards the impact on health. Examples are Sullivan and Von Wachter (2009), Salm (2009), Mandal et al. (2011), Marcus (2014), Browning and Heinesen (2012), Kuhn et al. (2009) or Eliason and Storrie, 2009b, Eliason and Storrie, 2009a, Green (2011), Böckermann and Ilmakunnas (2009), Schmitz (2011), Marcus (2013), Schiele and Schmitz (2016). Here, the results are mixed and depend on countries and outcomes studied as well as the time horizon. Some studies (among them Salm, 2009, and Schmitz, 2011) find zero effects of unemployment on health, while several other studies do find significantly negative health effects. As is still the exception in this literature, we make use of transparent analyses using event-study methods. These methods may inform about potential anticipation effects necessary for a causal interpretation and allow to study dynamic properties of the effect.====As our main data source, we use the Survey of Health Ageing, and Retirement (SHARE) that includes data from 29 European countries and Israel. The data set has the advantage to include experimentally elicited measures of cognitive ability like the ==== that allow studying cognitive decline already in a sample that is younger than retirement age. Register data, that may be preferred for other reasons, usually either include measures of cognitive ability early in life (like IQ tests among young men from medical examinations) or physician diagnoses of mild cognitive impairments or dementia that have very low incidences among individuals below 65. We are able to identify changes in cognitive ability that are below the threshold of diagnosed cognitive impairment. The panel structure of our data enables us to examine the cognitive path for those who experience unemployment and follow them for up to eight years.====In our data set that spans over the years 2004–2020, we can exploit about 3000 unemployment episodes and match these to a control group of 19,000 individuals that are not unemployed throughout the observation period. In several different specifications we do not find economically or statistically significant effects of later-career unemployment on cognitive abilities, neither in the short-, nor in the longer run. The largest effect is a loss of 0.2 words in the word recall test after about four years which is less than ten percent of a standard deviation or two percent of the mean value of recalled words. This effect returns to zero after six years. This result of a—if any—very small effect is consistent with a common finding in the literature on the effects of retirement on cognitive abilities. Typically, there is no sizable instantaneous effect of retirement but one that increases with time in retirement. For instance, Schmitz and Westphal (2021) find retirement effects on word recall to start at around 0 upon retirement (on average) and linearly increase to −1 after ten years. Given that the median unemployment duration in our data set is 1.3 years, there seems to be not much room for larger cognitive impairment.====The results are robust across subgroups like sex, age groups and all reasons of unemployment vs. plant closures. They also hold for other measures of cognitive ability like verbal fluency or numeracy and are also found in the USA and England, when we use data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). However, this does not mean that late-career unemployment does not have any effects at all. We do observe a short-term effect on depression which, however, disappears after two years when the unemployment episode typically is over. In addition, we find a small and marginally significant effect on sleep problems. Finally, we find that unemployment triggers the end of the labor-force career in many cases. Our analyses show that the likelihood to retire increases by about ten percentage points as a consequence of unemployment. The most likely explanation of our findings is that unemployment does not have an immediate effect on cognition among 50–65 years old individuals but leads to retirement being brought forward by a couple of years.

The evidence with respect to maternal and child health, however, is less conclusive with recent reviews and meta-studies pointing out that some evaluations have shown positive impacts, while several others reported mixed or null results (Attanasio et al., 2014b, Baird et al., 2014, Bastagli et al., 2016, Biscaye et al., 2017, Gaarder et al., 2010, Ladhani and Sitter, 2020, Millan et al., 2019, Tirivayi et al., 2016).====To strengthen the impact of cash transfers on health outcomes, these programs have begun to be re-designed as cash-plus programs, combining cash with additional interventions, services, or transfers (Bhutta et al., 2013, Glassman et al., 2013, Roelen et al., 2017). In terms of improving maternal and child health outcomes, a popular complementary component involves behavioral change communication (BCC), an approach that emphasizes the role of information in health production by promoting certain knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and practices (Avula et al., 2013, Carneiro et al., 2021). While in general the evidence on the effectiveness of cash-plus BCC components appears still to be scarce and inconclusive (Gilligan et al., 2020, Little et al., 2021, Premand and Barry, 2022), some recent studies show that child nutrition outcomes (Ahmed et al., 2019, Field and Maffioli, 2021, Khan et al., 2019) and maternal knowledge (Levere et al., 2016) could only be improved in treatment arms that involved complementary BCC components.====The ‘traditional’ implementation of BCC interventions, as studied in the existing health-related cash-plus literature, typically involves regular individual and/or group-based face-to-face meetings with program facilitators. In this context, given high operational costs, ‘traditional’ BCC interventions often need to be strictly targeted towards individuals who are (i) particularly vulnerable or (ii) more likely to contribute to spreading and disseminating information within their communities. Consequently, adding a–possibly beneficial–‘traditional’ BCC component to cash transfers is not a trivial policy decision as it typically involves new implementation challenges and leads to substantially higher operational costs of an often already expensive program (Benhassine et al., 2015). In particular, in a context in which governments have limited resources for social protection the extra costs involved for recruiting and training qualified staff, travel expenses, and wages of facilitators need to be carefully considered.====A promising alternative to the more ‘traditional’ BCC implementations relates to low-cost mHealth solutions. Systematic reviews have shown that mHealth interventions are feasible across a wide range of cultural and geographical settings with a number of studies showing positive impacts of standalone mHealth BCC interventions.==== Furthermore, given the comparatively low cost of mHealth campaigns, these interventions are more likely to be offered universally and do not necessarily require stricter access criteria and targeting as part of its implementation.====Ultimately, it is an empirical question whether an mHealth BCC component can be successful in the cash-plus context. First, it is difficult to extrapolate findings from existing mHealth BCC studies. Besides documented large variations in effect sizes, the circumstance that the target population is enrolled in a cash program modifies several parameters such as attentiveness, reciprocity, and trust relationships, which have been associated with the performance of mHealth interventions. Second, insights and benchmarks gained from the existing cash-plus BCC literature cannot be readily transferred to the mHealth context as intervention features differ in important ways.====In this paper, we examine whether a simple and low-cost mHealth BCC component can improve health behavior & outcomes among poor women who are enrolled in a conditional cash transfer program (CCT). Specifically, our research attempts to answer three main questions: Can a text messaging campaign help increase maternal health practices and outcomes among CCT beneficiaries? Which type of health indicators are particularly responsive? Which implementation and behavioral factors are correlated with the success and/or failure of such a campaign?====The context of our study is PKH (Program Keluarga Harapan) in Indonesia. PKH covers about 10 million households and is the country’s flagship social protection program. Evaluations of PKH revealed that the program led to poverty reductions, increases in school enrollment (Cahyadi et al., 2020, WB, 2012), and a mixed impact on a broad range of health indicators (Christian et al., 2019, Kusuma et al., 2016, Triyana, 2016). While PKH managed to reduce child stunting rates by 10pp in the long-term, the program did not show lasting improvements in health knowledge, breastfeeding practices, pre- and post-natal care, and childhood vaccinations (Cahyadi et al., 2020).====In response to PKH’s limited impact on maternal and child health, we collaborated with the government of Indonesia (GoI) to explore whether an mHealth BCC campaign–more specifically, one-directional text messages–can improve maternal health knowledge, behavior, and outcomes among PKH beneficiaries in relation to five health topics: postnatal care, child vaccinations, hygiene practices, maternal anemia, and child anthropometrics. The intervention involved sending out three health-related sms per week over a period of twelve months. To evaluate the short-term impact of the intervention, we implemented a clustered-RCT in which 1821 beneficiaries in 127 villages were randomly assigned to either a control group (PKH) or a treatment group (PKH + mHealth BCC).====Overall, our results suggest that the mHealth BCC campaign substantially improved maternal health behavior & outcomes. Mothers’ postnatal care practices improved by 8pp (15%), child vaccination rates by 7pp (9%), hygiene practices by 10pp (50%), while maternal anemia rates dropped by 10pp (20%). Regarding child anthropometric outcomes, we obtain suggestive evidence that the sms campaign might have helped reduce stunting rates among children below the age of five—in particular children who were exposed to the intervention at early ages (2–14 months of age at baseline). In contrast, we show that the sms campaign did not improve the incidence of wasting among children under five.====Examining possible channels that may help explain our main findings, we demonstrate that the sms campaign successfully improved mothers’ health knowledge in three out five targeted health dimensions. Adopting a heterogeneous treatment effect framework, we further provide suggestive evidence that particular implementation design features affect maternal health behavior & outcomes differently. While we find that health knowledge gains are strongly associated with improvements in hygiene practices and anemia reduction, we believe that the reminder and/or nudge components inherent in our sms campaign are more likely to explain observed changes in postnatal care practices and child vaccination rates. Lastly, employing a behavior change theory framework we illustrate that our interventions seems to have been particular successful among mothers who had a positive attitude towards the intervention.====Our experiment advances the relevant literature in two ways. First, we add to the existing cash-plus literature by examining the effectiveness of complementary components that leverage mobile devices and technologies. While the existing literature covers a broad set of different types of interventions related to the role of conditionalities (Baird et al., 2011, Benhassine et al., 2015, Brollo et al., 2017), benefit amounts (Filmer and Schady, 2009, Haushofer and Shapiro, 2016), benefit types (Ahmed et al., 2019, Langendorf et al., 2014), access to services (Banerjee et al., 2021, Guanais, 2013), and in-person face-to-face interventions for trainings, mentoring, and counseling (Ahmed et al., 2019, Ahmed et al., 2020, Arriagada et al., 2020, Fiala, 2018, Gilligan et al., 2020, Karlan et al., 2015, Premand and Barry, 2022, Roy et al., 2019, Sedlmayr et al., 2020), only little evidence on the impact of mobile solutions yet exists.==== Our findings suggest that mobile solutions can be an effective complement and/or substitute of more conventional in-person interventions.====Second, we contribute to the mHealth literature in economics and public health. To the best of our knowledge existing studies in economics have almost exclusively focused on two subgroups that are very different from the population we study: (i) patients (Pop-Eleches et al., 2011, Raifman et al., 2014) and (ii) the general population (Bahety et al., 2021, Banerjee et al., 2020, Dammert et al., 2014, Falco and Zaccagni, 2021, Grepin et al., 2019).==== In addition to these studies, we examine a different and much broader set of health indicators.====Furthermore, while there are plenty of studies in the medical and public health literature that investigate the impact of mHealth interventions, systematic reviews and meta-studies have pointed out that only few studies go beyond intention-to-treat estimates with results often somewhat appearing questionable due to inadequate controls for selection effects (into and out of the intervention/survey) and small sample sizes (Agravat, 2013, Blaya et al., 2010, Cole-Lewis and Kershaw, 2010, Fjelsoe et al., 2009, Hall et al., 2015, Orr and King, 2015, Sondaal et al., 2016). Moreover, as described in Armanasco et al. (2017) there is a lack of mHealth studies that is able to elicit pathways and mechanisms through which mHealth interventions work. By employing a research framework that links to mHealth implementation features (information vs. reminders vs. nudges) and behavior change theories (theory of planned behavior), we believe that our study is able to shed more light on contextual factors that facilitate or prevent the success of mHealth interventions.====This paper proceeds in six sections. Section 2 provides background on PKH and our intervention. Section 3 describes our data and field implementation. Section 4 presents the main results and explores robustness checks. Section 5 examines moderators and pathways responsible for our results. Section 6 discusses policy implications related to the main findings.

Thus, preventing hospital exit is not a cost effective way to save lives on average. However, exits of some ==== with larger impacts on access to care increase the mortality rate and produce lower cost per life saved estimates.","Some have argued that a substantial amount of health care does not benefit patients, and thus people regularly receive services for which the social marginal cost exceeds the marginal benefit (Berwick and Hackbarth, 2012, Cutler, 2014, Schwartz et al., 2014). However, some health care services clearly pass this cost–benefit test, and policies that reduce care on the wrong margins could be harmful. US hospitals are both a source of significant health care spending, over ==== trillion annually, and life-saving health care.==== Reduced access to hospitals could generate substantial savings without affecting patient health if the care provided by marginal hospitals is sufficiently low-value or cause significant harm if the care provided by marginal hospitals is high-value.====Estimates of the benefit of marginal hospitals are needed to evaluate policies that affect access to hospitals. For example, since 1997 Medicare has paid rural Critical Access Hospitals higher rates to prevent them from exiting at a cost of around ==== billion dollars a year (Gowrisankaran et al., 2017 and MedPAC, 2012). Concerns about health care access have also motivated protests over hospital exits including a North Carolina mayor who walked to Washington, DC following the death of one of his constituents after the local hospital exited.==== On the other hand, 35 states have certificate of need laws that could limit hospital entry and reduce health care spending.==== Whether such policies are beneficial depends in part on whether hospital entry and exit affects mortality rates and at what cost. There is little evidence of the number of lives saved per dollar spent at this margin. This lack of evidence is in part because precise estimates require large numbers of entries and exits and an identification strategy that accounts for endogenous hospital entry and exit.====In this paper, I evaluate one dimension of this cost–benefit trade-off - the effect of hospital entry and exit on health care utilization and mortality rates. I estimate the effect of entering and exiting hospitals on hospital costs, measures of utilization like hospital admissions and ER visits, and mortality rates using a difference-in-differences design and nearly 1300 general hospital entries and exits during the 1982–2010 time period. The large number of events allows for precise estimates of the effect of hospitals on the margin of exiting on mortality rates in their communities. The long sample period and detailed data also allow me to check for pre-trends and construct placebo tests to show the estimates are plausibly causal.====I quantify this dimension of the cost–benefit analysis using the number of lives saved per unit of health care. It is the ratio of the change in the mortality rate in an area following a hospital entry or exit to the change in hospital operational costs or admissions caused by an entry or exit. This ratio is a parameter that is useful for informing policies that seek to prevent hospital exit and restrict hospital entry. However, it does not measure the full benefit of entering or exiting hospitals because these events could affect health without affecting mortality rates and have other benefits and costs that I discuss in Section 6.====I find that both hospital entry and exit cause an immediate, persistent change in the amount of hospital-based health care people receive. Exits reduce the total cost of operating all hospitals in their health service area by a statistically significant ==== per person while entries increase costs by a marginally significant ==== per person. There are substantial effects on the extensive margin of hospital care. Following an exit the number of admissions fall by 1.0 per 1000 people and ER visits fall by 4.9 per 1000 people, i.e., about 0.8 percent of the admissions and 1.5 percent of ER visits in each health service area.====Despite significant effects on the quantity of care, I find hospital entry and exit have no immediate effect on the all-cause mortality rate in the county and evidence that exit ==== all-cause mortality in the long-term. The mortality estimates paired with the substantial reduction in health care costs and utilization suggest the cost-per-life-saved from preventing hospital exit is high on average. I can reject that the number lives saved per million dollars spent at exiting hospitals is greater than 0.05, which is about $==== million per life saved. However, this high cost-per-life-saved is driven by hospitals with readily available alternatives. Exits with larger impacts on access to care cause mortality rates in the county to increase significantly in some specifications, and have cost-per life saved estimates in the $1.9 to $2.9 million range. There is also evidence that the average exit causes harm to some patients via statistically significantly higher AMI (heart attack) and kidney disease mortality among people living in the hospital’s county.====The high cost-per-life-saved and long-term decrease in mortality in counties following exit is driven by exits in places where people can switch to nearby alternative hospitals and who may still be able to quickly access care in an emergency. Consistent with this interpretation, the effect of exit on inpatient utilization is the smallest for people whose next closest hospital is nearby. Additionally, I show that the potential harm from exit is mitigated to some degree because it does not affect admissions for the most severe diagnoses and it causes patients to be admitted to higher quality hospitals measured using risk-adjusted mortality rates following AMI admissions.====The null effects I estimate for admissions for diagnoses that are severe or not deferrable (e.g., hip fracture admissions or births), suggest my estimates are not biased by shocks that coincide with hospital entry/exit and that affect both deferrable and non-deferrable conditions. These estimates effectively serve as placebo tests. In addition, most plots of the leads of hospital entry/exit show no evidence of pre-trends that would indicate the estimates are biased by changes in demand for care that precede the entry or exit event.====My paper is most closely related to work that has looked at the effect of hospital exits on both health care utilization and mortality rates. Joynt et al. (2015) found that 195 hospital exits from 2003–2011 did not significantly affect the amount of inpatient care Medicare beneficiaries’ received or the probability they died during the two years following an exit. However, their confidence intervals included changes in the mortality rate and the quantity of care of a sufficient size that we cannot draw firm conclusions about the benefit or harm of hospital exits. Subsequent work by Carroll (2019) focused on rural hospitals that are small enough to be eligible for the Critical Access Hospital program. She found that exits reduced utilization of hospital care and increased mortality for Medicare patients admitted to the hospital for time-sensitive conditions with a cost to Medicare per quality-adjusted life-year saved of $16,000.====My paper expands the focus of study to hospital entries and exits in both urban and rural areas, small and large hospitals, and to all patients rather than only Medicare patients. It has a sufficient number of events to reject that preventing the average exiting hospital from closing is a cost effective way to save lives. In addition, I contribute to the literature by showing there is substantial heterogeneity in the effects of hospitals on the margin of exiting depending on the availability of alternatives and by providing evidence for why this heterogeneity exists.====The literature on the incremental benefit of health care largely estimates the benefit along the intensive margin, i.e., conditional on receiving treatment at a hospital (Almond et al., 2010, Almond et al., 2011, Almond and Doyle, 2011, Doyle, 2011, Doyle et al., 2015, Doyle et al., 2017, Jena et al., 2014, Silver, 2021), although studies of the effect of health insurance status on health can be interpreted as measuring the marginal return on care on a combination of the intensive and extensive margins (e.g., Doyle, 2005, Sommers et al., 2012). Many, but not all, of the studies focused on the intensive margin have found that higher quantities of treatment improve survival rates. My paper contributes to this literature by providing estimates of the cost of saving lives along a different, policy relevant margin. My estimates may differ from this literature because my results suggest that patients who are at the margin of being admitted to the hospital have less severe conditions than some inframarginal patients, particularly when there is another hospital nearby, and I find evidence that exits shift inframarginal patients to higher quality hospitals.====My estimates on the quantity of inpatient care and AMI mortality in counties point in the same direction as papers that have estimated the effect of changes the number of hospitals or ERs on each of these outcomes individually. My quantity estimates are consistent with the Chung et al. (2017) result that hospital entry due to hospital construction subsidies in the 1948–1975 period increased admissions in counties, and the Garthwaite et al. (2018) finding that hospital exits in the 1987–2000 period reduced hospital revenue in commuting zones but not spending on uncompensated care. I also find evidence that hospital exit increases AMI mortality which is consistent with estimates of the effect of emergency department closures on AMI mortality in the US (Shen and Hsia, 2016), the effect of hospital closures in LA County on AMI mortality and accidental deaths (Buchmueller et al., 2006), and hospital closures in Sweden on AMI mortality (Avdic, 2016).",The marginal benefit of hospitals: Evidence from the effect of entry and exit on utilization and mortality rates,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629622001035,21 September 2022,2022,Research Article,42.0

Technology adoption in health care is a key determinant of productivity in this sector, and technology is widely considered the central driver of long-term productivity gains in the broader economy (Jorgenson, 2011). However, unique features of the health care sector, like information frictions and insurance, can distort the quality and quantity of technology adoption. If patients or their agents (such as referring physicians) have a preference for technology or use it as a proxy for quality, the introduction of a new technology will increase demand and prompt adoption by care providers. New technology has the potential to promote a wave of adoption as hospitals compete over the same set of patients, resulting in service duplication and increased cost. In this way, adoption could theoretically go beyond the socially optimal level, a phenomenon known in health care as the “medical arms race”.====In this study, we ask how technology adoption impacts utilization of hospital care to better understand its role in the performance of the health care sector. We use the diffusion of robotic surgery for the treatment of prostate cancer to investigate how patients or their agents respond. Adoption of surgical robotics proceeded exceptionally rapidly: from its introduction in 2001 through 2015, about half of hospitals in the U.S. that treat cancer patients adopted a robot (Fig. 1). Focusing on surgical removal of the prostate, termed prostatectomy, allows us to assess how patient volume changes in response to a new technology from inception along its trajectory to becoming the predominant method of intensive intervention for these patients. Additionally, surgical robots are a frequent focus of hospital advertising, pointing toward their potential use by patients as a signal of quality (Schwartz and Woloshin, 2019, Sheetz et al., 2020).====Our differences-in-differences research design exploits variation in the timing of adoption across hospitals in the U.S. to estimate the effect of robotic surgery on patient volume and characteristics. We show that adoption leads to a statistically significant and economically meaningful rise in hospital volume: prostate cancer admissions (the risk set for robotic surgical intervention) increase by 60 log points and prostatectomies (in which the robot can be used) increase by 70 log points. In event study plots, we show that these estimates average over effects that increase over time. These results are consistent with patients – or their agents – having a preference for robotic surgery or viewing it as indicative of quality; they are also consistent with surgeons having a preference for robotic intervention.====Increases in patient admissions would arise if robotic device adoption expanded the market for robotic surgery. On the other hand, our estimates are also suggestive of business stealing in which hospitals adopt surgical robots to compete over the same patients. To distinguish between market expansion and business stealing, we also implement our research design at the health care market level. We show that as hospitals in a market adopt surgical robots, the volume of prostate cancer patients and prostatectomies in the entire market rises in response. Surgical robot adoption thus leads to meaningful expansions in the market for intensive intervention. These effects are statistically and economically significant, but are half the magnitude of the hospital-level results. Using event study plots to illustrate dynamics of the effects, we find that they grow over time but on a shallower trajectory than their hospital-level counterparts. Taking these findings together, we conclude that some of the hospital-level effects also reflect business stealing in which adoption leads to a re-shuffling of patients.====A corollary is that our hospital-level results likely have some expansion bias due to contamination of the control group, since adopters “steal” patients from non-adopters. We address this issue by additionally implementing differences-in-differences designs that narrow the control group to hospitals in markets with no adoption, limiting the potential for contamination. As expected, this approach returns hospital-level effects that are attenuated by one-third to one-fourth but are still larger than the market-level effects.====Our results raise the question of who receives treatment at the margin when a hospital adopts a surgical robot and patient volume expands. We apply our main estimation strategy to study two key characteristics of patients, age and pre-existing burden of illness. We find that adoption of surgical robots brings relatively younger and healthier patients to the hospital for treatment. A key concern is that prostatectomy induced by robot adoption could provide little value to patients and society because the recipients may have short remaining life expectancy (they would likely die of another competing health risk) or have severe existing health conditions (they are at a high risk of adverse surgical outcomes) (Lepor, 2000). Our findings reject the idea that surgical robotics is expanding treatment among this group. Thus, we find no sign that adoption broadens eligibility criteria for surgical intervention in a way that would attract patients who, at least on observable characteristics, are likely to benefit little from treatment.====Robotic surgery is an interesting object of study of health care technology and its diffusion for several reasons. First, surgical robots represent an intermediate-cost technology with relatively low formal barriers to adoption. The initial capital investment of $1 to $2.5 million is significantly less than the cost of cardiac catheterization laboratories which have been the focus of much prior research (Barbash and Glied, 2010, Cutler et al., 2010). A majority of states do not have certificate of need (CON) laws or have laws that would not be triggered by the purchase of a surgical robot compared to higher-cost technologies (National Conference of State Legislatures, 2019).==== At the same time, installing a surgical robot is clearly more expensive than the low-cost technology that has also been a focus of the literature, ==== blockers (Skinner and Staiger, 2007, Skinner and Staiger, 2015). Second, whether physicians use a robot for prostate surgery has no bearing on the Medicare physician or hospital payment for the procedure and evidence for clinical benefit of the robot for prostate cancer treatment relative to non-robotic surgery is quite limited. The available studies largely post-date the bulk of adoption (Sandoval Salinas et al., 2013, Yaxley et al., 2016, Ilic et al., 2017). The lack of direct financial incentive and trial evidence of clinical benefit points to the potential for hospitals to adopt surgical robots as a quality signal to patients or physicians. Third, Medicare patients are largely protected from the costs of intervention, and so out-of-pocket costs should play little role in the decision to initiate surgery with or without the robot. Finally, robots are sufficiently new that we observe hospital adoption and the universe of Original Medicare prostate cancer patients starting from initial FDA approval.====This study contributes to the literature in three key ways. First, we add to the evidence on the efficiency of technology diffusion in the health care sector. The most relevant prior studies have debated the potential for a socially wasteful medical arms race in which hospitals compete for patients by providing care of questionable value and acquiring costly technologically-advanced equipment (Feldstein, 1971, Robinson and Luft, 1985, Dranove et al., 1992, Devers et al., 2003, Kessler and McClellan, 2000, Trinh et al., 2008). This research is related to the concept that free entry can lead to social inefficiencies through business stealing (Mankiw and Whinston, 1986). As we show, adoption of surgical robots leads to business stealing as well as market expansion, which the literature would interpret as a signpost of an arms race — though the presence of market expansion rules out that adoption was wholly the result of such a phenomenon.====Relatedly, the volume increases we find confirm prior health services research that robotic surgery diffused steadily across many procedures (Juo et al., 2018, Shen and Tina Shih, 2016). After hospitals adopt robotic surgery, they tend to switch to robotic modalities for a host of procedures (Sheetz et al., 2020). Studies have pointed to regional competition as a key determinant of hospital adoption of robotics (Barbash et al., 2014, Wright et al., 2016). Still, the welfare impacts of technology adoption depend on the costs and benefits of the technology for patients who use it at the margin. Our finding that the patients who are induced to get treatment due to the robot are younger and healthier suggests that the worst fears for social inefficiencies were not realized. However, combining our results with clinical literature finding minimal benefits of the robot for patient outcomes calls into question whether this adoption was socially beneficial. This result echoes clinical literature that has looked skeptically on the cost and safety benefits of robotics (Childers and Maggard-Gibbons, 2018, Parsons et al., 2014, Khorgami et al., 2019).====These results also relate to research on productivity variations in the health care sector. Much of this work has focused on the adoption of evidence-based, low-cost technologies like ==== blockers in the treatment of heart attacks (Skinner and Staiger, 2007, Chandra and Staiger, 2007). Disparities in the use of these technologies are hypothesized to be a key determinant of productivity variations across regions (Baicker and Chandra, 2004, Skinner and Staiger, 2015). The benefits of adopting costly, high-tech equipment for the efficiency of the sector are more equivocal as, for example, Cutler et al. (2010) shows in the case of coronary bypass surgery for heart attacks. We add new evidence on the adoption of costly technology with few ==== restrictions on adoption and even less evidence backing its use. As we show, the surgical robot drove large volumes of patients to the hospital even as its clinical value remained unsubstantiated.====Finally, our work connects research on demand responses to quality information with the literature on hospital market responses to technology adoption. One piece of conventional wisdom suggests that unique characteristics of the health care market, such as the lack of accurate quality information and the prevalence of insurance coverage, dampens demand-side competition and gives providers little incentive to innovate (Cutler et al., 2010, Skinner, 2011). More recent studies challenge this view and show evidence that the allocation of patient volume across hospitals does respond to quality (Chandra et al., 2016). Recent developments in health care markets like increased public reporting of patient outcomes may make the demand response to quality, or perceived quality, even stronger. The strong volume increases we see in response to adoption demonstrate that there can be strong demand-side competition in health care. If patients and their agents view hospitals that have adopted the robot as higher quality and thus more preferable, adoption will lead to increases patient volume like what we find in the current study. This robust response to adoption has been found in technologies relating to treatments for cardiovascular disease, but the magnitude is not as stark as what we have found here (Hodgkin, 1996, Grossman and Banks, 1998).====The paper continues as follows: Section 2 provides background on robotic surgery devices and prostate cancer.

We calculate an e-cigarette own-price elasticity of -2.2 and particularly large elasticity of demand for flavored e-cigarettes. Further, we document a cigarette own-price elasticity of -0.4 and positive cross-price elasticities of demand between e-cigarettes and cigarettes, suggesting economic substitution.","In 2019, 4.5% of adults and 32.9% of high school students in the United States used electronic cigarettes (‘e-cigarettes’), and a third of these students used e-cigarettes on 20 or more days out of the past 30 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020a, 2020b). The rapid rise in vaping, particularly among youth, has led to concerns among public health officials and a focus on tobacco control policies aimed at curbing e-cigarette use. As of June 2022, 30 states and Washington DC have enacted an e-cigarette tax (Public Health Law Center, 2022).====In this paper, we provide evidence of the effects of e-cigarette taxes on the prices and sales of e-cigarettes and other tobacco products using the NielsenIQ Retail Scanner Dataset (NRSD) over the years 2013 to 2019. The NRSD tracks weekly sales of a national panel of retailers and covers a large percentage of total sales among drug stores, mass merchandisers, food stores, dollar stores, and club stores.==== Utilizing these data, this paper is among the first to estimate the pass-through rate for e-cigarette taxes, as well as own and cross-price elasticities between e-cigarettes and cigarettes. Further, utilizing a 98.1% match of e-cigarette sales to e-cigarette characteristics by Universal Product Codes (UPC), we estimate elasticities across heterogenous e-cigarette flavors and other measures of e-cigarette sales composition.====Recent theoretical work on the demand for nicotine motivates our findings for own- and cross-price elasticities of demand. In particular, Lillard (2020) develops a model suggesting that the demand for tobacco products is a derived demand based on the demand for nicotine. The choice of products is determined by the shadow price of nicotine, which is driven by the cost of the product, the efficiency of nicotine delivery, and the health and social effects of different products. Depending on these factors, different categories of nicotine products could theoretically be complements or substitutes.====We first estimate the pass-through rate of e-cigarette and cigarettes tax rates to e-cigarette prices. Our paper utilizes recently developed standardized e-cigarette taxes from Cotti et al. (2021), which compensates for substantial heterogeneity both in how e-cigarette taxes are levied and in the level of the tax. We find that e-cigarette taxes are almost fully passed through to consumer retail prices. Specifically, we estimate that a $1.00 increase in e-cigarette taxes raises e-cigarette prices by $0.90. We do not find significant pass-through effects of cigarette tax increases on the prices of e-cigarettes.====Next, we estimate reduced-form models of the effects of e-cigarette and cigarette taxes on sales of each product, and then use taxes as instruments to examine the own- and cross-price elasticities of demand for e-cigarettes and cigarettes. Estimates suggest an e-cigarette own-price elasticity of demand of -2.2, and approximately twice as elastic of demand for non-mentholated flavored e-cigarettes compared to non-flavored and mentholated e-cigarettes. These results are consistent with younger e-cigarette users – who are perhaps more price sensitive than older e-cigarette users due to their relatively low incomes – being more likely to use flavored e-cigarettes.====We find a cigarette own-price elasticity of -0.4, similar to previous studies (for reviews, see Chaloupka and Warner 2000, DeCicca et al. 2018, and DeCicca et al. 2020). Finally, we find evidence that cigarettes and e-cigarettes are economic substitutes (cigarette cross-price elasticity = 1.1; e-cigarette cross-price elasticity = 0.4), though only the latter is statistically significant.",The effects of e-cigarette taxes on e-cigarette prices and tobacco product sales: Evidence from retail panel data,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629622000911,5 September 2022,2022,Research Article,44.0

To this end, I use panel data to track the same individuals before and after the trauma. My results reveal that experiencing trauma increases individuals’ purchases of insurance, and in particular supplementary health and long-term care insurance. Investigating the mechanisms behind the results, I find that people become more future-oriented after someone close to them was in danger of physical injury during that military operation. However, I cannot completely rule out other causes such as an increase in risk ==== or changes in individuals’ beliefs.","Violence affects civilians in different ways at different times. In the fifteen years prior to 2016, Europe endured over 2,000 terror attacks.==== The U.S. experienced a traumatic terror incident on September 11, 2001, and 317 mass shootings throughout the U.S. between 1999 and 2013 left thousands of civilians injured or dead (Krouse and Richardson, 2015).==== America's involvement in wars in Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq are only a few examples of the armed conflicts that affected or affect U.S. civilians either directly or through the loss of loved ones.====The impact of trauma on individuals’ behavior is not clear. Following trauma, some people seem to believe they can no longer control their lives and environment and may refrain from taking actions or making decisions (Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, 2014), such as by neglecting preventive health care. Others try to cope with adverse life experiences by purchasing life insurance, for example (Belluci et al. 2020).====Close acquaintance with a person who was in mortal danger in a terror attack or in war may trigger post-traumatic stress (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) that may result in changes in the individual's behavior and preferences.====The current study explores how a trauma caused by knowing that a close acquaintance was in danger during a military operation (hereinafter: trauma) affects insurance purchasing.==== ==== The study then investigates several possible mechanisms that may elicit that result: the increased insurance purchases could stem from the individuals’ subjective beliefs about the probability of an adverse outcome occurring (classical models in economics); or from the individuals’ changes in risk or time preferences following armed conflicts (behavioral economics model).====Investigating whether war exposure affects individuals’ insurance purchases and preferences has implications for decision makers, who can provide assistance and insurance advice to the war-affected population. The research presented here is also important in preventing possible future collapses of insurance companies, which could be inundated by a sharp rise in insurance claims following wars or terror attacks (Kunreuther et al. 2003). Moreover, the traditional models in economics assume that individuals’ preferences are stable over their life cycle (Stigler and Becker, 1977). Thus, revealing whether preferences are altered following adverse incidents can be of interest to economics scholars as well.====Estimating the causal effect of trauma on behavior and preferences can be difficult for two main reasons: Researchers usually observe preferences after the fact, and since traumatic events usually affect specific populations, finding a comparable control group is difficult (Chuang and Schechter, 2015).====To overcome these challenges and discern the direction of the effect of trauma, this study tracks the same individuals before and after a military operation in which Israel participated, and employs a difference-in-differences methodology.====My findings are in line with the literature that examines the effect of traumatic events on insurance purchasing (e.g., Gallagher, 2014), and demonstrate that after exposure to a victim of a military operation, both the demand for supplementary health insurance and long-term care insurance increased by 16 percentage points. In contrast, there is no statistically significant increase in life insurance purchasing.====Investigating the mechanisms behind the results, I find that individuals value the future more after a trauma. Since individuals with a lower time preference (future-oriented individuals) invest more in health than others do (Ehrlich and Chuma, 1990), the rise in insurance purchases most likely stems from changes in these individuals’ time preferences (e.g., Bradford et al., 2017). However, I cannot completely rule out other mechanisms, such as changes in available information, an increase in risk aversion and a change in beliefs.====The results are unaffected by the inclusion or exclusion of several covariates: specifically, the individuals’ health conditions and earnings. This indicates that health impairments or decline in income after trauma are not the forces behind my findings.====Throughout the analysis, I strengthen the argument that people become more future-oriented following trauma, by showing that those who have a close acquaintance with someone who experienced mortal danger during the military operation are more likely to save more than those who do not. I also provide evidence that there were no pre-trauma trend differences in behavior between the treated and the control groups, suggesting that the true force behind my findings is indeed the trauma.====This study relates to the literature that examines how individuals’ preferences are affected by traumatic events caused by violence.==== Voors et al. (2012), using field experiments following the civil war in Burundi, find that individuals who experience violence are more pro-social, risk-seeking, and less patient in their actions; suggesting that the results may stem from changes in preferences.====Other studies find opposite results. Kim and Lee (2014), exploring how risk preferences are affected by an early-life traumatic event caused by the Korean civil war, find that those who were strongly exposed during childhood are more risk-averse than are others. Callen et al. (2014), after conducting several experiments in Afghanistan, report an increase in individuals’ preference for certainty after exposure to violence and controlled fearful recollections. Wang and Young (2016) demonstrate that aggregate flows to equity funds drop significantly after substantial terror attacks, indicating an increase in investors’ risk aversion. Moya (2018) finds that when individuals experience violent incidents, the more severe the violence, the greater the rise in the individuals’ risk aversion. Finally, Jakiela and Ozier (2019) find that individuals who experienced Kenya's post-election civil conflict became more risk-averse than individuals who did not experience that conflict.====The current study also relates to the literature on the effect of experience (e.g., traumatic events), on demand for insurance. Browne and Hoyt (2000) find that the probability of purchasing insurance increases after natural disasters. Gallagher (2014) shows that households buy more insurance after they or people in their surroundings experience a flood. Cole et al. (2014) show that in rural India, the probability of households’ buying insurance rises by 25–50 percent in places where insurance payouts occurred. According to Coe et al. (2015), people whose parents or in-laws use nursing homes buy more insurance than others do. Cai and Song (2017), simulating a hypothetical experience with disasters, find that farmers buy more insurance after such simulations. Finally, Bellucci et al. (2020) find that individuals who experienced war episodes during childhood are more likely than others to buy life insurance later in life.====The current study contributes to the aforementioned literature in several ways. The classical models in economics assume that individuals alter their behavior only in response to changes in incentives and constraints, and maintain stable preferences over time (Stigler and Becker, 1977; Schildberg-Hörisch, 2018). Therefore, determining whether trauma affects individuals’ time preferences and behavior makes an important contribution to economic theory. Moreover, this research also explores other factors that may shape individuals’ behavior (e.g., risk preferences and beliefs) following trauma. In addition, the datasets and econometric strategy enabled me to track the same individuals before and after the military operation, controlling for individual fixed characteristics—a possibility that is rather uncommon in the aforementioned literature. Since wars occur globally, the way individuals in one developed country modify their behavior in response to violent attacks and the mechanisms that underlie this behavior may be relevant to other developed countries for the purposes of insurance guidance, advice, and policies. The research findings can also be relevant to scholars and decision makers who explore how other traumatic events following catastrophes, natural disasters or accidents, affect individuals’ preferences and insurance purchasing. The main contribution of this paper is therefore its public policy implications.====The analysis proceeds as follows: Section 2 describes how individuals’ experiences may affect insurance purchasing, according to the classical economics models versus the behavioral economics models; Section 3 describes the Israeli military operation in the Gaza Strip in 2014; Section 4 presents the dataset; and Section 5 outlines the econometric specification; the results are presented in Section 6; Section 7 discusses the possible mechanisms; placebo and robustness checks follow in Section 8; and Section 9 presents the conclusions.","Out of time?

We find that state-level parity law reduces youth suicide rate and propensity to report any poor mental health day, increases college GPA, and does not change the propensity to disenroll from college.","Mental illnesses are widespread worldwide, in both developed and developing countries (World Health Organization, 2018b). Moreover, mental illnesses account for a larger proportion of disability in developed countries than any other group of illnesses, including cancer and heart disease (Reeves et al., 2011). In the U.S., approximately one in five adults live with mental illness. 18.3% of U.S. adults experienced some form of mental illness in 2016. Younger adults (ages 18 to 25 years) experience a higher prevalence of mental illness (22.1% in 2016) compared to older adults (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2017). Moreover, mental illnesses are widespread among college students. For instance, in fall 2017, approximately 40% of college students reported that they experienced depressive symptoms which adversely affected their well-being in the last year (American College Health Association, 2018b; Ibrahim et al., 2013).==== For individuals in school, mental illnesses have adverse effects on their educational performances (Bilodeau and Meissner, 2016; Cornaglia et al., 2015; Currie and Stabile, 2006; Kessler et al., 1995). Further, individuals with mental illnesses face disproportionate barriers in attending school and finding employment and are more likely to die prematurely (World Health Organization, 2018a).====The widespread presence of mental illnesses in the U.S. is troubling from a social policy perspective as social costs of these illnesses are incurred through decreased labor supply, increased public support payments, reduced educational attainment, declined life expectancy (a loss of 13 to 32 years), and increased costs associated with other consequences such as incarceration or homelessness (Insel, 2008). In particular, mental illnesses cost the U.S. economy US$519.5B in healthcare expenditures, disability payments, and a less productive workforce (Insel, 2015).====The private costs of mental healthcare services are non-trivial. The key barriers to receiving mental healthcare treatment are lack of insurance and inability to pay for treatment (Kessler et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2002). In particular, mental illness treatments are costly for an uninsured patient: mental healthcare provider reimbursement rates can range from US$67 to US$144 per visit (Mark et al., 2017). These costs place a greater burden on individuals who may require a continuum of treatments on their pathway to recovery from mental illness. Due to these barriers to treatment, despite the effectiveness of mental illness treatments, the majority of individuals with mental illnesses do not receive treatment. Moreover, Zivin et al. (2009) find that while the majority of students with probable mental illnesses are aware of the need for treatment, most of these students do not receive treatment.====Given that lack of insurance is a commonly cited barrier to receiving mental healthcare treatment, insurance coverage should increase the affordability of mental healthcare treatments and, in turn, increase utilization of these treatments (Grossman, 1972; Kessler et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2002). However, historically, in the U.S., private insurance coverage for mental illness treatments has been less generous than benefits for general medical treatments due to concerns about the large demand elasticity for mental healthcare services (McGuire and Montgomery, 1982). For example, benefits for mental healthcare commonly include higher cost-sharing, lower annual outpatient visits and inpatient day limits, and other non-quantitative means (e.g., use of prior authorization and stepped therapy) (Busch and Barry, 2008; U.S. General Accountability Office, 2000).====To improve insurance coverage of mental health services and increase access to mental health services, state mental illness parity laws were implemented in many states in the U.S. in the late 1990s and 2000s. These laws require private insurance companies to include mental health benefits under the same terms and conditions as physical health benefits. Previous research finds that these laws have effectively increased the use of mental healthcare services, reduced the suicide rate, and improved labor market outcomes (Andersen, 2015; Busch and Barry, 2008; Lang, 2013).====Our study extends the literature on state-level mental illness parity laws in several ways. We focus on younger adults, the population most likely to suffer from mental illnesses. We study the effect of state-level mental illness parity laws on mental illness among the college-aged population, as the early onset of mental illnesses can result in a trajectory of adverse academic, occupational, health, and social outcomes. We also examine the effects of state-level mental illness parity laws on educational outcomes of college students (grade point average and decision to disenroll from school) as mental illnesses are widespread among college students and could affect their academic performance. Understanding how mental illness parity laws affect human capital accumulation in college is vital for developing and maintaining a skilled workforce for the U.S. economy. In addition, academic success during college years affects future earnings and other labor market outcomes. Thus, examining the effect of state mental illness parity laws on educational outcomes could show an important spillover from public health policy to the U.S. labor markets. Finally, recent econometric literature on difference-in-differences (DD) analysis discusses important empirical concerns that are associated with the causal interpretation of the more commonly used two-way fixed effects models estimated to look at policies implemented at different times (Callaway and Sant'Anna, 2020; de Chaisemartin and D'Haultfœuille, 2020a, 2020b; Goodman-Bacon, 2021; Sun and Abraham, 2020). Therefore, we test the robustness of our key findings by additionally applying Callaway and Sant'Anna's (2021) approach specifically designed for staggered DD set ups. One of the key advantages of this new estimation procedure is that the model accounts for heterogeneity in treatment effects.====We use DD models to uncover the causal effects of state-level full parity mental illness laws on mental illness and educational outcomes. We couple DD models with both administrative and survey data and include state-level controls to account for between state heterogeneity. We leverage plausibly exogenous variation in private insurance coverage for mental healthcare using changes in state laws from 1998 to 2008. In particular, there were 24 law changes over this period, which offer substantial variation for the identification of DD models. This analysis proceeds in two steps. First, to study parity law effects on mental illness, we utilize administrative data on completed suicides from the Compressed Mortality File of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and survey data on reported poor mental health days from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Second, we use longitudinal data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 Cohort to examine the effects of mental illness parity laws on two important educational outcomes: grade point average (GPA) and the propensity to disenroll from college.====We have four principal findings. (i) Passage of a state-level full parity mental illness law leads to reductions in poor mental health days and suicide among the college-aged population. Post-law, the suicide rate decreases by 3.0%, and the propensity to report any poor mental health day in the last 30 days reduces by 1.8 percentage points. (ii) Passage of a state-level full parity mental illness law increases academic performance among college students; post-law the annual average GPA increases by 0.110 GPA points. (iii) The GPA effects are concentrated among female students. (iv) Passage of a state-level full parity mental illness law does not statistically significantly change the propensity to disenroll from college. These results can inform policymaker decisions about mental healthcare insurance laws for young adults.====This manuscript proceeds as follows: Section 2 describes the epidemiology of mental illness and state-level mental illness parity laws, summarizes the related literature, and outlines the conceptual framework that motivates our analysis.

In this paper, we study the health implications of Internet access with a specific focus on body weight. We exploit an Internet speed upgrading project in China and conduct a difference-in-differences analysis, where the ==== intensity depends on cities’ pre-existing Internet infrastructure conditions. We find consistent and robust evidence that increased Internet access reduces the incidence of being overweight. Regarding the mechanisms behind this result, we provide indirect evidence for the information channel, evidenced by improved health behaviors after the project: less engagement in risky health behaviors and increased participation in preventive health services and exercise. Internet diffusion also increases income, supporting the income channel through which the Internet can affect body weight.","Information revolution is an important feature of the twenty-first century as more and more people gain access to the Internet.==== A high proportion of Internet users search for health information online (Duggan and Fox, 2013). Although it is reasonable to assume that people would improve their health outcomes when they receive more information, the health implications of Internet access are unclear for several reasons. First, the quality of information may vary: accurate and timely information can improve health outcomes, but unreliable and even false information can be detrimental to health. Second, the health effects of receiving more information from the Internet may follow the law of diminishing returns, so the realized effects may depend on the initial stage of Internet development. Third, Internet diffusion can contribute to economic development and hence improve people’s overall standard of living, of which health is an important element. Therefore, the impact of the Internet on health is unclear and requires empirical analysis.====In this paper, we aim to examine whether increased Internet access changes health outcomes. Specifically, we focus on the impact of Internet diffusion on body weight because it is “a good gauge of [the] risk for diseases”, as stated by the National Institutes of Health. In addition, the prevalence of overweight and obesity has become a global problem: worldwide obesity has nearly tripled since 1975, and nearly 40 percent of adults aged 18 years and over were overweight in 2016. It is even more alarming that most of the world’s population lives in countries where overweight and obesity cause more deaths than underweight.====Potential endogeneity of Internet diffusion makes it difficult to examine the causal impact of Internet access on body weight: more developed regions tend to have better Internet access, and local economic development levels may be correlated with people’s body weight. We address this concern by studying a plausibly exogenous policy shock, the Internet speed upgrading project in China in 2000 and 2001, to proxy for increased Internet access. The identification strategy essentially hinges on the fact that cities with better pre-existing Internet infrastructure conditions were more intensively affected by the project. Therefore, we are able to conduct a difference-in-differences analysis, taking advantage of different levels of exposure to the project across cities, along with the comparison between pre- and post-shock periods.====The China context also provides an ideal opportunity to evaluate the effect of Internet diffusion on the overweight problem in developing countries. Over the past three decades, the overweight rate in China has been increasing, as shown in Fig. 1. It was only 11.7 percent in 1989 and reached 41.23 percent in 2015.==== Despite the overall upward trend, it is interesting to see that the overweight rate leveled off between 2000 and 2009, which coincides with a major period of Internet development in China.==== Given the access to more information and the potential economic benefits that come with the Internet, we ask the question: to what extent can we attribute the slowdown of the increase in the overweight rates to Internet diffusion? Understanding this question is important to public health research, especially in the context of developing countries, because (1) two-thirds of the world’s overweight population lives in developing countries now, and the overweight and obesity problem is becoming an epidemic in some regions,==== and (2) major non-communicable diseases and premature deaths associated with overweight/obesity status can result in a significant health expenditure burden, yet public health funding in developing countries is generally limited.==== Increasing Internet access could be a potential solution to this health crisis if it helps to slow down the growing trend of overweight rates.====Based on our difference-in-differences analysis of the Internet speed upgrading project, we find that Internet access decreases body weight in China: a 10 percent increase in the level of Internet diffusion leads to 1.62 percentage points decrease in the probability of being overweight. We further discuss two channels–the information channel and the income channel–through which the Internet can influence body weight. The main limitation of our approach to the information channel is that we do not directly observe people’s sources of information. Nevertheless, we show that the decline in body weight is accompanied by improved health behaviors, which may result from greater exposure to health knowledge and hence indirectly supports the information channel. We also provide suggestive evidence that people acquire information through the Internet rather than through other media, as shown by increased ownership of computers, which Internet access requires. On the income channel, we provide direct evidence that Internet diffusion improves people’s economic conditions. We also show that people with a high initial income level and those from more economically developed regions benefit more from increased Internet access in terms of weight control, which supports a positive health-income relationship.====Our paper fits into a large strand of literature on the socioeconomic impacts of Internet diffusion. Most previous studies have highlighted the positive effects of the Internet on economic growth (e.g. Czernich et al., 2011), firm performance (e.g. Chen et al., 2020), and labor market outcomes (e.g. Dettling, 2017). Internet access has also been linked with a range of social outcomes, such as increased marriage rates (Bellou, 2015), decreased teen pregnancy rates (Guldi and Herbst, 2017), more reports and charges of sex crimes (Bhuller et al., 2013), and changes in voter turnout (Falck et al., 2014). Recently, a growing body of literature begins to focus on the health implications of the Internet, which is shown to increase the demand for healthcare services (Suziedelyte, 2012, Amaral-Garcia et al., 2021), improve self-reported health status (Lam et al., 2020, Hunsaker et al., 2021), and affect psychological well-being (McDool et al., 2020). In particular, it is often thought that excessive Internet usage is a contributing factor to overweight and obesity prevalence (Aghasi et al., 2020). Yet, the discussion on the effect of general Internet development on body weight remains scarce. A closely related paper that we are aware of is by DiNardi et al. (2019), who use the rollout of Internet providers during the 2000s in the US as a plausibly exogenous source of variation in Internet access to study its effect on body weight. They find that Internet diffusion significantly increases the probability of being obese among white women but does not affect body weight for men and non-white women. Related to this study, we provide novel evidence on the effect of Internet access on body weight from China, the largest developing economy in the world, and further the discussion on the mechanisms. Different from the results of DiNardi et al. (2019), we find that increased Internet access reduces the probability of being overweight. We argue that this difference can be explained by the different stages of economic and Internet development between the two countries. Specifically, we focus on a period when the Internet became increasingly accessible in China, while the US context studied by DiNardi et al. (2019) is already featured a high level of Internet diffusion.====This study also contributes to the literature on the contextual causes of overweight and obesity prevalence. Many studies try to link obesity with the decline in the monetary and time costs of food, although the evidence is mixed (Currie et al., 2010, Dunn, 2010, Courtemanche and Carden, 2011, Cotti and Tefft, 2013). Macroeconomic conditions are another contextual factor that may contribute to obesity, mainly through the channel of declines in income and employment opportunities.

A method based on utility theory produces the most robust and accurate results, while alternative methods used in recent work overstate ====. Based on Medicare claims data for three medical conditions, we find declining prices across each condition when properly adjusted for quality.","High growth in health care spending has been a characteristic of the health care sector in the U.S. and other developed countries for decades, although it is often argued that the higher spending growth also leads to improved health outcomes (Chernew and Newhouse, 2011). The relationship between health and spending on medical care is a fundamental question of the field of health economics. Techniques measuring that relationship that are specific to the field such as cost-effectiveness analysis are useful for comparing the values of different treatments, but do not facilitate measurement of progress in the sector over time or comparison with other sectors of the economy. For those tasks, it is useful to turn to standard economic measurement concepts such as output, inflation, and productivity. Proper measurement of those concepts, however, requires accurate quality measurement, which can be difficult to carry out for the health care sector. Non-medical factors (e.g., pollution) may influence health outcomes and it can be challenging to accurately attribute changes in the health of the population to changes in the medical care sector. Price measurement in medical care is further complicated by the rapid pace of technological change, third-party payers, and information asymmetries among other factors (Hall 2016; Sheiner and Malinovskaya 2016).====Some researchers have constructed quality-adjusted price indexes for a few select medical conditions (Cutler et al. 1998; Berndt et al. 2002; Frank et al. 2004 among others). Their work suggests that inflation has been greatly overstated and growth in productivity and real output have been greatly understated. However, two recent literature reviews summarizing the work in this area found that the papers were not consistent with each other in their approaches and that there was no clear consensus on how to approach the issue (Hall 2016; Sheiner and Malinovskaya 2016).====In this paper, we provide a framework relating the different methods previously used in the literature, we illustrate the differences between them empirically, and we demonstrate that price declines are still found in a later time period and across three conditions. The main contribution of this paper is that it shows that the method used to construct quality adjusted price indexes matters both theoretically and empirically. Specifically, we show that both the theoretical and empirical differences across methods have substantial implications for measurement in this sector. We also show that a utility-based index is the preferred methodology for most applications.====The methods we compare are: (1) a utility-based cost-of-living index (COLI) following Cutler et al. (1998); (2) an index measuring the price per unit of health produced from treatment; (3) a hedonic index; and (4) an index based on the cost of producing the change in quality. The work by Sheiner and Malinovskaya (2016) put a spotlight on these methodologies and laid the groundwork here as they showed how these approaches previously used in the literature related to each other. We build and expand on their ideas.====The utility-based COLI method of Cutler et al. (1998) is our benchmark method because it is grounded in utility theory and it is robust to market distortions common in health care markets (e.g., moral hazard, adverse selection, and information asymmetry). The quality change is obtained from a consumer utility problem using compensating variation, which results in assigning a value to improvements in health from medical care based on the dollar value that consumers place on improvements in health. We show that the utility-based COLI produces accurate estimates even when the use of health care is not optimal. The question to be addressed is whether the other methods produce similar results or have other distinguishing properties. We show that the second method of measuring price per unit of health is only consistent with our benchmark when consumers are optimizing and there is a linear relationship between the health produced and dollars spent on treatment (i.e., a constant average price for health). We argue that this linear relationship is not realistic and that diminishing returns to health inputs is the more likely scenario, so the marginal price of health will greatly exceed the average price. Consequently, the second method that values health improvements at the average price tends to undervalue changes in quality. Researchers interested in measuring the price of improvements in health should target the marginal price of health improvement, and not the average price.====In any scenario, researchers should be careful in using any prices (marginal prices or average prices) to value improvements in health outcomes, as health care markets tends to have distortions that could lead the price of improving health to be either too high or too low. Moreover, there may be hard technological constraints (i.e., a point where additional medical care provides no health benefit), as highlighted by Sheiner and Malinovskaya (2016), so it may not be possible to purchase any additional units of health at prevailing prices. The other two methods also deliver higher price growth than our benchmark utility-based method because they both use changes in spending and costs as proxies for the value of changes in improvements in health. As we will show, however, typically the high valuation put on health and longer life imply that the increases in spending are well below the patient's valuation of improved medical technology.====Our analysis is distinct from Sheiner and Malinovskaya (2016) as we emphasize how the utility-based method is robust to market distortions and show how the utility-based COLI and price per unit of health may be different, even if there are no technological constraints. Finally, we also demonstrate how the marginal price of health care may be a meaningful economic measure of the value of health (to producers of health), even if it is not the correct measure from a consumer's or societal perspective.====After reviewing the theoretical differences, we apply alternative methods to estimate price indexes to claims data. We study three acute conditions among Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) patients for the years 2001–2014: acute myocardial infarction (AMI), congestive heart failure (CHF), and pneumonia. The average expenditure per treatment for these conditions rose faster than general inflation, having an average excess growth rate of around 1 percent per year. However, treatments for these conditions also showed significant improvements in health outcomes as measured by post-hospitalization life expectancy. We find strong evidence that quality adjustment is important, with quality-adjusted indexes growing less than the unadjusted indexes even under the most conservative assumptions, highlighting the importance of quality adjustment.====As expected from our theoretical model, we find that our preferred utility-based COLI price index tends to fall much faster than other quality-adjustment methods because it is the only method that accounts for the full value of improvements in health. Overall the results of the utility-based method show that the average price across the three conditions declined by 7.4 percent per year relative to an economy-wide deflator and based on the value of a statistical life year of $100,000. We find that the magnitude of the decline is highly dependent on the assumption about the value of extended life, but we estimate that the average price still fell annually by 3.1 percent, even when making the conservative assumption that the value of a statistical life year is worth $50,000.====In summary, a utility-based index is our preferred index because it is both theoretically grounded and robust to market distortions that appear to be prevalent in health care markets. We show that the utility-based price index generally values improvements in health more than the other alternatives, and also leads to more rapid price declines when the quality of treatments improve. However, we also find that the utility-based indexes are especially sensitive to some key assumptions, such as the value of a statistical life year, so it may be important to report a range of estimates. The non-utility based indexes may be useful and easier to apply in some cases, such as when information on life expectancy from treatment is difficult to measure, but we show that researchers should be cautious when applying these alternatives, since the bias could be substantial.",A systematic examination of quality-adjusted price index alternatives for medical care using claims data,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629622000819,7 August 2022,2022,Research Article,48.0

For example, the costs of a lower-limb MRI vary by a factor of twelve across the country and roughly two-fold within hospital referral regions (Cooper et al. 2019). Given the disconnect between charge prices, negotiated rates, and out-of-pocket prices, it is perhaps not surprising that medical prices exhibit such dispersion. Insured consumers often have little incentive to shop around for providers, blunting standard market forces that would otherwise help promote price competition among providers. In response to this issue, insurers and policymakers have increasingly embraced incentives that motivate consumers to take a more active role in their health care consumption. Many recent insurance designs in this spirit, such as high-deductible health plans (HDHPs), tiered networks, and reference pricing, try to improve consumers’ incentives to make cost-effective decisions regarding their health care. The hope is that such incentive structures will bring down expenditures both directly, via a shift in demand toward low-cost providers, and indirectly, through the impact of increased competition on the equilibrium distribution of prices. While HDHPs appear to have gained the most traction among these new consumer-focused designs, the bulk of the evidence thus far suggests that this design fails to induce a meaningful degree of price shopping among consumers (Brot-Goldberg et al., 2017).==== That is, these plans tend to lead to an outright reduction in utilization (the extensive margin), as opposed to a shift in demand toward cheaper providers (the intensive margin).====In this paper, I study the demand-side effects of tiered cost sharing, an innovative incentive structure designed to steer consumers toward low-cost providers using large out-of-pocket price differentials. Tiered plans have the potential to improve upon HDHPs and other designs by mediating prices and demand more effectively, thereby generating a better balance between consumer surplus and costs. My analysis is based on administrative data from New Hampshire, where two of the largest insurers employ tiered incentives to cover common outpatient procedures. Using this data, I produce new evidence on the effects of tiered pricing on choices and spending. Moreover, I develop and utilize a framework to compare the tiered design to other cost sharing mechanisms, and to shed light on the most effective implementation of the tiered concept.====I first present reduced-form evidence on the effectiveness of these plans by exploiting the rollout of Anthem New Hampshire’s Site of Service tiered cost-sharing feature in a difference-in-differences design. I find that this tiered program reduced mean spending on colonoscopies and upper gastrointestinal endoscopies by 4.8%–6.3% in the treated group. In this design, contracted prices with the insurer are the same across the treated and control groups, implying that savings are generated through the demand side. Importantly, I also apply this framework to assess the impact on the extensive margin, where I find that the tiered plan did not affect the likelihood of obtaining a procedure in a particular year.====To better understand the source of these savings and to model potential improvements in plan design, I develop and estimate a discrete choice demand model to explicitly compare different specification of the tiered design as well as to compare the tiered design with traditional deductible and coinsurance-based designs. Estimation of this model relies on variation in out-of-pocket costs across providers, plans, and time, which is substantial. Motivated by the finding of Prager (2020) that patients may respond differently to tiered copayments than to coinsurance when choosing a provider, I allow price responsiveness to vary between patients in tiered plans and patients in traditional plans.====The demand estimates indicate that patients in tiered plans respond non-negligibly to out-of-pocket price variation, with an estimated elasticity of −0.39. Conversely, patients in more-traditional deductible and coinsurance-based plans exhibit effectively zero price responsiveness. Along with Prager (2020) these results lend support to the notion of a salience or “simple pricing” effect whereby patients respond to out-of-pocket price variation only when such prices are clear and simple. My counterfactual estimates suggest that, in addition to being clear and simple, out-of-pocket price differences must be large in order to meaningfully impact demand.====I estimate all models using detailed administrative data from the New Hampshire all-payer claims database covering 2006–2016. I focus my analysis here specifically on gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures, as these make up a sizable fraction of outpatient spending and are quite plausibly amenable to price-shopping. The data contain comprehensive information on the insurer, provider, and patient involved in each claim. Moreover, these data capture the changing composition of plan characteristics and provider prices over time and across multiple insurers. This information allows me to construct an elaborate picture of the financial incentives facing patients during each choice situation. Altogether, the rich detail, size, and variation in this data enables me to estimate demand precisely and lends credibility to counterfactual simulations.",Tiered cost sharing and health care demand,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629622000807,6 August 2022,2022,Research Article,49.0

Using a large panel of orthopaedic surgeons in England, I estimate the effect of surgeons’ breaks, measured by the number of days since their last surgery, on the health outcomes of emergency ==== fixed. Overall, these findings show that the organisation of surgeons’ activity is a possible determinant of the quality of care provided.","Work schedules and duration of shifts can affect workers’ performance (Lazear and Shaw, 2007, Collewet and Sauermann, 2017). In addition, breaks from practice can impact workers’ productivity in different possible ways. On the one hand, regular breaks can be beneficial for workers’ mental well-being, physical health or safety (Spurgeon, 2003), explaining why most national and international labour regulations mandate regular rest periods.==== Regular breaks may also improve workers’ performance by reducing decision fatigue. The psychological literature has shown that repeated decisions being made in a row can lead to worse judgement making by judges, voters or healthcare workers (Danziger et al., 2011, Flinn and Armstrong, 2011, Augenblick and Nicholson, 2016, Hunt et al., 2021). Nurses and doctors appear to take more conservative or less appropriate clinical decisions as the day passes (Linder et al., 2014, Allan et al., 2019).====On the other hand, breaks may negatively impact workers’ performance if performance benefits from repeated practice (i.e., learning-by-doing) (Besanko et al., 2010, Ho, 2014). Further, tasks that require coordination within a team may be impacted by breaks from practice as the experience of working in a team depreciates (Reagans et al., 2005, Chan, 2016, Chen, 2021). Empirically, breaks in activity induced by drops in production levels have been shown to affect worker productivity across a variety of production settings, such as franchise shops, assembly lines, aircraft or ship production (Argote and Epple, 1990, Darr et al., 1995, Benkard, 2000, Shafer et al., 2001, Thompson, 2007), though the effect varies across sectors.====This paper explores whether surgeons’ breaks from practice, defined as the number of days since their last surgery, have a causal impact on 30-day mortality rates after hip fracture surgery. To this end, I construct a panel of over 2000 orthopaedic surgeons in the English National Health Service (2009–2016). Hip fracture is the most common reason for admission into emergency orthopaedic wards, with around 70,000 to 75,000 hip fractures occurring annually in the United Kingdom (National Clinical Guidelines Centre, 2011 p.6). Post-surgical mortality is high, at around seven percent one month after hip fracture in 2017 (Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership, 2018), suggesting potential for improvement at the aggregate level given the high incidence of hip fractures.====To mitigate concerns of endogeneity linked to surgeon selection, I estimate a fixed effects model where surgeon fixed effects allow for unobserved time-invariant heterogeneity in surgeon ability. Interacted hospital-year fixed effects further control for fully flexible hospital-specific time trends in health outcomes over the sample period. Results show that, for breaks between four and six days, average 30-day mortality rates decrease by about six percent (around 0.4 percentage points), compared to surgeons who were in the operating room the day before.====Only few studies have explicitly modelled the effect of breaks from surgical practice on quality of care. In a study on a cardiac procedure (transcatheter aortic valve implantations, TAVI) for one Belgian hospital, Van Gestel et al. (2017) find no effect of breaks from practice on 24-month mortality. They however estimate that an additional day between TAVI practices is associated with a higher probability of adverse events (renal failure and stroke) but indicate that this effect is driven by the most extreme values of breaks, i.e. above 100 days. Using a panel data on trauma-related ambulance runs in the US, David and Brachet (2011) find evidence of skill decay among paramedics, showing that additional days of inactivity adversely impact paramedics’ performance, measured by ambulances’ out-of-hospital time. Fluctuations in performance measured at the hospital or team level may however also arise from staff turnover, therefore confounding the effect of breaks for individual surgeons (David and Brachet, 2011).====The sparse evidence available to date on the effect of breaks from practice for individual surgeons has focused on cardiac procedures. Hockenberry and Helmchen (2014) use data for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in the United States and find that an additional day away from the operating room raises in-hospital mortality by 2.4%. Hockenberry et al. (2008) find similar strong negative effect of breaks for CABG in Taiwan, indicating that the one-month likelihood of death after CABG is 17% higher for surgeons after a 3–14 day break relative to a 0–2 day break. However, Huesch (2014), using U.S. data, compares patient outcomes for cardiac surgeons who have performed a CABG in the previous month and those who have not, and finds no association with post-surgical length of stay or mortality.====There is limited evidence on the potential mechanisms behind the effect of time between surgeries on health outcomes. Previous studies have interpreted the adverse effect of breaks on patient health outcomes as evidence of depreciation of surgical skills. Hockenberry and Helmchen (2014) find that breaks both increase patient mortality and reduce hospitalisation costs, which they suggest indicates that surgeons’ lower performance after breaks is due to inattention and insufficient care being provided. Hockenberry et al. (2008) test whether the level of task repetition prior to the break, measured by the volume of activity prior to the break, may explain the adverse effect but find little evidence of this. David and Brachet (2011)’s findings suggest that overall work inactivity and tasks interference (i.e. performing a large range of tasks) contribute to paramedics’ lower performance, measured by out-of-hospital ambulance time, but do not investigate the impact on patient outcomes.====This study makes several contributions to the literature on the effect of breaks from practice on patient health outcomes. First, in most settings, breaks are not exogenously determined. Changes in practice are likely to respond to changes in performance, resulting in a reverse causality bias. Surgeons who become worse at treating patients may take breaks more often, which will introduce a spurious negative relationship between surgical ability and breaks length. Following David and Brachet (2011), this endogeneity concern is mitigated by focusing on an emergency condition.==== Patients break their proximal femur, often after a fall, and need to be treated within 48 h of admission to the hospital (National Clinical Guidelines Centre, 2011). Variation in surgeons’ break duration is driven by unanticipated emergency admissions in pre-determined schedules, and thus arguably exogenous conditional on the large set of controls.====Second, this study adds to the understanding of the effect of breaks on performance, by testing for heterogeneity in the effect of breaks along different dimensions of surgical practice. Orthopaedic surgeons tend to perform a range of bone-related surgeries, from hips to knees, ankles or upper limbs. Heterogeneity analyses indicate that the effect of breaks may be more important for surgeons with less experience in hip fracture care, as measured by their annual volume of hip fracture patients, but is not affected by surgeons’ degree of specialisation in hip fracture care. In addition, I investigate potential mechanisms behind the effect of breaks. I find no evidence that surgeon skills deteriorate with breaks as was suggested in previous studies for cardiac procedures. Allowing breaks to be task-specific, thereby measuring the effect of the number of days since last hip fracture surgery and excluding related orthopaedic surgical activity, does not change the overall results: breaks in hip fracture activity, like general breaks, have a null or positive effect on patient health outcomes.====Further, I explore whether surgeons who return to the operating ward after a break choose a different type of surgery (namely, total/partial hip replacement versus reduction or internal fixation of hip fracture using nails or screws), controlling for patient characteristics and the type of fracture. If the choice of surgery type explains the effect of breaks, specific treatment can be enforced by stricter enforcement of clinical guidelines (Chowdhury et al., 2007). Findings show that short breaks also impact the type of surgery carried out, holding patient characteristics fixed, by decreasing the probability of receiving a full or partial hip replacement surgery (i.e. increasing the probability of fracture reduction using nails or screws). Importantly, I provide some evidence that these changes in treatment choices are not due to differences in the type of patients treated after a break, but rather point to differences in surgeons’ decision after a break. This suggests that better patient outcomes could be explained by a more appropriate choice of treatment, potentially permitted by less decision fatigue.====The rest of this paper is structured as follows.

It is also clear that health care workers are aware of, and concerned about, this risk (====, ====, ====).==== Might health care providers attempt to compensate for this risk in ways that are relevant for policy? For example, might they change how they interact with patients to reduce exposure? Such changes might occur on the extensive margin, e.g., by reducing in-person contacts with patients or, more subtly, on the intensive margin by changing the nature of the interaction itself.====).====, ====), which helped to reduce risk to health care workers from in-person contacts, telemedicine continues to be vastly under-utilized in developing countries (====). The developing country context is important for another reason: these are settings that were already characterized by low levels of quality even prior to the pandemic (====, ====. I have data on more than 5000 such encounters that took place between January 2019 and November 2020. The data come from interviews conducted with patients and caregivers, on-site, shortly after the encounter. I observe various measures of the quality of the interaction including whether the attending provider asked questions recommended by clinical guidelines, whether they performed various routine/diagnostic procedures such as performing a physical examination, and whether they provided relevant health information to the patient at the end of the visit. In addition to the fixed effects approach, I also use an alternative double-difference strategy. As there is no contemporaneous unexposed group, I define exposed and unexposed encounters based on whether they occurred before or after the start of the pandemic. Specifically, encounters between January and March 2020 are defined as unexposed, and encounters between April and November 2020 are defined as exposed. I then calculate the change between exposed and unexposed encounters in 2020 (first difference) and take a second difference over the same change in 2019, the comparator period.====Both models produce similar results. I find that the quality of routine health care interactions significantly deteriorated during the first phase of the pandemic. Based on the most conservative model estimates: health worker adherence to clinical history-taking guidelines decreased by about 15%, physical examinations decreased by about 33%, blood pressure checks decreased by 50%, and examinations with a stethoscope decreased by about 30%. The quality of provider–patient communication also deteriorated: patients were 32% less likely to be told what their diagnosis was and 31% less likely to receive any health education related to their diagnosis. These large differences remain even after controlling for patient ==== and clinical characteristics.==== However, if health care workers cannot easily identify patients that are infected – none of these health centers had the capability for Covid testing – they will apply a broad brush.====I start by showing that health workers were very worried about getting infected: when asked how worried they were on a scale from 0–10, 1 in 5 workers chose the maximum score 10. I also present evidence that some health centers stopped providing care to patients with symptoms associated with Covid-19; behavior that is suggestive of risk mitigation on the extensive margin. Health workers not willing (or unable) to turn away patients might attempt to reduce risk of exposure by reducing the duration and intensity of contact with sick patients, i.e., an intensive margin response. The effects observed – health workers asking fewer questions, providing less health information, and reducing use of procedures like physical examinations that require close contact with patients – are suggestive of intensive margin risk reduction.====To put this on a firmer footing, I devise two tests. The first test is motivated by two related facts: (i) health workers cannot readily identify who is infected, and (ii) exposure risk increases with the fraction of patients that are likely to be infected. This suggests that risk mitigation will be more likely, and thus the negative effects on quality more pronounced, when health workers are faced by patients they believe are more likely to be infected. In a survey administered to health workers in the sample, fever and cough were the two symptoms most commonly associated with Covid-19 infection. Consistent with risk mitigation I find more pronounced negative effects when patients present with these symptoms.====The main idea behind the second test is that patient screening (turning away suspicious patients) reduces the need for other Covid precautions. An illustration is with ====. To reduce the risk of getting malaria, one can screen out mosquitoes, literally, by using a mosquito net. If one can exclude all (or most) mosquitoes, then that reduces the need for additional costly precautions such as burning a mosquito coil or using a spray (both are costly not just because of the financial costs, but also because of usage costs: they produce a bad odor). The same intuition applies here: if healthcare workers can screen patients then it reduces the need for additional measures which are costly. I argue that this will map non-linearly to the level of worry about getting infected. When individuals are not as worried about the virus they will be less likely to take any precautions – a phenomenon observed in the US and elsewhere. On the other extreme, those who are most worried will be more likely to screen patients which reduces the need for other precautions. This suggests that the most pronounced changes in quality will be seen at moderate levels of worry. I find evidence in line with this.====I examine and find little support for alternative explanations. I show that the results cannot be explained by changes in health worker composition: a health worker fixed effects specification produces similar results. Data on Covid case numbers in Nigeria casts some doubt on a second explanation: increased healthcare provider workloads/burdens during the pandemic. The idea being that overworked, fatigued providers might provide worse care (====). As of November 2020, the end of my data series, Nigeria had recorded 67,412 confirmed cases and 1,173 deaths in a country of over 200 million people (====).==== Though this is almost certainly an undercount what seems clear is that Nigeria, like many other African countries, did not see the kinds of large numbers of hospitalizations and deaths seen in the US and Europe during the first wave of the pandemic.==== Using health center administrative data I can rule out increased provider workloads: I find no increase in monthly patient caseloads. I can also rule out a reduction in the number of available health workers in health facilities. If caseloads did not increase and staff strength did not decrease, this significantly undercuts the overburdened health worker hypothesis.====The immediate contribution of this paper is to show that the quality of routine health care interactions declined sharply during (and because of) the pandemic, at least in the early months. More broadly the paper informs our understanding of provider behavior, and specifically how providers might respond to risk. We know that healthcare providers are influenced by both intrinsic and extrinsic incentives (====, ====, ====, ====, ====); this paper highlights the role of job-related health risks. A salient dimension of this risk is the possibility of contracting an illness from a patient.==== During an infectious disease outbreak, as with the current Covid-19 pandemic, this risk not only rises but becomes increasingly salient. Health workers may respond to this risk in ways that may be socially costly. The key issue is that health workers do not fully internalize the costs of their responses. There is a connection here to the defensive medicine literature, which examines how exposure to litigation risk – and the fear of malpractice claims – leads healthcare providers to change how they practice (====, ====). ==== This paper highlights the potential role of health/mortality risk, as against liability risk, and the defensive behavior that may arise as a result.====This paper also connects to the literature on compensatory behavior in response to (information about) health-related risk. This has been shown in multiple contexts. ==== showed that teenage girls in Kenya, when provided with information on the relative risk of HIV by age and gender, reduced unsafe sex with older men. In another HIV-related example, ==== showed that individuals in Bangladesh, upon learning that their drinking was contaminated by arsenic, became more likely to switch to a different well, even though this was more costly. Closer to this context, ==== showed that work migrants in Nepal adjusted their migration decisions in response to information about mortality incidences of Nepali workers in their destination locations. Drawing the connection to this context, health workers appear to be adjusting their behavior in response to new information about the risk of caring for patients.

This study examines the effect of such rules on investments in children by analysing the introduction of Sharia law in northern Nigeria. Triple-differences estimates using temporal, geographical and religious variation together with large, representative survey data show decreases in infant mortality. Official government statistics further confirm improvements in survival. Findings also show that Sharia increased vaccination rates, duration of ","Sharia law, Islam’s legal system, is applied to varying degrees in around 40 countries. Economists acknowledge that religious rules or customs can influence individual or collective behaviour significantly (Iannaccone, 1998, Iyer, 2016). Empirical evidence further points to strong relationships between religion and outcomes related to children such as fertility (Iyer, 2002, Norris, Inglehart, 2004) or health (Bhalotra et al., 2010) in particular. Yet, there is little evidence on the causal impact of religious law on parental decisions.====This study estimates the effect of Islamic law on investments in children by exploiting a natural experiment. In 2000, the 12 northern states of Nigeria introduced Sharia law (Sharia states) for their Muslim citizens; the other 24 states maintained secular legislation (non-Sharia states). Sharia law contains very precise provisions codifying the safeguarding of children and also formalises children’s responsibility to maintain their parents in old age. These rules are enforced via strict penalties and can thus affect the costs and returns parents associate with their children. The first part of the paper uses large, representative survey data and finds that Sharia decreases infant mortality. The second part of the paper carries out an exploratory analysis investigating various mechanisms of impact such as child investments, law enforcement and supply side aspects. The research design exploits the unique temporal, geographical and religious variation caused by the sudden introduction of Sharia (for Muslims only). Moreover, I use the fact that application of Islamic law varies by exposure to Islamic police and discontinuously at state borders.====To estimate the reduced form effect of the Sharia introduction, I use a triple-differences framework that compares—over time—Muslims in Sharia states (the treated) to Muslims in non-Sharia states and then juxtaposes these differences with changes for Christians across the same regions. Difference-in-differences estimates from the 1999 and 2003 Nigerian Demographic Health Surveys (DHS) show that infant mortality decreases by around 5.6 percentage points (corresponding to 36% of the pre-treatment mean for the treated). The estimates are robust to the inclusion of mother fixed effects. The triple-differences specification rejects the hypothesis that the estimates are the same as for the Christian placebo sample, for which I find no effects.====After presenting the main mortality estimates, I address various identification concerns. Analysing the exact timing of child deaths, I document parallel trends for Muslims in Sharia and non-Sharia states before the Sharia introduction. Moreover, I address the concern of unobserved factors in Sharia states by comparing Muslims and Christians in those states only and find very similar effects. I also address the concern of reporting bias by re-estimating Sharia’s effect using official vital statistics I digitised from Nigerian National Population Commission reports on deaths and find reductions in mortality comparable to the DHS estimates. Finally, I explore the possible role of confounding factors such as civil unrest, violence and migration and also carry out a battery of robustness checks.====Since Sharia regulates many different aspects of Muslim life, the second part of the paper explores various mechanisms through which Islamic law might affect infant mortality. First, I consider investments in children. Sharia legally recognises children’s duty to maintain their parents in sickness or old age thus potentially increasing economic returns parents expect from their children. Consistent with an increase in the demand for child quality, I find that Sharia increased the probability of young children receiving vaccines by around 20 percentage points (corresponding to roughly 30% of the pre-treatment average) and increased the duration of breastfeeding by around 2 months (12% of the pre-treatment average). Peri-natal health behaviours such as take-up of antenatal care or birth assistance also improve. Compatible with an increase in demand for child quantity, the results show marked increases in both self-reported desires for more children and observed birth rates. Moreover, I find that the improvements in survival are more pronounced for boys (albeit not statistically significantly), who under Islamic custom are the main caretakers of parents in their old age.====As a second pathway of impact, I examine the importance of Islamic child protection legislation and its strict punishments for offenders. Evidence from law reports shows marked increases in the number of parents convicted of child neglect thus suggesting that, for some parents, the change in law was binding. Moreover, I estimate whether Sharia’s impact is stronger in states that introduced stricter child protection laws. Using the precise wording of legislations, I divide the 12 Sharia states into ==== (where punishments are stricter) and ==== states (where penalties are more moderate) and find considerably larger effects for the first set of states. Geospatial discontinuity estimates comparing individuals either side of state boundaries confirm these findings.====Connected to this, I examine the relative importance of Islamic law enforcement and of exposure to Islamic values. In an approach similar to Fafchamps and Moser (2003), I approximate exposure to Sharia law by the geographical distance between households and Islamic police stations. Before Sharia, infant mortality rates for children living in proximity to or at some distance from police stations show parallel trends. Once Sharia is introduced, however, decreases in mortality are significantly stronger for children living within walking distance of a police station suggesting law enforcement as a probable pathway of impact. By contrast, I find that Sharia’s impact does not vary by proximity to mosques, a likely proxy for exposure to Islamic values (Becker, Woessmann, 2009, Michalopoulos, Naghavi, Prarolo, 2018). Moreover, using attitudinal data collected before and after the Sharia introduction, I find no effect on two proxies for exposure to Islam: self-identification with Islam and seeking out of religious leaders. Together, these result suggest that the increased salience of Islamic values is an unlikely mechanism of impact.====Finally, I examine whether Sharia’s effect could be the result of other, secular mechanisms. I investigate whether the Sharia introduction led to a change in the profile of children, who were born, which, in turn, could affect their survival chances. However, I find no evidence of such selective responses. Moreover, I examine the role of state-specific policies. Using official data on state accounts, I cannot detect any change in policy expenditures by individual states. Neither do I find an effect of state-sponsored vaccination initiatives.====The results presented in this paper aim to further our understanding of how exposure to religious laws affects parental decisions. Research increasingly indicates that religion interrelates with socio-economic outcomes such as sanitation (Geruso and Spears, 2018), economic productivity (Andersen et al., 2017), happiness and economic growth (Campante and Yanagizawa-Drott, 2015), insurance (Dehejia et al., 2007), women’s rights (Meyersson, 2014), attitudes (Clingingsmith, Khwaja, Kremer, 2009, Guiso, Sapienza, Zingales, 2003), public goods (Berman and Laitin, 2008) and coping mechanisms (Binzel and Carvalho, forthcoming). This paper complements these studies by highlighting a scarcely documented determinant of child welfare for the world’s fastest growing religion (Pew Research Center, 2011). The paper also speaks to studies estimating the effect of ramadan fasting on early life outcomes and adult health (Almond, Mazumder, 2011, Jrges, 2015, Savitri, Painter, Lindeboom, Roseboom, Van Ewijk, 2019, van Ewijk, 2011). In fact, in an overview article Iyer (2016) highlights the links between religion and demography as being under-researched. Moreover, early childhood experiences have been documented to have long lasting impacts (see Gensowski, Nielsen, Nielsen, Rossin-Slater, Wst, 2019, Yi, Heckman, Zhang, Conti, 2015; for examples).====The analysis is also relevant to studies pertaining to the trade-off between child quantity and quality (Black, Devereux, Salvanes, 2005, Jensen, 2012, Qian, 2009). By linking Islamic laws to child outcomes, this analysis moreover relates to studies documenting the social (Bassi, Rasul, 2017, La Ferrara, Chong, Duryea, 2012), historical (Dell, 2010), economic (van den Berg et al., 2006) and policy (Bharadwaj, Fenske, Kala, Mirza, 2020, Buisman, Van de Poel, O’Donnell, van Doorslaer, 2018, Daysal, Trandafir, van Ewijk, 2019, Komro, Livingston, Markowitz, Wagenaar, 2016) influences on child survival, welfare and family related decisions.====The next section outlines the introduction of the Sharia and presents the data.

Policymakers in several states have responded to this phenomenon by implementing laws that restrict the use of handheld devices while operating a vehicle. In this paper, we utilize various quasi-experimental designs to estimate the impact of state-level handheld mandates on traffic fatalities. We find robust evidence that restricting the use of handheld devices while driving reduces daily traffic fatalities by 0.63 individuals in the short term. The results further indicate that while the magnitude of the impact is smaller in the long term, this policy is still effective at curbing traffic fatalities, saving more than 69 lives per state each year.","Distracted driving is one of the leading causes of traffic injuries and fatalities in the United States (National Center for Analysis and Statistics., 2021). Schroeder et al. (2018) found that 56% of individuals make phone calls, more than 28% utilize social media applications, and about 12% read text messages or emails while operating a vehicle. In addition, at any given moment during daylight hours, there are more than 620,000 passenger vehicles that are being driven by individuals who are simultaneously communicating on their handheld devices (Pickrell et al., 2015). Using a mobile device while driving increases the risk of an accident five-fold, and under certain conditions, distracted drivers are just as impaired as drunk drivers (Redelmeier, Tibshirani, 1997, Strayer, Drews, Crouch, 2006).====This phenomenon also levies a considerable cost on individuals, businesses, and the general public. In 2010 alone, distracted driving imposed a cost of $123 billion on society and accounted for about 15% of the total societal harm caused by motor vehicle crashes (Blincoe et al., 2015). Consequently, inattentive driving has become a serious public health concern and a key priority for policymakers. As of May 2020, legislators in more than 20 states have passed regulations that prohibit the use of handheld wireless communication devices, texting, dialing, or emailing while operating a vehicle (handheld bans).==== While many states have adopted handheld bans to discourage distracted driving and save lives, there are a limited number of well-identified studies on the effectiveness of this policy in reducing fatal motor vehicle accidents.====In this paper, we evaluate the impact of handheld bans on the number of traffic fatalities in the United States. This study has value because the number of states with handheld bans has tripled over the last decade and it is likely that the remaining states will adopt similar policies in the future. In addition, given the large cost that distracted driving imposes on society, a well-designed study may offer new insights on the role of this policy in improving traffic safety.====We leverage two quasi-experimental designs to estimate the causal impact of these laws. The first approach is the temporal regression discontinuity design (RD) which estimates the short-term impact of handheld bans within a 90-days bandwidth around the effective date of the policy in each state. This is a within-state design which uses time as the forcing variable and compares the trends in traffic fatalities in the period immediately before and after the policy is adopted. The main benefit of this approach is that we are able to difference out any unobserved covariates that do not vary within a local bandwidth around the effective date (e.g. other state-level laws) and examine the immediate impact of the policy when compliance is likely highest (McCartt et al., 2010).==== Our second estimation strategy, a difference-in-differences design (DID), exploits the variation in the timing of adoption of handheld bans across states. This approach estimates the average treatment effect on treated states over a longer time horizon by comparing states that adopt the policy to those that do not and comparing the states that adopt the policy earlier to those that adopt the policy later. We also employed the Goodman-Bacon decomposition to assess the robustness of our results to the comparison group utilized (Goodman-Bacon, 2018). Jointly, the two empirical approaches allow us to assess the immediate and longer-term impact of handheld bans and provide meaningful insight on the degree to which the treatment effect fades-out over time.====Since handheld laws increase the expected cost of distracted driving, conditional on the likelihood of being caught, economic theory predicts that the introduction of this mandate will likely reduce the level of distracted driving (Becker, 1968). McCartt et al. (2010) found that these mandates have a significant negative impact on handheld phone use while driving, lasting up to seven years after the ban is enacted. Furthermore, Braitman and McCartt (2010) found that the proportion of drivers who communicate on hands-free devices was nine percentage points higher in states with handheld bans compared to states without bans. This suggests that there is a high degree of compliance with these mandates over time.==== Consequently, handheld mandates may ultimately lead to a sustained reduction in the number of traffic fatalities.====However, empirical studies have yielded mixed results (McCartt et al., 2014). For example, some studies find that handheld bans are associated with a reduction in fatal accident rates or fatal crashes that involve teenage drivers (Abouk, Adams, 2013, Anyanwu, 2012, Lim, Chi, 2013, Nikolaev, Robbins, Jacobson, 2010, Sampaio, 2014). In contrast, other studies have found suggestive evidence that the introduction of handheld laws had no impact on collision claims, crash rates, or fatalities under normal weather and road conditions (Bhargava, Pathania, 2013, Kolko, 2009, Trempel, Kyrychenko, Moore, 2011). Through a systematic review, McCartt et al. (2014) argued that there are several methodological challenges that may have limited these studies from causally identifying the impact of this policy. This review highlighted that the results varied based on the covariates included, the control group, and the sample utilized.==== These limitations suggest that additional research is needed to better understand the impact of handheld bans in addressing this public health issue.====We found robust evidence that handheld bans reduce daily traffic fatalities by 0.63 individuals in the short term. In addition, using several specification and placebo checks, such as a local quadratic polynomial, donut RD design, count data models, various bandwidth sizes, and multiple placebo implementation dates lead to the same conclusion. We also found that our RD estimates cannot be plausibly explained by increased law enforcement activities because the policy did not lead police officers to stop or cite drivers more frequently. Using the DID design, we similarly found that handheld laws are effective at curbing traffic fatalities over a longer time horizon, although the results imply that the magnitude of the impact may fade-out over time. In particular, our long-term estimates are about one-tenth to one-third of the estimated short-term impact of the policy. These findings suggest that handheld bans may be an effective tool to combat the adverse consequences of distracted driving and that this policy may prevent at least 69 fatalities per treated state each year in the long term.====Our study makes three significant contributions to the literature: (i) this is the first study to examine the short-term impact of handheld bans using the temporal RD design. This is important because the literature suggests that compliance may be highest closer to the effective date of the policy. As such, our short-term estimates are likely an upper bound on the effectiveness of handheld bans. (ii) Unlike previous studies, we decompose our DID estimates to assess the importance of the control group utilized and the covariates included. (iii) Since we estimate both the short- and long-term impact of the policy, our study can assess the degree to which the effect of handheld bans may fade-out over time.",Do Cellphone Bans Save Lives?

Specifically, how much is alcohol consumption driven by the current environment versus individual characteristics? To answer this question, we analyze changes in alcohol purchases when consumers move from one state to another in the United States. We find that if a household moves to a state with a higher (lower) average alcohol purchases than the origin state, the household is likely to increase (decrease) its alcohol purchases right after the move. The current environment explains about two-thirds of the differences in alcohol purchases. The adjustment takes place both on the extensive and intensive margins.","Alcohol is one of the leading killers among substances. In 2016, alcohol was responsible for 5.3% of all deaths and 7.2% of all premature deaths (among persons 69 years of age and younger) worldwide (World Health Organization, 2018). Beyond direct health consequences, excessive alcohol consumption generates a social and economic burden on other people (Cawley, Ruhm, 2011, Cook, Moore, 2000).====Various factors affect alcohol consumption, such as taxes and other regulations, peers, and social norms. To identify each factor’s direct impact, studies have used changes in regulation (e.g. Carpenter, 2004, Marcus, Siedler, 2015) and random assignment of peers (e.g. Eisenberg et al., 2014). These studies give us a well-identified local average treatment effect in the short term. But over the long term, institutions and cultural norms are known to interact (Guiso et al., 2016), either magnifying or decreasing each factor’s direct effect.==== For example, peers who do not consume alcohol could vote for stricter alcohol regulation; strict alcohol regulation could lead to norms of consuming less alcohol and affect how children grow up viewing alcohol, which again changes the norm and leads to a different local environment. Quantifying the overall impact of the environment is important, as it tells us how malleable alcohol consumption is and informs us how much room there is for any alcohol policy. But measuring the combined effect is challenging because it typically requires looking at a long time horizon. However, over the long term, economic conditions change in other ways that also affect alcohol consumption. Therefore, less is known about the magnitude of the combined effect.====In this paper, we study how much the current environment drives alcohol purchases. To answer the question, we analyze changes in alcohol purchases when consumers move from one state to another in the United States. The magnitude of the change in movers’ alcohol purchases allows us to measure the relative importance of the current environment. Understanding how alcohol consumption responds to the current environment is crucial for designing effective policies.====Our empirical strategy relies on the fact that the environment, including supply conditions, alcohol regulation, taxes, and movers’ peers, changes discretely when consumers move. If the current environment mainly drives alcohol consumption, we would expect a jump in the mover’s alcohol purchases in the same direction as the gap between the destination and origin state. On the other hand, if alcohol consumption is only driven by individual characteristics, such as personal preferences and past experiences, we would not expect a change in the mover’s alcohol purchases.====We study the question using a panel of movers in the NielsenIQ scanner data of alcohol purchases. We observe their alcohol purchases years before and after the move. Our primary outcome variable is the logarithm of quarterly off-premise alcohol purchases measured in pure ethanol. We also measure alcohol purchases separately in beer, wine, and liquor categories and analyze the extensive margin—whether consumers buy any alcohol at all.====We estimate event study and difference-in-differences regressions with consumer and time period fixed effects. A possible concern with our identification strategy is that moves occur due to a shock that changes alcohol purchases. To alleviate the concern, we provide two pieces of evidence. First, we restrict the sample to movers whose observable characteristics, like household size, employment, and marital status, don’t change, and our results remain similar. Second, we compare trends in pre-move purchases of movers to higher versus lower alcohol-purchasing states. This shows that the movers who chose to go to different states before the move had similar trends in their purchases.====We find that if a household moves to a state with a higher (lower) average alcohol purchases than the origin state, the household is likely to increase (decrease) its alcohol purchases right after the move. About two-thirds of the gap in alcohol purchases between the origin and destination state closes immediately when a consumer moves. No sizable further change is seen after the immediate jump. This finding implies that the current environment explains a large share of the differences in alcohol purchases and that government policies and regulations targeting the drinking environment (e.g. alcohol availability) could have a significant impact on the amount of alcohol consumed.====There is some heterogeneity across product types. Consumers adjust their wine purchases more and their liquor purchases less. The adjustment takes place both on the extensive and intensive margins. On the extensive margin, movers are more (less) likely to buy alcohol when moving to a state with a larger (smaller) share of consumers buying alcohol. On the intensive margin, movers who bought alcohol before the move adjust the quantity in the direction of the average purchases in the destination state. There is evidence of asymmetries in adjustment, but mainly on the extensive margin. Consumers are more likely to adjust upward (start to purchase alcohol) than downward (stop buying alcohol). Our results are robust to a number of robustness checks using alternative samples, functional forms, controls, and geographic aggregation levels.====An important concern about the analysis is underreporting of alcohol purchases. In particular, whether the magnitude of underreporting changes at the move. This could happen if reporting depends on retail conditions, such as alcohol availability in grocery stores, which vary by state. We provide evidence that our results are not driven by the changes in reporting related to the retail conditions. When we restrict the sample to moves between states with similar retail conditions, movers still adjust their purchases. Another concern is that we only measure off-premise alcohol purchases, and we provide suggestive evidence that this is predictive of overall heavy drinking and chronic liver disease and cirrhosis mortality.====Our results based on movers and alcohol purchases might not generalize to the general population and other products. If movers are more likely to adjust to the new environment, our results provide an upper bound of how malleable alcohol purchases are in the general population. However, movers are also interesting in their own right because they are a large share of the population—more than 30% of the U.S. population has moved across the state lines in their lifetime (Molloy et al., 2011). Furthermore, our findings of the extent of the adjustment are specific to alcohol and don’t necessarily generalize to other products. For example, we show that movers adjust their cigarette purchases less than alcohol, and they don’t significantly adjust their food purchases. We also show that our estimation method replicates the results from the literature of a large adjustment for brands as in Bronnenberg et al. (2012) and no adjustment for healthy eating choices as in Allcott et al. (2019).====Our work contributes to the ongoing debate about how malleable alcohol consumption is and how much it is driven by the environment.==== We provide new causal evidence that the current environment explains about two-thirds of the variation in alcohol purchases. The current environment consists of many factors (including local regulation, norms, and peers), which in the long-term affect each other, making it difficult to measure the combined effect. Therefore, the literature mostly estimates the short-term direct effect of either taxes and regulations or peer effects. A notable exception is Yakovlev (2018), who uses a structural model and data on alcohol consumption and peers to estimate the impact of an increase in the price of vodka in Russia. He finds that peer effects play a large role in magnifying the impact of the price increase. We contribute to the literature by using an alternative method based on movers to overcome the difficulties in measuring the combined effect.====Our work also adds a new finding to the literature on how changes in the environment affect consumer behavior. In the case of food and drinks, the question was studied using movers in the same dataset, the NielsenIQ scanner data, by Bronnenberg et al. (2012), Allcott et al. (2019), Hut (2020).==== Bronnenberg et al. (2012) study the evolution of brand preferences and find that 60% of the gap between the destination and the origin average purchases of grocery products is bridged immediately after the move. Allcott et al. (2019) and Hut (2020) study how much the healthiness of food purchases changes with a move and find that the change is very small. Our results align with the evidence of large changes in brand choices while standing in contrast to little changes in the healthiness of food purchases. We hypothesize that large regional differences in alcohol regulation (availability and taxes) are the main reason for the large adjustment in alcohol purchases. So large regional differences in supply conditions are absent in food healthiness while existing for brands.====More generally, the literature on the convergence of behaviors of migrants has often found evidence of persistence, for example, for food preferences (Atkin, 2016), living arrangements (Giuliano, 2007), and fertility and female labor force participation (Fernández and Fogli, 2009). Our finding of sizable changes in alcohol purchases is not surprising, considering that alcohol consumption is a social activity. It is plausible that alcohol consumption is more influenced by social forces and the environment than other behaviors examined in the literature.====To quantify the importance of the environment in affecting population health, Finkelstein, Gentzkow, Williams, 2016, Finkelstein, Gentzkow, Williams, 2018, Finkelstein, Gentzkow, Williams, 2021 develop and employ the same empirical strategy of examining migrants’ behaviors. Our results on the role of the environment in alcohol purchases add an important dimension not previously examined in this literature. More generally, our paper relates to the recent work of Chetty et al. (2016) and Chetty and Hendren (2018b), which find that where one grows up is an important factor in affecting long-term outcomes such as intergenerational mobility and earning. Our paper provides an additional mechanism of why the environment matters. According to our findings, the current environment largely determines individuals’ alcohol purchases. Using a simple back-of-envelope calculation would suggest that if a household of two adults and one child moves from Utah to New Hampshire, the family’s alcohol purchases would increase by $27 per quarter. This shift in alcohol purchases could affect wealth, earnings, alcohol abuse, and the overall well-being.====Section 2 describes the data. Section 3 describes the empirical strategy.

If a patient has a donor who is immunologically compatible with her, a direct transplant can be performed within the pair.==== Otherwise, the patient has to register on a waiting list for a deceased donor or participate in a kidney exchange program, if available, whereby patients swap their donors to form compatible pairs (Roth et al., 2004). Unfortunately, these possibilities are quite limited, and the number of patients on waiting lists has been increasing.====Recently, immunosuppressive protocols have been developed to offer a new option of ====, or simply ====. This option is also referred to as “desensitization,” and it entails the administration of immunosuppressive medications and plasmapheresis treatment. When a patient chooses this option, preoperative management starts three to four weeks before transplantation. The patient takes intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and rituximab (anti-CD20) to remove antibodies and block antibody synthesis. The patient also undergoes plasmapheresis, while other medications, such as calcineurin inhibitors, mycophenolate mofetil, and steroids, are added to this procedure for maintaining immunosuppression. After transplantation, the patient waits for her immune system to regenerate while preventing it from attacking the new organ. For better outcomes, various desensitization techniques have been developed and used for blood/tissue-type incompatible transplants by combining high-/low-dose IVIG, plasmapheresis/immunoadsorption, and other suppressive medications, such as bortezomib and imlifidase (IdeS).==== By adopting this procedure, the patient can receive a transplant from any donor, either compatible or incompatible. We simply say that the patient ==== when she receives an incompatible transplant via this option.====Although it is ideal for a patient to receive a compatible transplant with minor suppressive treatment, incompatible transplants can be a good alternative when compatible transplants are unavailable, as the effectiveness of desensitization has been confirmed by a number of clinical and laboratory investigations. For instance, the long-term survival rate after ABO blood-type incompatible transplantation is approximately equivalent to that of ABO-compatible (ABOc) transplants: according to the 2018 Annual Report of the ==== (KONOS), the five-year survival rate of ABO-incompatible (ABOi) living donor kidney transplants is 95.3%, while that of ABOc living-donor kidney transplants is 96.3%. The performances of tissue-type incompatible transplants and those with a positive crossmatch (PCM) have also been reported to be satisfactory and superior to receiving maintenance dialysis while waiting for transplants from deceased donors.====Consequently, the number of patients using suppressants is rapidly increasing. As shown in Table 1, the proportion of blood-type incompatible kidney transplants in Korea increased from 4.7% to 26.3% of the total living donor transplants from 2009–2018.==== Along with this rapid increase, it is also noticeable in Table 1 that kidney exchange has disappeared in Korea and all transplants from living donors are performed directly within patient–donor pairs. As no exchange exists, ==== patient with an incompatible donor has to use a suppressant to receive a transplant under the current practice in Korea. Heo et al. (2021) report that this is not the best approach to use suppressants and propose using suppressants in combination with kidney exchanges. The following example illustrates this proposal:====Since all patients can now receive direct transplants from their own donors by using suppressants at worst, we aim to maximize ==== transplants, or equivalently, to minimize the use of suppressants, by organizing exchange cycles and ==== carefully, as shown in the example above. Note that the number of suppressants needed for a pool coincides with the number of selected chains because for each chain, only one patient at the head needs to use a suppressant.====A key feature of this proposal is that the patient–donor pairs, who ==== compatible through the use of suppressants, still participate in kidney exchanges. By joining the exchange system, an incompatible pair has a chance to find a compatible donor, either in a cycle or in a chain. Even if the pair is chosen to use a suppressant at the head of a chain, the patient would still participate in the exchange, provided that it does not make a significant difference from which donor a patient receives a kidney, because it helps other pairs receive compatible transplants along the chain. Such “altruistic” motivation of participation is well noted in the standard kidney exchange problem, where ==== pairs plays the same role as the pairs at the head in our setup (Gentry, Segev, Simmerling, Montgomery, 2007, Roth, Sönmez, Ünver, 2005, Sönmez, Ünver, 2014). To promote participation of these pairs, additionally, an incentive option can be offered in the transplant system, such as guaranteeing a higher priority in retransplantation in case of future renal failure (Eames, Holder, Zambrano, 2017, Sönmez, Ünver, Yenmez, 2020).====A natural question arises here: How much welfare gain can we achieve by implementing this proposal and how do we measure it? As it is relatively new to use suppressants for incompatible transplants, as yet, there are not much data publicly available in most countries. Moreover, national health care systems and insurance coverage of desensitization vary significantly across countries. Because it is difficult to measure the welfare gain in terms of medical cost, we rather propose to measure it based on a total reduction of suppressants. We introduce a computational algorithm, which we call “the minimum chains algorithm.” This algorithm selects a set of exchange cycles and chains that minimizes the number of suppressants needed for transplants of a pool of patient–donor pairs. We then derive closed-form minimum values from the algorithm and run simulations over a number of sample patient–donor pools that we generate by using biological characteristics in Korea and the U.S.====From these simulation results, we find that suppressants can be reduced by 60% to 70% from what is needed under the current practice in Korea, depending on the pool size. We also compare the outcomes of the minimum chains algorithms under different feasibility constraints on exchange size. In principle, there should be no limit in the size of exchanges to achieve full efficiency, but it is quite difficult to arrange 3-way exchanges or more in practice due to the physical/capacity constraints and uncertainties involved in performing simultaneous operations.==== However, our simulation result shows that arranging 2-way exchanges is enough to exhaust the benefit of this program. We also find the ==== in exchanges, in the sense that the ratio of incompatible transplants to the total transplants decreases with the pool size. Interestingly, this change slows down and remains almost invariant when the pool size reaches 100.====For each patient–donor pair X-Y, in addition, we can apply the algorithm to the pools ==== and ==== the pair. The difference between the resulting outcomes indicates the ==== (or ====) of the pair in the suppressant reduction process. More precisely, we assess the value of each “highly demanded” pair (or ==== pair) in the pool, such as AB-O, AB-A, and B-O pairs, and show that their values are determined by the ABO blood-type frequencies of other pairs in the pool. We similarly measure the cost of each “oversupplied” pair (or ==== pair), such as O-AB, O-A, and B-AB pairs.====Table 1 also shows that the transplantation practice in Korea is significantly different from that in the U.S.: the United Network for Organ Sharing in the U.S. is running national kidney exchange programs successfully, realizing a substantial improvement in kidney transplantation. However, desensitization has not been utilized there as much as in Korea. Such a difference in the transplantation system motivates us to inquire about how medical systems would evolve in these countries, as suppressants become available for exchanges. One important factor that influences the pathway would be the actual gain from adopting the new transplant system. Using the minimum chains algorithm, we measure and compare the welfare gains in the two countries. We find that the gain in Korea exceeds that in the U.S. and the difference originates from the ABO blood-type distributions.====The literature on kidney exchange stems from the seminal work conducted by Roth et al. (2004) and most papers on the subject have taken the compatibility profiles as a primitive of the problem. More recently, however, newly developed technologies for transplant have been used to modify the compatibility profiles of a pool. Andersson and Kratz (2020) consider suppressants used for blood-type incompatible transplants and introduce a priority-based algorithm in the 2-way exchange framework. As for suppressants used for blood-/tissue-type incompatible transplants, Heo, Hong, Chun, 2021, Heo, Hong, Chun, 2022 provide an axiomatic foundation of constructing a centralized transplant system. A “blood-subtyping” technology in Sönmez et al. (2018) also enables transplants between certain ABOi blood-types. However, it is shown that this technology may have a negative externality on kidney exchanges.====Regarding kidney transplant logistics, Roth et al. (2004) initially impose no restriction on exchange size, but the 2-way exchanges have taken a central position in the market design literature (Bogomolnaia, Moulin, 2004, Roth, Sönmez, Ünver, 2004, Roth, Sönmez, Ünver, 2005). Since then, there have been multiple proposals to enhance efficiency and fairness of kidney exchange system (Ausubel, Morrill, 2014, Kim, Li, 2022, Sönmez, Ünver, 2014, Sönmez, Ünver, Yenmez, 2020). Various transplant systems, including exchange programs, have been broadly studied in the empirical and experimental literature as well. Ghanbariamin and Chung (2020), for instance, identify the causal effect of participation to the U.S. national kidney exchange system on patients’ welfare, such as the probability of receiving a transplant and quality of matches. Li et al. (2013), on the other hand, focus on kidney allocation rules for waiting lists and perform experiments to compare the gains from adopting the status quo, the ==== rule, and the ==== rule. Although we also consider a set of different matching mechanisms with various arrangements, we utilize a computational algorithm, with which we run simulations.====In structuring the problem and executing simulations, we owe much to Roth et al. (2007), who measure the welfare impact of kidney exchange programs in the standard setup ==== suppressants. They calculate the number of compatible transplants enabled through exchanges under various feasibility constraints. We extend their analysis to a new environment where patients have an access to the option of desensitization. In this new setup, we calculate the maximum number of compatible transplants enabled through exchanges and desensitization protocols (equivalently, reduction of incompatible transplants) by arranging chains for exchange. We show that some findings of Roth et al. (2007) still carry over, such as the economies of scale and the benefit of relaxing feasibility constraints. However, we derive additional findings that are new to the literature. Those findings include 2-way exchanges being the optimal arrangement and the minimum pool size to exhaust the benefit of exchange. Also, we introduce a way of calculating the added value/cost of each type of patient-donor pair and discuss its policy implication. More details will follow in Section 4.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we formulate a model of kidney exchange with suppressants. In Section 3, we introduce 2- and 3-way minimum chains algorithms and prove that these algorithms calculate the minimal suppressants needed for transplants of each pool. In Section 4, we apply these algorithms to the pools that we construct for Korea and the U.S. and present the simulation results. We also discuss robustness of these results by dropping the two underlying assumptions one by one.

Women also exhibit great heterogeneity in the association, but our measures of the childhood environment do not explain it.","Educational attainment is a strong predictor of longevity. Prior studies across different disciplines and in various countries show that those with more years of schooling have a lower mortality risk compared to those with less education (Baker et al., 2011; Buckles et al., 2016; Hummer and Hernandez, 2013; Kitagawa and Hauser, 1973; Lleras-Muney, 2005). In the US, these educational disparities in mortality have increased dramatically since the mid-1980s (Case and Deaton, 2015, 2017, 2021; Hayward et al., 2015; Meara et al., 2008; Montez et al., 2011; Olshansky et al., 2012; Sasson, 2016). Understanding the nature of this relationship and the reasons why it is so strong and persistent is a key issue for both researchers and policymakers.====In this paper, we investigate the relationship between education and longevity, which we refer to as the education gradient, using a novel and very large individual-level dataset for the US. We combine individual data from the 1940 full census with death records and information from family trees in FamilySearch to create a sample of more than 17 million white individuals born in the US between 1876 and 1915. FamilySearch has a wiki-style platform for recording genealogical information that includes profiles for 1.2 billion people. These profiles are linked together through family relationships which allows us to compare siblings or twins. We then focus on understanding whether education gradients vary as a function of the childhood environment and why. We do so by estimating education gradients by place of birth (and cohort if possible) and relating them to place characteristics for the 1906-1915 cohort.====We find large associations between education and longevity: conditional on surviving to age 35, one more year of schooling is associated with 0.4 additional years of life for both men and women born 1906-1915. The results are identical when we include sibling or twin fixed effects, alleviating concerns that our estimates are biased as a result of any omitted variables that are fixed within a family. While family fixed effects do not solve the issue of causality, these results suggest that if there are important omitted variables, they are individual ones, not contextual (state or local level) or family-level determinants of health (such as shared genes).==== Of course, this does not imply that family level covariates do not matter for education or longevity—it simply suggests that the family component that is correlated with longevity is not the same as the family component that is correlated with education (Black et al., 2022).====We then document for the first time that there is substantial variation in the association between education and longevity based on place of birth (either state or city of birth). Children in the US grow up in vastly different environments. These environments have substantial effects on the education, earnings, health, and demographic outcomes of individuals (Almond et al., 2018; Chetty et al., 2014a; Chetty et al., 2014b; Dudovitz et al., 2018; Dudovitz et al., 2016). Previous research has shown that, in addition to affecting lifetime outcomes, these early environments also moderate the returns to education in the labor market.==== We document that these conditions also moderate the returns to education on health. For men, the education gradient in longevity is ==== if they were born in places with greater education, greater longevity, greater incomes, and better health resources. It is also larger for men who went to school in places where the quality of school was higher. Thus, for men the effect of education is larger in places where other resources that complement the production of human capital are larger during childhood. But there are no such relationships for women in our data—education is also a strong predictor of longevity for women, but we found no place-of-birth covariates that robustly predict the size of the gradient among women. We discuss these differences by sex and other implications of our findings.====There is a very large literature investigating the relationship between education and mortality that started with the seminal study of Kitagawa and Hauser (1973), who first documented in the US that mortality rates are lower for more educated groups. Since then, various studies have investigated many aspects of this relationship, including the functional form of the relationship, how it varies with age, and what mechanisms may explain it. Economic interest in this relationship began with the theoretical and empirical work of Grossman (1972), who first theorized reasons why the more educated might experience higher levels of health. In the last 20 years, economists have mostly focused on determining whether this relationship is causal by exploiting natural experiments, investigating either changes in compulsory schooling, or using twin designs. A series of recent reviews and meta-analysis in both economics (Galama et al., 2018; Grossman, 2015) and demography (Byhoff et al., 2017; Hamad et al., 2018; Xue et al., 2021) summarize the results of this body of work and conclude that it appears that education does not cause greater health and reduced mortality in all contexts and for all groups, but it is unclear why this heterogeneity exists.====This paper makes two contributions to this literature. First, we make use of the fact that our dataset is very large to provide systematic empirical evidence that the childhood environment modifies the education-longevity relationship. There are only a few studies that attempt to systematically understand the reason why education gradients vary across studies. Using a meta-analysis that collects estimates from many studies, Xue et al. (2021) conclude that methodological differences account for all the variation across studies and that education does not have a causal effect on mortality. But other studies (Barcellos et al., 2018, 2019; Gathmann et al., 2015; Kamhöfer et al., 2019) that estimate the causal effects of education, explicitly allowing for heterogeneity ==== the same study, find evidence that returns are indeed heterogeneous. These returns vary as a function of individual genetic endowments and baseline health (Barcellos et al., 2018) and are larger for those that had greater readiness or potential gains (Kamhöfer et al., 2019).====We investigate how environmental factors, rather than individual factors, modify the gradient. Montez et al. (2019a,b) document that education gradients vary by state of residence, but it is unclear why. Environmental conditions are of interest because they can be manipulated through public policy, which is often determined at the state and local level. We hypothesize that environmental conditions during childhood (measured by conditions in the place of birth) affect the health returns to years of schooling. As Galama et al. (2018) argue, education gradients in health are likely larger in places with more complementary education inputs because it is ultimately skill rather than time spent in school that likely matters for health. The intuition for this result is simple: time spent in school translates into greater skills when other resources, like good teachers, are available. Skills are also better developed when other conditions are also met. Children who are in good health are also more likely to absorb material, as are children who have access to other complementary inputs such as books and uniforms (Baumann and Krskova, 2016; Glewwe and Miguel, 2007). Our findings support this hypothesis for men.====In this area, our study is closest to Frisvold and Golberstein (2011) and Aaronson et al. (2021) who investigate the health returns to school quality among Black men. We extend their work by studying white men and women, controlling for family fixed effects and investigating other possible reasons why education gradients vary by state of birth.==== We demonstrate that the findings for Black men extend to white men but not to white women, that they are robust to controlling for family fixed effects, and also show that school quality is not the only moderator of the education health gradient among men. Our work is also related to the literature that investigates how geography affects health outcomes (Deryugina and Molitor, 2020; Finkelstein et al., 2021), but we focus on how environments affect returns to human capital, not their direct impact on health. Our study is similar to Chetty et al. (2016) who document that in the US today there are large income gradients in adult mortality that vary widely across depending on where individuals live.====Our second contribution is to document that genealogical data can be leveraged to successfully advance research on the education-health relationship. In this area, our work is most closely related to that work by Halpern-Manners et al. (2020), who also use US census data matched to death certificates to estimate the effects of education on longevity and investigate the robustness of their findings to the inclusion of family fixed effects among siblings or twins. In the US, most studies on the education-mortality gradient rely on survey data or vital statistics where family identifiers are not available. Like Halpern-Manners et al. (2020), we find that our results are very similar whether or not we include sibling or twin fixed effects. This is similar to the results in Lundborg et al. (2016) for Sweden and stands in contrast to results of other studies with smaller sample sizes.====Our work complements that of Halpern-Manners et al. (2020) in several ways. We show that the Family Tree data can confirm many of the stylized facts in the literature using period mortality, establishing that our data is of high quality. First, life expectancy derived from our data closely resembles the life expectancy in social security life tables. Second, we reproduce education gradients estimated in previous published papers, specifically in the seminal Kitagawa and Hauser (1973) study and the influential follow-up paper by Elo and Preston (1996). Third, we show that the education-longevity gradient exhibits well-known patterns estimated for mortality: it exhibits credentialing effects for men, it diminishes with age (Crimmins, 2005; Elo and Preston, 1996; Kaestner et al., 2020; Kitagawa and Hauser, 1973; Lynch, 2003), and it has become larger for more recently born cohorts (Kaestner et al., 2020; Meara et al., 2008; Montez et al., 2011; Montez et al., 2019b; Olshansky et al., 2012).====Our data does not suffer from truncation because death information is collected from many sources. We document that the education-longevity gradient is grossly underestimated when the data on deaths are truncated. Halpern-Manners et al. only observe deaths for men between 1973 and 2013. If we restrict our deaths to 1973-2013 the estimated coefficient on education for men falls from 0.38 to 0.28. Other studies use the public Social Security Numident files which only include deaths occurring between 1988 and 2005.==== In our sample, the coefficient on education falls from 0.40 to only 0.33 if we exclude deaths in old age (after 2005, roughly age after age 95) and to only 0.10 when we exclude deaths in prime age years (between 1940 and 1988, roughly between ages 30 and 78). Thus, education plays a particularly important role on preventing early deaths, and truncated death records miss this important impact.====Finally, and perhaps most importantly, our data include women, which is another major strength of the Family Tree data, and is large enough to investigate spatial heterogeneity.==== Halpern-Manners et al. (2020) cannot track women using their matching methods because women often change their names when they marry. We show that the education gradient of men and women follow different patterns, particularly when we break these based on place of birth. Halpern-Manners et al. (2020) document that the education longevity gradient is larger for individuals who come from more advantageous backgrounds measured by parental occupation-based income. Our results for men are consistent with these findings, although we focus on broader childhood environments. Our results for women are different as we discuss extensively.",The association between educational attainment and longevity using individual-level data from the 1940 census,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629622000686,27 June 2022,2022,Research Article,56.0

On the one hand, the decrease in the proportion of adults of working age has resulted in government incentives aimed at delaying retirement. On the other hand, the growth of the retirement-age population has increased pressures on publicly provided pensions, income assistance, and health care. This has resulted in a shift toward policies favouring the supply of care within the community, away from institutions (Colombo et al., 2011). The working-age population is therefore asked both to work longer and to contribute an increasing amount of unpaid time to the care of aging family members and friends. Despite a large body of work on the topic, substantial uncertainty remains regarding the impact of caregiving on employment (e.g., van Houtven et al., 2013). Nevertheless, mounting evidence shows that the intensity of caregiving mediates this effect, and that different dimensions of caregiving intensity impact various groups differently.====In this paper, I investigate the interaction of two measures of informal caregiving intensity and their impact on caregivers' employment and retirement status. The formal care sector is largely structured around the provision of services for individuals who differ in terms of the duration and depth of their needs. However, the literature on the impact of informal caregiving has relied largely on measures of caregiving intensity based on average hours of care, while neglecting to account for the duration of caregiving arrangements.==== This limits our ability to understand how different policies may impact caregivers. To address this, I construct a new measure of caregiving intensity based on the number of months of care provided, and I investigate differences in the impact of months- and hours-based caregiving intensity on employment. My analysis exploits the Longitudinal and International Study of Adults (LISA), a Canadian panel survey which provides data on the monthly caregiving status of respondents over a six-year period. I focus on care provided to parents.==== This allows me to develop a simple model of labor supply, which accounts for the specificities of this particular caregiving relationship, and which I use to provide interpretation for my results.====Estimating the interaction of months and hours of care as determinants of labor market outcomes requires accounting for the endogeneity of caregiving. Specifically, existing research shows that time-invariant unobserved determinants of employment are correlated with caregiving (Casado-Marín et al., 2011; Ciani, 2012; Heitmueller, 2007; Leigh, 2010; Meng, 2013; van Houtven et al., 2013). One alternative is to try and instrument separately for each form of caregiving. However, identifying the effects of interest relies heavily on finding a determinant of hours-based caregiving intensity that doesn't impact months-based caregiving intensity directly, and vice versa (Wooldridge, 2010). Instead, I exploit the panel structure of the data and estimate a fixed effects model of employment, using both measures of caregiving intensity as regressors. This strategy is informed by the large volume of research which has shown, consistently and in a variety of contexts, that the exogeneity of caregiving cannot be rejected after controlling for individual fixed effects (Casado-Marín et al., 2011; Ciani, 2012; Jacobs et al., 2017; Meng, 2013; van Houtven et al., 2013).====My contribution is three-fold. First, I document months-based caregiving intensity for the first time, and contrast it with the usual hours-based measure. The comparison serves the dual purpose of informing months of care provided by caregivers, and of shedding a new light on previous findings that rely on hours of care as the measure of intensity.====The differences I observe between months- and hours-based measures of intensity suggest that the two capture distinct aspects of informal care provision. This is important given that intensity is a key factor determining the differential impact of caregiving on various groups. In particular, previous work suggests that female employment is more sensitive to hours-based caregiving intensity than male employment (Fu et al., 2017; Leigh, 2010; van Houtven et al., 2013). My second contribution is to this literature. Individuals who provide 10 or more hours of care in a typical week are often considered to be high-intensity caregivers. In this paper, I refer to them as primary caregivers, to denote the fact that they bear a relatively high degree of responsibility.==== In line with existing research, I find that only women respond to primary caregiving. Moreover, I provide novel evidence showing that the magnitude of their response depends on the number of months for which they provide care. Specifically, I define short-term and long-term caregivers as those who provide 1–6 and 7–24 months of care, respectively. Among women in mid-career, both short- and long-term primary caregiving decrease employment. Primary caregiving also affects the employment of women in late career, but failing to account for the duration of care conceals that effect. This heterogeneity can help explain results according to which primary caregiving has a lesser or even no impact on older women (Crespo and Mira, 2014; van Houtven et al., 2013).====While there is still mixed evidence about the impact of hours-based caregiving intensity on men, their employment has been found to respond to alternative measures of caregiving intensity (Leigh, 2010; van Houtven et al., 2013). I add to this literature, by showing that men adjust their employment when they engage in secondary caregiving (less than 10 h per week), but that the effect depends on the duration of caregiving. Hence, for both women and men, the literature reports null or moderate effects which I find conceal heterogeneity based on months of care provided. Moreover, the model I present in the paper shows that differences in the impact of primary and secondary caregiving, based on the duration of care, are consistent with differences in months of care reflecting disparities in future parental needs. As such, incorporating both measures of intensity is helpful to understand the underlying mechanisms through which caregiving affects employment.====The interaction of months and hours of care in their effect on employment also carries over to retirement status and plans to retire. In particular, I find that caregiving impacts women's plans to retire in the same direction as their employment. This is consistent with women intertemporally substituting work to meet the needs of their aging parents. The same pattern is not observed among men.====Finally, my findings help inform the place of different types of informal caregivers in the broader continuum of care, and how various programs and policies may impact them differently. Notably, I show that the impact of short-term caregiving can be greater than the impact of long-term caregiving. This stems from the fact that mid-career men and late-career women and men scale back their response to caregiving when care is provided over longer periods of time. Hence, I demonstrate that months and hours of care interact as determinants of employment, and that they do so non-linearly; that is, the effect of providing a certain number of hours of care on a weekly basis changes not only in magnitude, but also in direction when that care is provided for a longer period of time. As countries around the world are transforming how they care for seniors to face demographic changes, these are important considerations; especially because months and hours of care impact female and male caregivers differently, and in ways that change with age.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. I present an overview of the relevant literature and of the institutional background in Sections 2 and 3. In Section 4, I introduce the theoretical framework. I discuss the data in Section 5 and present some descriptive results in Section 6. I present the empirical strategy and main results of the paper in Sections 7 and 8. Finally, I conclude in Section 9.",Heterogeneity in informal care intensity and its impact on employment,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629622000662,18 June 2022,2022,Research Article,57.0

Finally, CEP exposure is associated with an almost 5 percent decline in households classified as food insecure. Our results on the heterogeneous effects of CEP exposure by prior free/reduced price lunch eligibility reveal benefits in terms of both spending, dietary composition, and food insecurity for previously eligible low-income families, suggesting that the stigma of free school meals may be declining after universal access.","The national school lunch program (NSLP) is the second largest nutrition assistance program in the US, costing about $13.8 billion annually. Nearly 100,000 schools serve lunches to about 30 million students each day, with 22 million students served at free or reduced-prices (USDA, 2019). The NSLP is a critical part of the social safety net and provides substantial resources to low-income families, for whom school lunches represent an important source of calories and nutrition. While other important safety net programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), have been shown to have important impacts on household budgets (Carr, Packham, 2019, Hamrick, Andrews, 2016, Kuhn, 2018, Laurito, Schwartz, 2019, Shapiro, 2005), we know much less about the impact of access to free school lunches on household spending and diet composition.====Measuring the impact of access to free school lunches on household budgets is challenging because eligibility has traditionally been based on family income, and households decide when to participate, making it likely that NSLP take-up is correlated with other important determinants of household spending, such as income, family size, and martial status. We overcome this identification challenge by exploiting variation from the introduction of universal free school meals through the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP).====Despite the nutritional importance of school meals for low-income students, an estimated 20-55 percent of students eligible for free lunch do not participate.==== Prior to the introduction of the CEP, stigma and application costs represented significant barriers to participation in the NSLP. Bhatia et al. (2011), for example, found that the availability of unsubsidized foods competing with the NSLP made NSLP participation itself an easily visible marker of income status, stigmatizing students and discouraging participation. To reduce these barriers to school meal participation, the Community Eligibility Provision eliminates applications for free and reduced-price school meals and allows schools with students that meet a certain poverty threshold==== to provide free meals for all students, regardless of their family income. As of 2019, the take-up rate for eligible schools was about 65 percent, making CEP available to over 13.6 million students in more than 28,000 schools and over 4,600 districts across the US (Maurice et al., 2019).====By reducing the price of school meals to zero for families with children in eligible schools, CEP is likely to have a significant impact on household budgets and food spending for both newly eligible households and households previously eligible but who did not participate. Through its impact on the household budget, CEP may also alter the composition of household food purchases and affect the dietary quality of at-home food consumption. Not only could this have important implications for household nutrition and obesity in the short-run, but research has also shown policy-driven increases in access to food during childhood can improve later life health and economic outcomes (Bütikofer, Mølland, Salvanes, 2018, Hoynes, Schanzenbach, Almond, 2016). Thus, the impact of CEP on household budgets and dietary quality have important implications for long run outcomes and improved intergenerational mobility.====This paper studies the impact of providing universal free school meals through the Community Eligibility Provision on household food spending, diet composition, and food security. Our identification strategy exploits plausibly exogenous variation in the availability of CEP over time, which is independent of individual household take-up decisions. Using the Nielsen household panel data from 2004-2016 and the Current Population Survey from 2001-2017, we estimate the effect of CEP exposure on grocery store purchases, dietary quality, and food security for households with school-aged children compared to those without school-aged children.====We find that CEP exposure reduces spending on food by about $11 per month, or about 5 percent from the mean, among households with children relative to households without children. We also focus on a set of food groups we categorize as typical lunch or breakfast foods and find a $5.50, or about 9 percent decrease in monthly spending on these foods. Next, we explore the effect of CEP on the dietary quality of household grocery purchases with a composite health score of grocery store purchases. For lower-income households with children, we reject the hypothesis that dietary quality of purchases worsens after CEP and find suggestive evidence of an improvement in overall dietary quality by about 3 percent. This suggests that lower-income households may substitute toward more healthy food consumed at home while also saving money. In addition to these differing effects across household income levels, we also examine heterogeneity by school levels and find the largest reductions in grocery spending among households in areas with large takeup of CEP at the primary school level. Finally, we find that CEP leads to large improvements in household food security. These results support the hypothesis that previously-eligible low-income households experience significant benefits from the adoption of CEP.====Previous literature has documented the benefits of free school meals along other important dimensions. For example, research has documented the impact of the NSLP and SBP on improving student health (Gundersen et al., 2012), student nutritional intake (Campbell, Nayga Jr, Park, Silva, 2011, Gleason, Suitor, 2003), and student cognitive achievement (Frisvold, 2015). Some work showed important differences in the effect of the NSLP and SBP. For example, Millimet et al. (2010) documented that the SBP program reduced childhood obesity, whereas the NSLP program exacerbated childhood obesity. Using the 1980-81 National Evaluation of School Nutrition Programs data, Long (1991) showed that additional spending on NSLP benefits decreased household food expenditures by about half the amount spent on the NSLP, but that an additional dollar of SBP benefits had no significant impact on household food expenditures. Research has also documented important benefits associated with the recent expansion of NSLP and SBP to all students at participating schools through CEP. Access to free school meals through CEP improves test scores and academic outcomes (Gordanier, Ozturk, Williams, Zhan, 2020, Ruffini, 2021, Schwartz, Rothbart, 2017) and reduces school suspensions (Gordon and Ruffini, 2018).==== We build upon this literature by providing novel estimates of the impact of access to and take-up of free school meals through CEP on household food spending and household diet composition.====In the context of low-income families who are eligible for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), a body of research indicates that these households are especially likely to face resource constraints towards the end of the SNAP benefit cycle when the benefits are running out. For instance, studies have shown that food consumption declines and grocery store theft increases toward the end of the benefit cycle (Carr, Packham, 2019, Hamrick, Andrews, 2016, Shapiro, 2005). Kuhn (2018) also shows evidence that diet quality worsens over the benefit month, but that children may be protected from some cyclical food insecurity by school meal programs. Similarly, Laurito and Schwartz (2019) find that school lunch participation rates are linked to the timing of SNAP payments and conclude that school lunches may fill the “SNAP gap”. However, less is known about the causal impact in the reverse direction, so we seek to discover how access to free school meals impacts household budget constraints. The roll out of CEP across schools allows us to examine not only the effect of free school meals on previously eligible households, but also the effect on households that did not already qualify for free meals and do not face such tight resource constraints.====This paper expands upon existing work and makes several important contributions to the literature. First, we show the impact of an increase in access to free school meals on household food purchases. CEP is a costly program aimed to eliminate food insecurity and improve nutrition and academic outcomes for the nation’s poorest students, but the impact of CEP extends beyond education and schools and also affects households directly by relaxing budget constraints. Resulting changes in household grocery purchases can have a direct impact on students, as well as spillover effects on other family members. Understanding the impact of CEP on household budgets can provide insight as to the amount households save and the way in which they might reallocate their purchases between different types of food or redistribute their budget across household members.====This paper also provides new evidence documenting the impact of access to free school meals on the healthiness of household food purchases. Existing work has shown that the nutritional content of school lunches can impact child health (Bhattacharya, Currie, Haider, 2006, Schanzenbach, 2009) and improving the dietary quality of school meals can impact test scores (Anderson, Gallagher, Ritchie, 2018, Belot, James, 2011, Figlio, Winicki, 2005). However, no paper has considered that free school meals may change the health quality of at-home food purchases as well. The dietary quality of food consumed at both home and school matters, but it is unclear how access to free school lunch changes the dietary quality of household grocery purchases and food consumed outside of school. Researchers have estimated that eating a healthy diet costs about $1.50 more per day (Rao et al., 2013), so relaxing the household budget constraint could allow households to afford healthier food such as fruits and vegetables. On the other hand, if households substitute toward less healthy food consumed at home, this may diminish the benefits of CEP. Again, these changes in household diet quality may also have spillover effects to other family members which have been previously unexplored.====Third, with information on household income, this paper explores whether CEP benefited households that were previously eligible for free lunch. We find that these low income households experience grocery savings, are able to purchase a healthier bundle of food, and experience declines in food insecurity. In this way, we document the degree to which the non-monetary stigma and application costs prevented these households from participating in free school meals prior to universal availability. Our results suggest that if there are low participation rates in the targeted group for a specific policy with the presence of stigma and application costs, expanding access and reducing application costs can increase participation among the targeted group.====Finally, this paper contributes to a literature documenting the impact of eligibility for free school meals on food insecurity among low income households (Arteaga, Heflin, 2014, Fletcher, Frisvold, 2017). Our work expands upon this literature to show that universal free school meals through CEP also have an important impact on reducing food insecurity. Our findings complement recent work by Ozturk et al. (2021) documenting a decrease in food bank use with higher CEP exposure.====Not only do our findings have important implications for household spending, nutrition, and food security in the short run, but improvements to early childhood nutrition and food security driven by CEP can have important impacts on later life health, earnings, and education (Bütikofer, Mølland, Salvanes, 2018, Hoynes, Schanzenbach, Almond, 2016). As the effect on earnings can be transmitted across generations (Bütikofer et al., 2018), our findings may translate into increased intergenerational mobility and reductions in existing disparities.",The Effect of Free School Meals on Household Food Purchases: Evidence from the Community Eligibility Provision,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629622000650,17 June 2022,2022,Research Article,58.0

Individuals differ in their severity of illness and there is ====moral hazard. We consider two regimes: one in which insurers use coinsurance rates (==== reimbursements) and one in which insurers use co-payments (specific reimbursements). We show that the induced equilibrium with co-payments involves a lower producer price and a higher level of welfare for consumers even though it may imply a larger consumer price. This result provides strong support for a reference price based reimbursement policy.","Following Feldstein, 1970, Feldstein, 1973 and later on Feldman and Dowd (1991), there is a common view among economists that insurance coverage is too large when ==== the market for health insurance is perfectly competitive and ==== there is imperfect competition among health care providers.====The reason underlying this result is that competitive insurers do not internalize the effect of their insurance policy on the pricing of medical goods. As a result, prices set under monopoly or oligopoly are too high in equilibrium, and there is room for limiting insurance coverage. In an environment with ==== moral hazard and linear reimbursement rates, this point has been proved first by Chiu (1997) for the case where demand for health care is perfectly (or sufficiently) inelastic==== and later by Vaithianathan (2006) who allows for elastic demand (but considers Cournot competition). In both papers, insurers cover a share of expenditures so that the reimbursement is proportional to the price.====In this paper, we re-consider the same game between insurers and a monopolistic health providers, but allow for two types of copayments used by insurers. In a first case, denoted ====, insurers use ==== copayment rates (also called coinsurance rates), that is copayment rates that are proportional to the value of health care consumed by the patient. This is the type of reimbursement considered in the papers mentioned in the previous paragraph. In a second case, referred to as ====, insurers use specific copayments, that is copayments that are proportional to the quantity consumed by the patient, but do not depend on the price. In both scenarios, the equilibrium concept is the same. As in the aforementioned papers, insurers compete by choosing a level of premium and a level of copayment for a given price of the medical product while the monopolist chooses its price taking as given the insurance policy chosen by insurers and both markets equilibrate simultaneously.====The medical product cum insurance markets we consider can be interpreted in two ways. The monopolistic producer is viewed as private and profit maximizing either way. As to the insurers, one can assume first that they are private and profit maximizing and that there is free entry and perfect competition in the insurance market. In equilibrium and absent of adverse selection, the equilibrium contract then maximize consumers’ expected utilities. The role of regulation is confined to the specification of the ==== of reimbursement (==== or ==== rule that is used. This is the main interpretation adopted for the writing of this paper.====Alternatively one could assume that there is a single public and welfare maximizing insurer but that it can only commit to the ==== of rule that is used and not to the specific ==== of reimbursement rates. Formally, both interpretations yield exactly the same game and thus the same results.====The main result of this paper is that under a very general specification of individual preferences, the level of individuals’ welfare is strictly higher when insurers compete on copayment rates as opposed to coinsurance rates. Our result stems from the fact that for a given copayment level paid by the insuree, the producer price chosen by a monopolist will be lower under specific reimbursement. However, the producer price decrease may not result in lower consumer price. In particular, when Bernoulli utility function exhibits decreasing absolute risk aversion – an assumption that fits the empirical literature, e.g. (see Friend and Marshall, 1975) — the consumer price may be lower with coinsurance rates.====We also consider two possible extensions to our analysis and show that our results remain valid. The first extension presented in Section 5.1 considers Cournot competition between health providers. Second, in Section 5.2 we assume that individuals differ not only ==== in their health status, but also ==== in their harm functions which express the impact of a given health status on utility.====The following four papers are the most closely related to our analysis. In the first of these papers, Gaynor et al. (2000) show that a lower producer price of medical good is always welfare superior, even if there is ==== moral hazard. Second, Bernt et al. (2011) analyzes the pharmaceutical firms response to different reimbursement rules. They concentrate on the supply side but do not study the response of the insurers. Third, Lakdawalla and Sood (2013) show that if the monopolist moves first and uses general nonlinear prices, the outcome of the market can lead to the same level of insurance coverage as under perfect competition, but in which the entire surplus is absorbed by the monopolist. Their result however rests on the strong assumption that the monopolist can choose both quantity and price. Finally, Cremer et al. (2016) consider a setting in which a public insurer moves first. They show that a suitable regulation of the copayment instruments leads to the same reimbursement rule as under perfect competition for medical products. In contrast to these two latter contributions, we study the equilibrium of a market in which neither the insurance companies nor the provider of the medical good can commit to their policy, so that the equilibrium of the market is a Nash equilibrium in which insurers choose their insurance policy for a given price of the medical good and the monopolist chooses its price for a given level of insurance policy.====By analogy with the industrial economics literature one can think of Cremer et al. (2016) as a setting where the regulator or national insurer is a Stackelberg leader with full commitment power. In the current model, commitment is limited and when it comes to the level of reimbursement the insurer is simply a Nash competitor. While Cremer et al. (2016) and Lakdawalla and Sood (2013) are useful as normative benchmark, it is known from the regulation literature that commitment to specific levels such as caps on prices is difficult to enforce in a credible way (because the outcome is not subgame perfect and both parties would benefit from renegotiation). Consequently, these papers and the current one are complementary and interestingly, while the specification of the game differs, both yield similar results in that they point to the superiority of copayments (per unit reimbursement) over ==== rules, even when it yields a higher consumer price====Our results are consistent with the empirical literature. Specific copayments can indeed be interpreted as reference pricing. In its extreme form, the reference pricing mechanism sets a fixed level of reimbursement per unit of product. Above this level, the patient pays the difference between the producer price and the fixed level of reimbursement. Recent evidence shows that the introduction of this policy yields a significant decrease in producer price (e.g., see Aouada, Brown, Whaley, 2019, Robinson, Brown, 2013, Whaley, Brown, 2018). All these empirical papers show that the reaction function of the producer is such that exogenous reference pricing yields a lower producer price. Our analysis shows that while this does not necessarily translate into a lower consumer price individual’s expected utility is always larger.====In practice, the reference price can be endogenous or exogenous. An endogenous reference price can be for instance the lowest price within a therapeutic class of drugs within a given country. Exogenous reference prices, on the other hand are based on prices in other countries. Our analysis focuses on medical good offered by a monopolist or a standard good for which there are no close substitutes so that endogenous reference pricing is not relevant. Examples of such goods include surgical services (Aouada et al., 2019), colonoscopies (Whaley and Brown, 2018) and orthopedic surgery (Robinson and Brown, 2013) and drugs which are still covered by patent protection. Exogenous reference pricing has been widely used in Europe; see for instance Kavanos et al. (2020). By contrast, Brekke, Holmås, Rune, 2011, Brekke, Königbauer, Rune, 2007 or Bardey et al. (2016) concentrate on ==== reference pricing for pharmaceutical products (i.e., a market where the princeps and generics coexist).

In particular, medical malpractice (“med mal”) liability may provide incentives for physicians and hospitals to devote greater efforts to patient safety. However, there is limited empirical evidence on the extent to which tort liability risk affects patient outcomes. Much of that work focuses on mortality or childbirth as the outcomes of interest. In this paper, we study the effect of med mal liability on patient safety in hospitals across a broader set of outcome measures. We analyze the adoption of med mal reforms involving caps on noneconomic damages (“nonecon caps”) in five states between 2003 and 2005. We interpret these reforms as plausibly exogenous shocks that reduce the risk of med mal liability. We assess whether, as tort law theory predicts, this reduction in liability leads to a higher rate of adverse patient safety events.====For measures of patient safety, we use Patient Safety Indicators (“PSIs”) – measures of often-preventable adverse events in acute care hospitals, developed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (“AHRQ”). Most of these adverse events are non-fatal. We apply the PSI definitions to patient-level hospital discharge data. We use a difference-in-differences (“DiD”) research design. Recent research raises concerns about potential bias in standard DiD regressions that involve using panel data with unit and time fixed effects when treatment occurs at different times and the treatment effect appears gradually over time (e.g., De Chaisemartin and D’Haultfoeuille, 2022; Goodman-Bacon, 2021). To address this concern, when reporting results pooled across states, we apply the stacked DiD regression estimator (Baker, Larcker, and Wang, 2021; Cengiz et al., 2019).====We find evidence of an increase in adverse patient safety events following damage cap adoption across multiple PSI measures, including measures that combine related PSIs, consistent with hospitals reducing investments in patient safety. Across states and PSIs, we find an increase of about 15%, on average, in adverse events after reform. We find little change, however, in two PSIs related to mortality. In effect, we find evidence of a higher rate of adverse patient safety events after med mal reform, but the additional adverse events are usually not serious enough to result in death. Our non-results for mortality are consistent with prior studies of whether med mal reform affects patient mortality (see the review by Mello et al., 2020).====We also innovate in methodology. We have data for only five reform states and state sizes vary greatly. Thus, standard inference methods may be unreliable (Conley and Taber, 2011; MacKinnon and Webb, 2017; Spamann, 2020). We address these limitations by developing a nonparametric, randomization inference approach that takes advantage of the availability of multiple, potentially correlated outcomes. We compute, for each state, the number of outcomes for which adverse event rates rise after reform and compare the number of increases with the distribution of the number of increases for all combinations of five control states, chosen at random from the control states in our sample. This nonparametric approach confirms that it is highly unlikely that the rise in PSI rates in reform states can be explained by random fluctuations.====To our knowledge, our study is the first, not only for med mal but for personal injury liability generally, to find strong evidence that a reduction in liability risk leads to a reduction in safety. Moreover, the effect we estimate is meaningful – a 15% increase in adverse patient safety events across PSIs, on average. The rise in adverse events is consistent with general deterrence, in which lower liability risk leads providers to invest less in safety and to be less careful in general. General deterrence may coexist with specific deterrence for the PSIs that are likely to lead to malpractice claims – a question we do not directly study.====We also address an alternative interpretation of our results: perhaps adverse events do not change after tort reform, but providers instead become more willing to report the events that occur. Hospitals have some discretion in reporting adverse events (Farmer, Black, and Bonow, 2013), and we cannot fully rule out this channel. However, we discuss why this story is unlikely to explain our results. Moreover, to the extent this interpretation were true, this too would be an important finding, because it would cast doubt on the reliability of standard measures of hospital safety, including those we study here.====Prior studies have generally found little evidence that med mal liability affects patient safety and healthcare outcomes. The review by Mello et al. (2020) reports that “most studies found no association between measures of malpractice liability risk and healthcare quality and outcomes.” In particular, Frakes and Jena (2016) find no evidence of an impact of damage caps on mortality, readmissions, or cancer screening but find evidence that a change from a local to a national standard of care leads to improvements in these outcomes in states that previously had below-average local standards. We reconcile our results with Frakes and Jena below. Appendix A provides a survey of the prior literature.====This paper proceeds as follows. Part II provides background on the med mal reforms we study. Part III describes our data and measures of patient safety. Part IV outlines our empirical strategy and Part V presents the results. Part VI develops a randomization inference-based approach to inference that confirms the statistical strength of our findings.

These frameworks can produce different social preference rankings of interventions depending on how their health effects and costs are distributed in a population. This paper derives social values of marginal decreases in the probability of illness, its severity (decrease in health status), ","Quantifying the value to society of improving health is important for allocation of health and safety resources, including health-care spending, public-health interventions, and environmental, health, and safety regulations. Social values of health interventions are most often assessed using cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) or benefit-cost analysis (BCA). Alternatively, values can be assessed using a social-welfare function (SWF). The rankings of health interventions produced by these evaluation frameworks can conflict, depending on the interventions’ effects on different dimensions of the risk (e.g., prevention or treatment) and characteristics of the people who benefit (e.g., age or wealth).====Applications of CEA and BCA to evaluate health interventions are ubiquitous. CEA is most often used to evaluate health-care and public-health interventions while BCA is most often used to evaluate environmental, health, and safety regulations. SWFs are used in the optimal tax and climate-economics literatures (Tuomala 2016, Botzen and van den Bergh 2014) but rarely to evaluate health risks; recent work examines the implications of using SWFs for valuing reductions in mortality risk (Adler et al. 2014, 2021). This paper extends the use of SWFs to nonfatal health risks.====I analyze a one-period model in which an individual faces a risk of illness or injury that may prove fatal. An intervention can affect any of three dimensions of the health risk: the probability of suffering the impairment, the conditional mortality risk, and the severity of the impairment (degradation of health status or quality of life). The share of the cost of an intervention that is born by an individual decreases her wealth. The relative social values of decreasing (improving) each of these dimensions are compared under alternative evaluation frameworks, together with the sensitivity of the social values to the magnitudes of the risk dimensions and to individuals’ characteristics (wealth). In addition, the conditions under which the social value of reducing one dimension exceeds the social value of reducing another are determined (e.g., the conditions under which prevention is socially more valuable than treatment).====I evaluate the demand for health interventions (i.e., their value relative to cost). Whether an intervention is socially desirable depends on how much it decreases health risk relative to its cost. An inexpensive intervention that modestly improves health can be socially preferred to an expensive intervention that produces a larger improvement. Moreover, an intervention that provides less total health can be preferred to another if it distributes the health gains more equitably. The five evaluation frameworks considered are BCA, CEA, and three “benchmark” SWFs: utilitarian, ex ante prioritarian, and ex post prioritarian.====Evaluation of health interventions must account for social concerns about efficiency (providing the most benefit for the cost) and distribution of effects across individuals. Distributional effects can be characterized in terms of the extent of inequality of some relevant dimension such as wellbeing, health, or income. Inequality aversion (with respect to some dimension) is defined as a preference for mean-preserving contractions in the distribution of that dimension (i.e., transfers from individuals with more to individuals with less). Inequality neutrality is defined as indifference to the distribution of a fixed total of the dimension.====A key difference between SWFs and the two most commonly used frameworks, BCA and CEA, is the way in which they aggregate effects across individuals. SWFs are functions of some measure of individual wellbeing (e.g., utility). The utilitarian SWF sums individual wellbeing while prioritarian SWFs sum wellbeing transformed by a strictly increasing and concave function. The utilitarian SWF is inequality neutral with respect to wellbeing (it is unaffected by how total wellbeing is distributed) while prioritarian SWFs are inequality-averse. The difference between the ex ante and ex post prioritarian SWFs is that the ex ante formulation depends on the sum of individuals’ transformed expected utilities while the ex post formulation depends on the expected value of the sum of individuals’ transformed realized utilities (as described in Section 2.2).====SWFs require an interpersonally comparable measure of wellbeing. Lacking an objective alternative, the measure and its dependence on individual circumstances must be assumed. Alternatives include von Neumann-Morgenstern utility functions, subjective wellbeing or life satisfaction, and capabilities, with additional assumptions to make them interpersonally comparable (Adler 2019, Adler 2022, Adler and Decancq 2022, Bossert and Weymark 2004, Deaton and Muellbauer 1980, Fleurbaey and Blanchet 2013) .====In contrast, BCA and CEA aggregate effects across individuals using more objective standards. BCA quantifies the effects of an intervention on each person's wellbeing by the individual's monetary value of the change, i.e., compensating or equivalent surplus. BCA counts a dollar of benefit as providing the same social value independently of how it is allocated. If the net social benefit of an intervention (the population sum of individuals’ monetary values) is positive, then the intervention creates a potential Pareto improvement because (in principle) money could be transferred from individuals who benefit to those who are harmed so that everyone would benefit from the combined intervention and transfer scheme. BCA attempts to separate efficiency from distribution with the view that decision makers can appropriately balance effects on efficiency and distribution. Alternatively, BCA can be justified as an approximation to a utilitarian SWF with the proviso that individuals’ monetary values must be weighted by their marginal utilities of wealth or income (e.g., Drèze and Stern 1987).====CEA quantifies costs and health effects using different units: costs are measured in monetary units and effects by some measure of health, often quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) or disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Hence costs are aggregated counting a dollar of cost as producing the same social harm, independently of who bears it, and health benefits are aggregated counting a QALY or DALY as providing the same social value, independent of its distribution. While perhaps inconsistent from a welfare perspective, CEA is often perceived as preferable to BCA because it counts health improvements as equally valuable independently of distribution, while BCA counts health benefits as more valuable if accruing to individuals with higher monetary values (typically those with greater wealth).====SWFs have been introduced to health economics as a method to formalize evaluation of the tradeoff between efficiency and equitable distribution of health (Wagstaff 1991, Dolan 1998). For this purpose, authors have used a restricted health-related SWF that is a function of individuals’ health and longevity rather than wellbeing (e.g., Williams 1997, Bleichrodt et al. 2004, Bleichrodt and van Doorslaer 2006, Dolan and Tsuchiya 2011). Health applications of prioritarian SWFs have typically assumed certainty about outcomes (e.g., Ottersen 2013) or adopted the ex ante form (Cookson et al. 2022). However Samson et al. (2018) apply both ex ante and ex post formulations and Leach (2010) adopts an ex post prioritarian SWF to compare public and private health insurance.====Section 2 introduces the model of health risk to an individual, shows how it is interpreted under the five evaluation frameworks, and further describes the differences among the evaluation frameworks. Section 3 derives the social value of a marginal decrease in each risk dimension and of a marginal increase in wealth (decrease in cost) under each of the evaluation frameworks. Section 4 compares the social values of decreasing each of the risk dimensions and Section 5 concludes.","Prevention, treatment, and palliative care: The relative value of health improvements under alternative evaluation frameworks",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629622000625,7 June 2022,2022,Research Article,61.0

This reduction is especially driven by a drop in emergency hospital admissions caused by injuries, which is the fourth most common cause of admission in our sample.==== Regarding primary care, LTC benefits decrease unscheduled ""walk-in"" patient visits by half, and this effect is sustained for up to 36 months. A back-of-the-envelope calculation, based on our estimates, suggests cost savings of 9.58 euros in these avoidable healthcare services for every 100 euros spent on LTC benefits.====These results are in line with existing evidence. Costa-Font et al. (2018) find that the introduction of the Spanish LTC system reduced hospital admissions for beneficiaries of homecare and caregiving allowances. Without patient-level administrative data, this study could not identify the most affected types of healthcare. Examining the same setting and using a similar identification strategy as the present paper, Hernández-Pizarro (2018) finds that access to more generous LTC benefits reduces mortality by 13 percentage points but does not estimate effects on healthcare use.====Outside of Spain, Kim and Lim (2015) look at the short-term impact of LTC on medical expenses in South Korea. They find heterogeneous effects depending on the type of care and levels of need. In their most similar estimation to ours, they find that eligibility for subsidised home care does not affect total medical costs nor hospital costs. Feng et al. (2020) estimate that the introduction of a pilot LTC insurance in Shanghai reduced total healthcare costs by 8.6 yuan for every yuan spent on LTC. Moura (2021) finds that the introduction of an LTC system based on subsidised nursing home care and home care teams reduced hospital bed-blocking in Portugal. In the UK, Gaughan et al. (2015) find that increasing the supply of nursing home beds reduced the number of delayed hospital discharges, while Crawford et al. (2021) show that lower public LTC spending increased hospital emergency department visits by older people. However, Liu et al. (2021) do not find any evidence that the supply of social care affected hospitalisation rates in the UK. Overall, most previous evidence shows a substitution of LTC for healthcare/hospital care and this is in line with our results.====Our paper expands this literature in several dimensions and provides important contributions. First, as compared to previous evidence in Spain (Costa-Font et al., 2018) we use patient-level administrative data, instead of survey data, which allows us to examine the effect of LTC on healthcare use in a more comprehensive way. In particular, we analyse the effect of LTC on healthcare use by type of admission/PC visit and for the main diagnosis groups. Second, as compared to the international literature, we are the first one to take into account the main diagnosis groups of the affected healthcare use by LTC. By doing so, we can identify avoidable admissions and primary care visits related to LTC provision, issues that have remained unexplored in the previous literature. This may help policymakers to design more efficient integrated health and social care systems by identifying in detail the interdependencies between the two systems. Lastly, we estimate the effect of LTC benefits by directly comparing those who receive LTC benefits vs those who do not receive any benefit providing a clear and policy-relevant estimate of the extensive margin effect of LTC benefits. This is in contrast with the identification strategies of previous literature mentioned above, which rely on differences in the intensity of LTC to estimate the effect of LTC on healthcare use.",Effects of long-term care benefits on healthcare utilization in Catalonia,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629622000649,30 May 2022,2022,Research Article,62.0

We find robust evidence of adverse health impacts, which has important policy implications in light of the substantial number of lead water pipes that remain in use as part of our aging infrastructure and the cost-benefit calculus of lead abatement interventions.","The recent crisis of drinking water contamination in Newark, New Jersey’s largest city, has renewed concerns regarding elevated lead levels in drinking water becoming a persistent and pervasive problem owing to the nation’s aging infrastructure. Indeed, the newly passed infrastructure bill (an approximately $1 trillion package) by the U.S. Congress (on November 5, 2021) allocates $15 billion over the next five years to states, tribes, and territories for replacing lead pipes in the U.S. drinking water systems. Corrosion of lead plumbing materials is the most common source of lead in drinking water. Although lead has been banned from use in new plumbing systems in the United States since 1986, much of the country’s drinking water infrastructure largely predates this ban (Brown, Margolis, 2012, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, (CDC)). Consequently, drinking water constitutes a significant source of lead exposure for Americans.====Lead is known to have bio-accumulative properties, collecting over time in the human body through repeated exposure and stored in the bones alongside calcium. Of particular concern is in utero exposure, since accumulated lead in a mother’s bones can be mobilized during pregnancy and released as a calcium substitute to aid in the formation of the bones of the fetus (Gulson, Jameson, Mahaffey, Mizon, Korsch, Vimpani, 1997, Hu, Hernandez-Avila, 2002). Lead in a mother’s blood can also easily cross the placenta, directly exposing the fetus to lead poisoning (Al-Saleh et al., 2011). There is no safe threshold of lead exposure that has been identified for children (American Academy of Pediatrics AAP, 2016, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, (CDC), Environmental Protection Agency EPA, 2020). Lead is a potent neurotoxin, and prenatal lead exposure is associated with impaired neurodevelopment, placing exposed children at higher risks for cognitive impairment, reduced IQ, learning disability, behavioral problems and other functional difficulties (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, (CDC), 2010, World Health Organization WHO, 2011).====Drinking water contamination is becoming an increasingly important and widespread source of prenatal exposure to environmental pollution. Between 2018 and 2020, nearly 30 million people received their drinking water from community water systems that were in violation of the EPA’s Lead and Copper Rule, which sets maximum enforceable levels of these metals in drinking water (Fedinick, 2021). Almost a third of community water systems report that at least some of their public service pipelines contain lead, with the exact number of lead service lines estimated to be between 6.1 and 10.2 million (Cornwell, Brown, Via, 2016, Environmental Protection Agency EPA, 2016a).==== Moreover, these lead service lines contribute as much as 75 percent of the lead that seeps into tap water (Sandvig et al., 2008).====In this study, we leverage a unique natural experiment provided by the 2016 water crisis in Newark, in order to identify the causal effect of prenatal exposure to lead-contaminated drinking water on fetal health. Specifically, we compare two groups of mothers whose homes are served by Newark’s two water treatment plants, respectively, over the period prior to and subsequent to the first discovery of lead contamination of drinking water in the city, which happened in March 2016.==== Of the two groups, one was exposed to elevated lead levels in drinking water because of an unintended consequence of one water treatment plant’s decision made in 2015 to increase the acidity level of its treated water. The unintended consequence of this increase in the acidity level was reduced effectiveness of the corrosion inhibitor (sodium silicate) used by the plant to control lead release. This caused lead from the pipes and plumbing fixtures to seep into the water, thereby exposing homes serviced by this water treatment plant to significantly elevated levels of lead in their tap water.====Using data on all live births in New Jersey between 2011 and 2019, we estimate the effects of prenatal exposure to lead contamination in drinking water on birth outcomes. A unique feature of our study is that we have data on the exact home addresses of pregnant women and the information on the spatial boundary of service areas between Newark’s two water treatment plants. We find robust evidence that prenatal lead exposure significantly raises the probability of low birth weight (LBW, birth weight < 2,500 g) by about 1.5 percentage points (or 18 percent) as well as the probability of a preterm birth (gestational length < 37 weeks) by about 1.9 percentage points (or 19 percent). There is little indication that these effects are driven by selection into births. We also find some notable dynamics in the response that coincide with how the Newark water crisis unfolded, and some evidence indicative of mitigation behavior including pregnant women in affected areas seeking out greater prenatal care in response to the water crisis. The effects on fetal health that we capture are the ones of a shift in water quality, including biological effects and effects of avoidance or compensatory behaviors conditional on any increased use of prenatal care which we control for.====Our study is directly relevant in informing how lapses in water quality due to a failure in the water system’s infrastructure—which have become increasingly more prevalent and a target of recent policy proposal—translates into population ill-health. The extent of these population-level health effects remains unclear, as they depend on avoidance behaviors of the mother, the level of exposure, and other factors that may regulate the body’s absorption of lead (such as micronutrient inadequacies or maternal health endowment). Moreover, lead exposure among women of childbearing age has fallen substantially over the past four decades with regulations limiting lead emissions (Ettinger et al., 2020). With average blood lead levels being quite low in the modern era, it is uncertain how a shock to water quality, which exposes these mothers to higher levels of lead, would affect their pregnancy outcomes.====Our study makes several contributions to the literature. We provide the first evidence of the impact of the Newark water crisis on birth outcomes. In the process, we add to the very limited evidence base on the adverse effects of water pollution, and specifically on the effects of prenatal exposure to lead in drinking water—a dearth underscored by Keiser and Shapiro (2019) and by the CDC in its report on lead exposure among pregnant women (CDC, 2010).==== Even recent evidence from the Flint water crisis on infant health outcomes has been somewhat mixed (Abouk, Adams, 2018, Grossman, Slusky, 2019, Wang, Chen, Li, 2021). In contrast to these studies of the Flint water crisis, which rely on intra-state comparisons between Flint and other cities in Michigan, the nature of the cause of the water crisis in Newark allows us to exploit plausibly exogenous within-city variation across affected and non-affected households within Newark.====While Newark provides the natural experiment in this study, failure to upgrade the nation’s aging water infrastructure has made lead in the water system a national problem, and prompted predictive warnings that Newark’s lead-water crisis will not be the nation’s last (Khazan, 2019).==== Our study also broadly contributes to the fetal origins literature, regarding effects of in utero shocks on health (Almond, Currie, 2011, Barker, 1995). With fetal health being an important predictor of later-life outcomes, these estimates are critical towards evaluating the cost-benefit calculus of infrastructure investments, including replacing all of the nation’s lead service lines, an initiative supported by the EPA (EPA, 2019) and a need finally recognized in the newly passed infrastructure bill by the U.S. Congress in November 2021.",Lead in drinking water and birth outcomes: A tale of two water treatment plants,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629622000637,27 May 2022,2022,Research Article,63.0

When a ==== admissions at Portuguese hospitals during 2000–2015, I find that the entry of home care teams in a region reduces bed-blocking by 4 days per episode, on average. Nursing home entry only reduces bed-blocking among patients with high care needs or when the intensity of entry is high. Reductions in bed-blocking do not harm patients’ health. The beds freed up by reducing bed-blocking are used to admit additional elective patients.","A significant, growing share of resources in developed countries is allocated to the healthcare sector. This has raised concerns about waste and inefficiency in healthcare among economists and policy-makers. However, identifying specific sources of inefficiency and potential improvements is challenging (Einav et al., 2019). The World Health Organization considers excessive length of hospital stay as one of the leading sources of inefficiency in healthcare (World Health Organization, 2010).====One reason for excessive length of hospital stay is lack of alternative care arrangements following a hospitalization. When a patient is clinically fit to be discharged but requires some support outside the hospital, such as a stay at a nursing home facility or home-help, which is not readily available, they cannot be safely discharged. The patient remains hospitalized until a safe discharge is possible, resulting in a longer length of stay —a phenomenon referred to as bed-blocking (Holmås et al., 2013).====Bed-blocking is associated with higher hospital costs, has potentially detrimental impacts on patients’ health originating from increased risks of mobility loss, hospital-acquired infections, and loneliness, and can create delays for patients awaiting elective care (Mur-Veeman and Govers, 2011).====Bed-blocking is a growing policy concern in developed countries. The significant increase in life expectancy during the last decades implies a rising share of the elderly in the population. Elderly people are more likely to need support following a hospitalization, which puts pressure on existing institutional arrangements within the health system (Harper, 2014). Social trends, such as the rise in female labor force participation and the decline of multi-generational households, in turn, threaten existing informal care arrangements (Lakdawalla and Philipson, 2002).====I investigate whether, and to what extent, the availability of publicly subsidized nursing homes (NH) and teams providing home care (HC) reduces hospital bed-blocking in Portugal. Existing estimates for Portugal suggest that, on a random day in 2019, 4.7% of beds in public hospitals were occupied with patients who were ready to be discharged but were awaiting support outside the hospital. These estimates amount to over 80,000 delayed bed-days and imply a cost burden of € M83 for public hospitals in 2019.====My empirical analysis relies on a difference-in-differences framework, exploiting two distinct sources of variation. First, it exploits plausibly exogenous variation across regions and time in the availability of NH and HC teams. Second, it exploits variation between patients who live in the same region and are admitted to the hospital in the same time period, but have different propensities to bed-block.====Variation in the availability of NH and HC teams across regions and time originates from the staggered implementation of a policy reform. Before 2006, such services were not within the scope of the National Health Service and individuals relied almost exclusively on informal care provided by family members. In 2006, the government introduced a network of publicly subsidized NH and teams providing HC to fill in this gap in service coverage. NH and HC teams belonging to this network operate in coordination with hospitals to ease patients’ transition out of the hospital. The network was introduced in a staggered fashion, so that different regions experienced the entry of NH and HC teams at different points in time, as centrally determined by the government.====Using individual data on the universe of emergency inpatient admissions at Portuguese public hospitals for the period 2000–2015, I proxy for patients at increased risk of bed-blocking from the presence of social factors that might hinder a timely discharge. These social factors include, for example, the lack of informal support in the community or inadequate housing conditions (i.e. lack of home adaptations). A key identifying assumption underlying the empirical approach is that patients who do not exhibit social factors are assumed not to be at risk of bed-blocking and patients who exhibit social factors are assumed to be at risk of bed-blocking. I provide support for this assumption by showing that the presence of these social factors is associated with substantially longer hospital stays, even after controlling for demographics, comorbidities, and medical diagnoses. I discuss the plausibility and implications of this assumption in later sections of the paper. To ease exposition, throughout the paper I refer to patients who exhibit social factors as bed-blockers, as opposed to regular patients, who exhibit no social factors.====In the baseline analysis, I compare the length of stay of bed-blockers and the length of stay of regular patients, before and after the entry of the first NH and HC team in their region of residence. Since most regions experience the entry of multiple NH and HC teams over time, my estimates capture the effects of having ==== HC team and NH facility in the region of residence on length of stay. To ease exposition, throughout the paper, the term ==== means that at least one NH/HC team has entered the region.====My baseline results show that the entry of HC teams in a region reduces the length of stay of bed-blockers relative to regular patients by 4 days, on average. No effects of NH entry on bed-blocking are found in the baseline analysis. However, heterogeneity analyses show effects of NH entry on bed-blocking when the number or capacity of entrants is high and for patients with high care needs, such as those with a stroke diagnosis. This latter finding is consistent with NH admissions requiring higher levels of disability and dependence. Finally, the entry of NH and HC teams has a precise zero impact on the length of stay of regular patients. Thus, reductions in the length of stay of bed-blockers relative to regular patients originate only from reductions in the length of stay of bed-blockers.====Event-study plots do not typically convey differential trends between the length of stay of bed-blockers and regular patients in the periods preceding the entry of NH and HC teams in a region. Using the imputation estimator by Borusyak et al., 2021 to address concerns about the staggered nature of the entry of NH and HC teams yields results that are very similar to the baseline results.====Consistent with the longer length of stay of bed-blockers being wasteful, I find no reduction in the intensity of treatment received by bed-blockers during their hospital stay after the entry of NH and HC teams. I also find no increase in the likelihood of a hospital readmission. Finally, the beds freed up by bed-blockers do not remain unoccupied: I find evidence of an increase in the number of programmed admissions upon the entry of HC teams in a region.====This paper relates to several strands of the economics literature.==== First and foremost, it relates to a growing literature studying the impacts of NH and HC availability on hospital bed-blocking (Forder, 2009, Gaughan, Gravelle, Santos, Siciliani, 2017, Gaughan, Gravelle, Siciliani, 2015, Gaughan, Gravelle, Siciliani, 2017, Holmås, Islam, Kjerstad, 2013, Walsh, Lyons, Smith, Wren, Eighan, Morgenroth, 2020). I make several contributions to this literature. First, I use exogenous variation to identify the causal effects of NH and HC teams on bed-blocking. Existing studies often lacked a clean source of exogenous variation. The policy reform that I exploit allows analyzing the effects of both NH and HC teams, whereas existing studies focused on a single type of provider (usually NH). My findings show that HC teams are a more successful policy tool to reduce bed-blocking than NH. Second, I proxy for bed-blockers using information on social needs. Medical scholars have noted that bed-blocking does not only affect the elderly or those with complex clinical conditions (Pellico-López et al., 2019) and emphasized the role of social needs (McDonagh et al., 2000). However, existing studies in economics often restrict their analysis to specific populations (e.g. the elderly, stroke patients), and neglect the role of social needs. Third, I assess the impact of reducing bed-blocking on the intensity of care received and readmissions. Due to data limitations, existing studies were not able to investigate these effects.====A related literature focuses on the substitutability of acute hospital care and care provided by NH or HC teams. Most of this literature examines if care provided by NH and HC teams can delay or avoid the need for hospital care and finds little to no substitution between these settings of care (Bakx, Wouterse, van Doorslaer, Wong, 2020, Costa-Font, Jimenez-Martin, Vilaplana, 2018, Gonçalves, Weaver, 2017, Kümpel, 2019, McKnight, 2006). I contribute to this literature by studying an alternative form of substitution between acute care and care provided by NH or HC teams. I am interested on whether care provided by NH and HC teams can be used in lieu of (the last days of) a hospital stay, particularly for patients who do not seem to need acute care anymore.====My finding that reductions in bed-blocking lead to increases in programmed admissions relates to a discussion on the internal allocation of resources within a hospital, which dates back to Harris (1977). Hospital inputs, such as beds or staff, can be used for emergency admissions and for elective admissions. If hospital inputs are fixed in the short run and there are waiting lists for elective care, then a reduction in bed-blocking would free up beds that could be used for admitting additional elective patients who are on waiting lists (Johar et al., 2013). I provide evidence of such reallocation of beds from emergency to elective care.====Finally, and more broadly, this paper relates to recent work zooming in on specific aspects of the healthcare sector to identify sources of waste and inefficiency. A large part of this literature focuses on interactions between the acute care and the nursing home settings (Doyle Jr, Graves, Gruber, 2017, Einav, Finkelstein, Mahoney, 2018, Eliason, Grieco, McDevitt, Roberts, 2018, Kümpel, 2019, Einav et al., 2019, Jin et al., 2018). I contribute to this literature by investigating whether the entry of NH and HC teams helps reducing inefficiencies associated with bed-blocking in the acute-care setting. My baseline estimates suggest that the availability of HC teams generates a 27% reduction in annual bed-blocking costs incurred by hospitals.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the institutional setting. Section 3 describes the data and Section 4 describes the empirical approach.

Consistent with an exchange motive for intergenerational transfers, we estimate an average 17 pp (8.2-8.7pp) increase (decrease) in downstream (upstream) transfers among those receiving caregiving allowances. Our estimates resulting from the reduction in the allowances and supports after the ==== cuts in 2012 are consistent with our main estimates, and suggest stronguer effects among lower-income families.","The public subsidisation of long-term care is more restricted than that of other social services. Although informal caregiving is still the main source of support for the elderly (Arno et al., 1999; Rodrigues et al., 2013), we know little about how cash subsidies (which we refer to also as ‘allowances’) and (home care) supports impact on family arrangements. Demand-side cash subsidies are often presented as a less costly alternative to the expansion of community care services. Such cash subsidies enable families to either purchase care in the market or compensate caregivers for their opportunity cost (Carmichael et al., 2010).==== However, it is unclear whether such allowances, or an alternative network of home care supports, alter household decisions such as the supply of care==== or intergenerational transfers.====To date, there is limited quasi-experimental evidence on economic incentives influencing the supply of care and other related household decisions. An exception is the study by Kim and Lim (2015), who examine the effect that the demand for subsidies to access both formal and institutional care have on informal care in South Korea==== (section two summarises the related literature on demand-side subsidies). We study evidence from the unforeseen introduction==== of an unconditional universal allowance (a cash subsidy), and a system of home care supports for the entire Spanish population in January 2007 (SAAD).==== We examine the effect these cash allowances and home care supports have on the extensive margin of both the supply of informal care and intergenerational transfers (both upstream and downstream); in other words, we distinguish between the effects of a cash allowance (paid into the care recipient's bank account) of up to €530/month in 2011 (nominal euros) after a needs test,==== and those of a network of publicly funded homecare benefits that led to a threefold increase in the number of monthly caregiving hours compared to the pre-reform period.====A unique feature of the Spanish reform is that it gave rise not to just one but to two quasi-experiments. Indeed, in July 2012 austerity reforms reduced the SAAD allowance (by about 25%), as well as the intensity of public homecare benefits (between 14% and 25% in care hours). Such additional intervention allows testing whether the partial reversion of the incentives yields consistent effects.====We use four waves of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe from 2004-2013, covering the introduction and reduction of both caregiving allowances and benefits. To further test the robustness of our results, we compare both the ordinary least squares (OLS) and an instrumental variable (IV) to estimate how far the reform's implementation might have been influenced by potential omitted variables.==== A final section reports several robustness exercises, as well as estimates on the SAAD's economic impact.====We contribute to the literature in the following ways; first, we report that the introduction of an unconditional caregiving allowance increased the extensive margin of both the provision of informal care and intergenerational transfers (both upstream and downstream). More specifically, we estimate a 17.3 pp increase in the extensive margin of informal caregiving, a 14.5 pp increase in the probability of downstream intergenerational transfers, and a 7.3 pp reduction in the probability of upstream transfers====. In contrast, the expansion of subsidised homecare benefits ==== change the provision of informal care. The effects on caregiving are consistent with an absence of substitution (Stabile et al., 2006; Bremer et al., 2017), or complementarity (Langa et al., 2001; Bakx et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2017) between formal and informal care. The effects on intergenerational transfers are in line with Norton and Van Houtven (2006) and Alessie et al. (2014), suggesting an underlying exchange motivation for intergenerational transfers.====Second, we show that the reduction in the allowance amidst austerity cuts in 2012 led to the reverse effect, although in contrast to previous studies (Golberstein et al., 2009; Karlsberg-Schaffer, 2015), we do not find any evidence to show that a reduction in benefits leads to an increase in informal care. Third, we report that the effect of the allowance differs across individual household income quintiles, kinship relationships, and co-residence between caregiver and care recipient.====Our results are robust to different samples, specifications, and other checks. We estimate that the economic impact of caregiving allowances for the period 2007-2011 amounted to 19.5% of total SAAD expenditure. Finally, the paper adds to the literature on the impact of SAAD over and above the effect on hospital admissions (Costa-Font et al., 2018), wealth and savings (Costa-Font and Vilaplana-Prieto, 2017) as well as retirement intentions (Costa-Font and Vilaplana-Prieto, 2022), and provides evidence of how household decisions are altered by a system of caregiving allowances.====The next section discusses how this paper relates to the previous literature.

The resulting prices are dispersed and often opaque, a fact that is often blamed on the peculiarities of healthcare, including provider concentration. Yet across many industries, we see similarly dispersed prices that reflect, to some degree, differential investments in quality rather than simply increased concentration.====High hospital prices may indeed reflect previous consolidation that has reduced the set of outside options. In fact, the literature demonstrates that mergers in the hospital market raise prices with little consistent evidence of improved quality or reduced costs (Beaulieu et al., 2020; Capps and Dranove, 2004; Cooper et al., 2018; Dafny, 2009). While this literature may serve as evidence against quality-based justifications for additional merger activity, it does not speak to the question of the broader determinants of price variation in the hospital market. In this paper, we focus on alternative drivers of (unregulated) prices, driven by patient demographics. In doing so, we can focus on the response of hospitals to the strategic investment incentives they face.====High hospital prices could also reflect an unobservably different cost structure or a willingness to pay for quality. Existing studies examining rising hospital prices largely fail to consider this interaction between pricing and the provider’s quality investment decision. Similarly, healthcare policy analyses largely ignore the possibility that prices and quality are jointly determined – an omission that could have meaningful policy ramifications. In this paper we investigate the relationship between prices and quality in the hospital market.====While a number of studies examine rising hospital prices, this literature largely does not consider the interaction between pricing and the provider’s qualtiy investment decision. Similarly, healthcare policy analyses largely ignore the possibility that prices and quality are jointly determined. Of the 19 papers cited in a Kaiser Family Foundation literature review on the determinants of healthcare pricing, only 4 evaluated quality. Both White and Whaley (2019) and Cooper et al. (2018) document that high-priced hospitals tend to be higher quality than low-priced hospitals but do not discuss why or how that relationship occurs. Wu and Shen (2014) show that large administrative price cuts gradually lead to slower improvement in patient outcomes. Gaynor et al. (2015) provides a review of the literature examining the effect of competition separately on prices and quality where the authors separate studies into markets with administered prices and markets with market determined prices. By contrast, the hospital bargaining literature generally takes hospital quality as fixed and models network formation and pricing, premium setting, and consumer demand (Gowrisankaran et al., 2015; Ho, Lee, 2017, Ho, Lee, 2018). Our study fills a void by exploring the mechanism connecting prices and quality investments. In this paper we investigate the relationship between prices and quality in the United States (U.S.) hospital market. There is little existing evidence about the presence of an economic relationship between administrative prices and quality.====To help understand the relationship between prices and quality, we develop and empirically validate a simple economic framework examining strategic hospital investments in costly quality. These investments are intended to increase the willingness to pay of privately insured patients with the goal of influencing negotiations with commercial insurers. In contrast, public insurer prices are broadly similar across hospitals and importantly are not responsive to quality. Intuitively, if the marginal consumer is more likely to be publicly insured, then the hospital’s quality choice will depend on the incentives generated by the public insurance program. By contrast, if the marginal consumer is more likely to be privately insured, then quality will reflect the incentives generated by those patients.====The framework suggests equilibrium quality will be higher in markets with more private patients. In such markets, hospitals may set quality sufficiently high that the cost of serving public patients exceeds the associated reimbursement.==== Such a strategy is not viable for hospitals in markets with a greater share of publicly insured patients. Those hospitals cannot persistently lose money and must instead optimize under the fixed public insurer prices. Such a relationship between potential market opportunities and product quality is not unique to healthcare. Waldfogel (2003) notes that firms offer products attracting a large base of (profitable) customers. The growing literature on endogenous product design (see Crawford (2012) for a review) shows that the welfare effects of such endogenous quality choice can be comparable to that of pricing.====Testing our prediction that hospitals with a greater opportunity to attract higher paying privately insured patients will provide higher quality requires estimating a firm’s belief about potential market opportunities. The actual payer mix at a hospital is the equilibrium outcome of, among other things, investments in quality. To avoid the endogeneity concerns that would result from using a hospital’s actual payer mix as a measure of potential market opportunities, we measure a firm’s beliefs about its potential patients based on the demographics of a hospital’s close geographic region. This measure relies on the assumption that geographic distance is an economically meaningful component of facility selection, as has been seen across a number of studies (Geweke et al., 2003a; Kessler and McClellan, 2000; McClellan et al., 1994). It also leverages the fact that general acute care hospitals are long-standing institutions that face similar local demographics over the timescale in which quality investment decisions are evaluated.====We examine the relationship between the potential patient mix and a wide variety of quality measures including overall patient satisfaction, hospital processes, risk adjusted mortality, revealed patient preferences, hospital technology adoption, physician quality, and ED wait times. Fig. 1 and Table 2 demonstrate a strong and consistent relationship between potential patient mix and these quality measures. There may be a concern that this relationship simply reflects other characteristics of the privately insured that bias our quality measures. We note that, where appropriate, these quality measures are risk adjusted. While there may be some concern about the completeness of this risk adjustment, we also highlight that some of our measures, such as the measure of optimal hospital processes, do not require risk adjustment and therefore are immune to concerns they simply reflect some underlying characteristic of the privately insured.====To further examine whether the consistent relationship between patient mix and our quality measures might by driven by other characteristics of the market or of privately insured patients, we next examine hospital financial data. Because public prices do not vary with quality, costly investments in quality should decrease the accounting margins hospitals earn from treating publicly insured patients. For this reason, we predict hospitals investing in quality because their marginal expected consumer is privately insured should have lower public Medicare accounting margins and higher prices from private payers. In this scenario, we would predict a negative correlation between public and private accounting margins, which is precisely what we observe in the binned scatter plot in Fig. 2A. If, by contrast, the relationship between potential payer mix and quality is driven by unobserved characteristics of privately insured patients or the market, we would not expect to observe such a negative correlation.====Other authors have identified a similar negative correlation, but have suggested it was primarily driven by inefficient managers flush with profits from the private markets. Models of inefficient management are driven by different economic mechanisms. For example, Stensland et al. (2010) posit that increased costs for hospitals receiving higher private prices solely result from a softening of pressure on hospital managers to control costs. We, however, suggest higher costs are a byproduct of the incentive to invest in quality to increase private patient demand. If this correlation represents waste, there should be no systematic relationship between potential private patients and quality. Our results are also inconsistent with a model of mechanical reinvestment of surplus. Fig. 2B shows that for-profit hospitals, which can return excess surplus to investors, also exhibit a negative correlation between Medicare and non-Medicare accounting margins.==== Finally, we note that our analysis is positive, not normative, i.e. we do not comment on the optimal or efficient quality level.We do not model how quality is generated nor argue that the correlations we measure are policy invariant. Given both theoretical ambiguity and market frictions, it is impossible to say whether quality is over- or under-provided in equilibrium.==== However, if private margins are a byproduct of costly quality investments in search of higher private prices, they imply that changes to reimbursement policy would alter the equilibrium quality investment.====Below we discuss our model and estimates in more detail and discuss the economic implications of potential private price regulation in light of our evidence of a price-quality relationship. We do, however, note that factors beyond pure clinical quality likely drive consumer willingness-to-pay and providing higher levels of that type of quality is not necessarily evidence of quality overprovision or waste.",Endogenous quality investments in the U.S. hospital market,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629622000558,14 May 2022,2022,Research Article,66.0

Following the rule change, surgeons began reallocating both Medicare and commercially insured patients to ASCs. Specifically, physicians became 70% more likely to use ASCs for the policy-targeted procedure among their non-Medicare patients. These novel findings demonstrate that Medicare rulemaking affects physician behavior beyond the program's statutory scope.","Medicare covers nearly 60 million individuals and directs roughly a fifth of the United States’ more than $3 trillion in annual healthcare spending.==== Traditional, or fee-for-service (FFS), Medicare enrollment also eclipses that of most other public or private health insurers. Consequently, the Medicare program looms large as a dominant payer in the US healthcare landscape and may influence physician treatment decisions as well as standards of care beyond its patient population and statutory bounds.====Prior research documents important spillover effects from Medicare fee schedules on price negotiations between private insurers and providers as well as on provider behavior toward non-Medicare patient populations.==== However, Medicare policy is broader than administrative pricing and often includes care delivery regulations. The impact of these latter policy levers—Medicare's nonprice regulatory decisions—on provider behavior inside and outside of the Medicare market is less well studied. To be clear, by nonprice, we mean Medicare rulemaking that is separate from service fee-setting and includes decisions such as which procedures and equipment are covered for Medicare patients, which facilities or providers can administer certain services, whether providers can balance bill, and so on. Recognizing and measuring externalities from such rules is necessary for formulating optimal Medicare policy and other healthcare regulation. Additionally, studying whether and how Medicare's nonprice regulatory decisions spill over onto physicians’ non-Medicare treatment decisions has the potential to shed new light on the formation and evolution of physician treatment styles, which is an area of longstanding interest (Phelps, 2000; Grytten and Sørensen, 2003; Epstein and Nicholson, 2009; Currie et al., 2016; Molitor, 2018; Cutler et al., 2019)—including how a given physician's treatment style converges or diverges across patients with different insurance (Newhouse and Marquis, 1978; Glied and Graff Zivin, 2002; Frank and Zeckhauser, 2007).====In this paper, we investigate Medicare's regulatory externalities on physicians’ medical decision-making for their non-Medicare (i.e., commercially insured) patients. In January 2008, Medicare reversed a prior regulatory stance that banned a specific surgical procedure from taking place within an ambulatory surgery center (ASC) for FFS Medicare patients. ASCs, also known as outpatient surgery centers or same-day surgery centers, are stand-alone, non-hospital facilities that are typically lower-cost treatment setting options for procedures not requiring an inpatient stay. Prior to 2008, Medicare would only pay for laparoscopic cholecystectomy surgeries (i.e., minimally invasive gallbladder removals) if these were administered within a hospital outpatient or inpatient department—effectively prohibiting Medicare cases within ASC settings.====The 2008 policy change by Medicare provides an ideal quasi-experiment to investigate spillovers from Medicare's nonprice regulation. As we describe below, the roll-back of Medicare's ban was purely an administrative change. It was not a response to changes in medical technology, perceived patient clinical benefits, or physician preferences. We also show that it did not coincide with the relaxing of other Medicare treatment setting restrictions for other procedures important to the affected surgeons. Instead, the original Medicare ban existed without a clear evidence-base and did not necessarily align with care delivery parameters stipulated by other payers or similar surgical services. The narrow application of the ban (laparoscopic cholecystectomy surgeries) also meant that only surgeons performing this specific operation were plausibly affected by its removal, which generates well-defined treatment and control physician groups. These features of the quasi-experiment, along with the sharp timing of the deregulation event, are useful in disentangling policy effects from underlying trends and allow us to ask whether a change to the permissible service delivery setting for Medicare patients ultimately impacted physicians’ choice of setting for ====, commercially insured patients receiving the same procedure.====A key institutional feature for our outpatient surgery context is that, when permitted by the relevant payer, physicians often divide their patients receiving the same surgical service between hospital outpatient department (HOPD) and ASC delivery settings, rather than operate solely within one. This behavior has been of economic interest, and David and Neuman (2011) usefully refers to such physicians as “splitters” since they split their relevant case load across facility types. David and Neuman (2011), along with Yee (2011) and Munnich and Parente (2018), examine what drives physician splitters to allocate the marginal patient to a particular facility type. Yet, surprisingly little economics research to date has examined the underlying determinants of a physician choosing to split a given procedure between ASC and HOPD options in the first place.==== In what follows, we demonstrate that Medicare regulation can have an immediate impact on physicians’ decisions to split outpatient surgeries for Medicare and non-Medicare cases alike.====To build on this literature, we analyze physicians’ decisions to split surgeries across settings as our primary outcome of interest. As we describe in more detail below, there are several reasons to expect that a physician's decision to begin using ASCs for some of her Medicare patients might be jointly made with her decision to begin using ASCs for some patients with other insurance coverage. To motivate this possibility, we note an empirical regularity: a physician's splitter status for her Medicare outpatient procedures is highly correlated with her splitter status for the same procedures paid for by commercial insurers. In our data (described below) and across all unique physician-procedure combinations in 2007, we observe that conditional on a physician behaving as a splitter for a given Medicare procedure, the probability that the same physician also divides her corresponding commercial procedure volume between HOPDs and ASCs is high (88%, see Fig. 1).==== Conditional on a physician not splitting a given Medicare procedure between settings, the probability that she nonetheless does so for the same procedure reimbursed by commercial insurers is low (16%). In principle, this within-physician, cross-payer correlation in surgical practice style could entirely reflect physician and patient preferences or the underlying complexity of the procedures with no feedback or spillovers to or from the Medicare program. Yet, in this paper, we show that this is not the case. We find that Medicare rules have a large causal impact on the care delivery setting chosen for non-Medicare patients, holding physicians and procedures fixed.====We establish the spillover effects of Medicare's deregulation change in the universe of outpatient procedure discharge records from Florida from 2005 through 2011. We first show a sharp uptick in the likelihood of splitting FFS Medicare laparoscopic cholecystectomy surgeries once Medicare removes the ASC ban for these surgeries.==== The impact is clearly visible in a simple difference-in-differences plot that compares surgeons who perform the procedure to other physicians over the relevant timeframe. This tendency to begin splitting the targeted Medicare surgeries between outpatient delivery settings (i.e., HOPDs and ASCs) is a direct and expected first-order policy effect and is consistent with physicians reoptimizing their choice of setting for Medicare patients after Medicare permits a new procedure-location combination.====After establishing the direct policy effect, we investigate the spillover effect of interest: physician-level splitter status for ====-Medicare patients receiving the same surgical procedure. By comparing surgeons who perform the targeted procedure in Medicare to all other physicians in a difference-in-differences framework, we show a 25% increase over pre-policy levels in the probability that a physician splits her ==== laparoscopic cholecystectomy surgeries during the first year of the ==== rule change. The effect grows and stabilizes to a 70% increase by the third post-policy year and thus reveals that the Medicare rule change had a substantial impact on how physicians provided care to non-Medicare patients.====Thus, our main contribution is to establish, for the first time, that Medicare regulation prohibiting certain modes of service provision substantially affects physician practice patterns for non-Medicare patient populations. The physician behavior changes we document have important implications beyond the narrow surgical procedure that we study. The same type of Medicare regulatory policy is in place (statically) for essentially every surgical procedure in US healthcare delivery—either prohibiting or permitting certain modes and places of care. These same rules are also an active source of contemporary debate and policy shifts.==== In this way, our identifying variation offers a rare opportunity to understand the broader impacts of this type of Medicare administrative decision-making, which can inform ongoing deliberations on related policies tied to a wider variety of medical services.====Our findings also contribute to an active literature on the externalities from public health insurance programs for the healthcare economy. This includes work on public insurance payments influencing private insurer payments (e.g., White, 2013; Clemens and Gottlieb, 2017; Clemens et al., 2017; Trish et al., 2017; Cooper et al., 2019), public insurance payments influencing physician behavior toward other patient groups (Sloan et al., 1988; Yip, 1998; He and Mellor, 2012; White, 2014; Meyers et al., 2019; Einav et al., 2020; Wilcock et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2022), and public payer reimbursements influencing drug development (Yurukoglu et al., 2017), among other outcomes. In contrast with prior work that has largely focused on administrative pricing,==== we provide novel evidence of Medicare's own- and cross-market effects from nonprice regulation. We also view our results as complementing a long literature on physician behavior and decision-making in a multi-payer environment (McGuire and Pauly, 1991).==== Extending this prior literature, our findings indicate that the regulatory environment interacts with physician decision-making even when the regulations do not directly bind. Our work consequently reveals the long reach of Medicare rulemaking and its ability to shape physician behavior and healthcare delivery beyond the statutory scope of the regulation.",Trading spaces: Medicare's regulatory spillovers on treatment setting for non-Medicare patients,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629622000431,14 May 2022,2022,Research Article,67.0

One possible reason is that the risk reductions presented to respondents are too small to be meaningful. Survey responses may thus not accurately reflect respondents preferences for health and safety. In this paper we propose a novel approach to estimating the value per statistical life (VSL) or the value per statistical case (VSC) based on larger risk reductions measurable as percent changes. While such non-marginal risk reductions are easier to understand, they introduce well known biases. We propose a methodology to de-bias VSL and VSC estimates derived from the evaluation of non-marginal risk reductions and present a proof of concept using simulated ==== data.","Evaluating policies that seek to improve risks to life and limb requires estimating the rate at which people trade money for a small change in the chance of dying or suffering an adverse health effect in a specified period. This marginal rate of substitution is commonly referred to as the value per statistical life (VSL) or the value per statistical case (VSC) of illness or injury. As these metrics enable the analyst to monetize mortality and morbidity risk reductions, they are crucial to regulatory impact analysis (Cameron, 2014, Cropper, Hammitt, Robinson, 2011).====In the context of environmental health and safety policies, VSL is often estimated using stated-preference (SP) studies that seek to mimic a market for mortality risk reductions. Most of these studies evaluate very small risk reductions—often as small as 1 in 100,000—to elicit VSL. The reason for choosing such small risk reductions is that VSL and VSC are marginal rates of substitution that differ from average rates of substitution for large risk changes. Moreover, under conventional assumptions, respondents’ willingness-to-pay (WTP) should be nearly proportional to the risk change for such small increments (Hammitt and Graham, 1999). This near-proportionality provides a useful test of scope sensitivity. Unfortunately, many VSL studies do not pass the test. In some studies, the estimated WTP is much less than proportional to the risk reduction—a violation of ==== scope sensitivity; in others, the estimated WTP is not even statistically related to the size of the risk reduction—a violation of ==== scope sensitivity.==== For example, fewer than 20% of the 405 VSL studies analyzed by Lindhjem et al. (2011) displayed at least weak sensitivity to the size of risk reduction.====There are at least two potential reasons for scope insensitivity. First, a lack of scope sensitivity may be related to the curvature of the indifference function between money and risk (Hammitt and Treich, 2007); second, it may reflect the difficulties that respondents have in understanding the small mortality risk reductions they are commonly asked to value (Baron, Hammitt, Graham, 1999, Kunreuther, Novemsky, Kahneman, 2001). To improve respondents’ understanding, numerous risk communication aids have been employed (Corso et al., 2001). However, while such aids may help in communicating risks, they do not overcome the core problem that marginal reductions in risk are an abstract benefit that is likely to be interpreted differently by different people (Rheinberger et al., 2018).====In this paper, we propose the use of non-marginal risk reductions to improve people’s understanding. The literature on risk communication suggests that, in addition to the description of risk, the size of risk changes influences understanding (Spiegelhalter, 2017). Larger risk reductions appear to be easier for researchers to explain, and for respondents to grasp and recall, than smaller risk reductions (Okan et al., 2020). For example, Garcia-Retamero and Galesic (2011) provide evidence that individuals are better able to comprehend and recall (after 3 weeks) cancer risks, if these are on the order of 1 in 100 rather than 1 in 1,000. The effect is more pronounced in low-numeracy individuals than in high-numeracy individuals, suggesting that the former group has particular problems in understanding small probabilities (Peters et al., 2011). This suggests that using non-marginal risk changes in SP studies may help people to better grasp the trade-offs they are asked to evaluate.====The size of risk reduction may influence individuals’ responses through a combination of various judgment processes. First, as individuals often consider small probability events too rare to pay attention to, the use of large probabilities can encourage them to take protective behavior by increasing the stakes above their threshold level of concern (Slovic et al., 1977). Second, as mortality (or morbidity) risks are often expressed on a yearly basis (e.g., as a 1 in 100,000 annual chance of dying) respondents may exhibit myopia, or narrow bracketing, in their decisions (Kahneman and Lovallo, 1993). That is, they focus on short time periods rather than recognizing the long-term impact of a cumulative annual risk. Recent evidence suggests that broad bracketing that conveys cumulative information about the distribution of possible outcomes of a gamble over a long period of time counters the narrow bracketing tendency (Chaudhry et al., 2020).====While moving to non-marginal risk reductions—i.e., risk changes in the percent range—seems promising, it comes at the cost of biasing the estimated VSL (or VSC). This is because VSL (and VSC) are defined as ==== rates of substitution between money and risk, which differ from ==== rates of substitution for non-marginal risk changes. Indeed, the marginal WTP for risk reduction decreases with the size of the risk reduction because of the individual’s budget constraint, an income effect (Jones-Lee, 1974). In addition, eliciting WTP for a non-marginal risk reduction requires a setting in which the baseline risk is large enough to make the proposed reduction meaningful (e.g., the lifetime risk of developing cancer). This can introduce an additional bias, because WTP for a marginal risk reduction is increasing in baseline risk (Pratt and Zeckhauser, 1996).==== This baseline risk effect arises because individuals facing a large probability of dying have little incentive to limit their spending on risk reduction, the so-called dead-anyway effect. Because of both effects, the rate of substitution for a large risk reduction does not coincide with the rate of substitution for an infinitesimally small risk reduction. Non-marginal risk reductions have therefore rarely been used to measure WTP in applied studies.====We develop a method that simultaneously corrects for income and baseline risk effects, allowing for unbiased VSL (or VSC) estimates from the evaluation of non-marginal risk reductions. The method is based on the WTP model for prevention-based and treatment-based health interventions developed by Rheinberger et al. (2016, RHH hereafter). As we assume that disease-induced mortality is conditional on suffering the disease, the model includes three health states: healthy, ill, and dead. This enables us to study trade-offs between incidence rate, mortality rate, and health quality. We derive two new theoretical results. First, we extend the RHH model by decomposing the WTP for reduced disease incidence into a weighted sum of the WTP for reductions in conditional mortality and the WTP for reducing the risk of a nonfatal course of disease. Second, we show that, when an intervention exists that simultaneously reduces incidence, severity and conditional mortality of a disease, WTP cannot be simultaneously proportional to infinitesimal reductions in each of the three components. Instead, WTP is proportional to each term’s contribution to the total WTP.====Based on these insights, we provide an empirically tractable method to extrapolate the incremental WTP for non-marginal risk reductions to the WTP for marginal risk reductions. This new methodology for estimating the VSL (or VSC) combines the relationship between the WTP for a risk reduction and the size of that risk reduction with information on the relationship between WTP and the individual’s baseline risk and income. To test the feasibility and accuracy of our proposed appoach, we use Monte Carlo analysis to simulate a stated-preference study of WTP to decrease incidence, severity and mortality risk in a setting similar to that of (Alberini and Ščasnỳ, 2018). As our results demonstrate, we are able to accurately recover the marginal WTP for different types of intervention—reduced risk of developing cancer, improvements in the 5-year survival chance conditional on having cancer, or both.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 introduces our workhorse model and derives the WTP for reductions in incidence, conditional mortality, and health deterioration. In Section 3 we present the setup of the Monte Carlo simulation. Section 4 reports on the accuracy with which our approach estimates the true values in the Monte Carlo simulation and Section 5 concludes.

Innovation of medical technology has been identified as the consensus catalyst for this growth, despite several policy efforts (Smith et al., 2009). Most policies and market evolutions have involved changes to health insurance, such as increased patient cost-sharing, managed care, prospective payment mechanisms, and, more recently, narrow provider networks and high-deductible health plans. None of these efforts have had a direct impact on innovation or the adoption of new technology, and therefore their effect has occasionally decreased the level of spending but not its growth rate (Chernew, Newhouse, 2011, Cutler, Mclellan, Newhouse, 2000, Manning, Newhouse, Duan, Keeler, Leibowitz, 1987, McWilliams, Hartfield, Chernew, Landon, Schwartz, 2016).====Given the limited success of these interventions, the question of whether society obtains enough value for the price of medical care continues to be an important question, and controversial in situations where the stakes are high for patients, payers, providers, and manufacturers (Lakdawalla et al., 2012). Some countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) have introduced centralized health technology assessment agencies to evaluate the value of new technology. The most prominent such institution is the United Kingdom’s National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), which employs cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) to assess a technology’s cost per incremental unit of benefit.==== Although the United States has no such system in place, periodically there are proposals to transition to a system of centralized medical technology value assessment that would allow public insurers such as Medicare to negotiate prices based on CEA evidence. (Frank and Nichols, 2019).====The relative simplicity of CEA as a tool for allocating scarce medical resources and its effectiveness at reducing spending explains its widespread use in European countries and why it is frequently considered for the U.S. However, using a single threshold to decide whether a particular technology is cost-effective is at odds with conventional economic models of demand, whose appeal is precisely to be able to capture the heterogeneity of different consumers’ values for a good. In fact, the heterogeneity of willingness to pay that is central to a demand function highlights that a homogeneous valuation does not exist, unless preferences and outcomes are homogeneous in the population, which is very unlikely. The homogeneous cost effectiveness (CE) thresholds used to determine coverage or market entry, and the homogeneity of preferences assumed in CEA, are problematic for the efficient allocation of health care resources. Indeed, Garber and Phelps (1997) studied the economic foundations of CEA and concluded that it can identify egalitarian allocations, but applying a homogeneous rule to a heterogeneous population is not likely to yield a Pareto optimal allocation. Although the political equilibrium might generate a social marginal valuation that places uniform value on outcomes, we show that the resulting one-size-fits-all policy could be detrimental for some segments of the population based on their heterogeneous private value for new technology.====In this paper we examine whether pharmaceutical innovation has delivered enough value to different groups of patients in the U.S. to justify high prices. We focus on the market for colorectal cancer treatments, a setting that has seen both substantial innovation as well as considerable price increases over the past several decades. We first rely on the discrete choice literature to estimate a model of oncologists’ demand for colorectal cancer treatments (Berry, 1994, Berry, Levinsohn, Pakes, 1995, Berry, Pakes, 2007, McFadden, 1974, Nevo, 2000). We next compute the consumer surplus for different patient subpopulations resulting from new regimens entering the market. Finally, we construct a series of quality-adjusted price indices for each group by computing the change in drug prices consistent with the calculated welfare effect. This allows us to assess whether, for these patient subpopulations, quality-adjusted prices rose or fell once new goods entered the market.====The market for colorectal cancer treatments provides an ideal setting for estimating quality-adjusted price indices. From a policy perspective, the innovation-driven changes in drug attributes and prices of cancer treatments has led to considerably different approaches across countries regarding whether and how to regulate access to medical care. As an example, comparing the market shares of colorectal cancer regimens between the U.S. and Europe in 2005, it is clear that regimens with higher expected survival rates (measured in months within each segment, with more effective regimens appearing at the top of the figure) had a larger market share in the U.S. versus Europe, as shown in Figure 1. These differences may lead to significant differences in health outcomes. Indeed, Stevens et al. (2015) show that cancer mortality reductions have been larger in the countries that spend more on treatment. Considering its high prevalence in every country, cancer is therefore an area where the lack of a consensus between governments and their citizens regarding the value of new technology and how to measure that value could have a substantial impact on welfare.====In addition, the colorectal cancer market is attractive for purposes of estimation. It is a setting where physicians are sensitive to price. Because colorectal cancer treatments are usually administered in a physician’s office, physicians take ownership of the drugs they infuse to their patients, are aware of prices, incur substantial carrying costs, and are subject to oversight from health insurers. As a result, physicians consider both clinical and financial considerations when choosing drug treatments for their patients, which leads to fewer instances of supplier-induced demand. This contrasts with most health care markets where physicians are aware of attributes but insulated from price, or where patients face only part of the price.====A key contribution of our paper is to account for physician and patient heterogeneity when estimating demand for drugs. Our model posits that physicians act as agents for their patients, but permits them to have idiosyncratic preferences for drug attributes. We specify a model where, in choosing a therapy for a patient, physicians take into account a patient’s value for each efficacy measure (e.g., median life expectancy when the drug was tested in a randomized controlled trial), their tolerance for side effects, and the extent to which patients are willing to accept greater toxicity to achieve greater efficacy.==== We also allow physicians’ utility to depend on the regimen price. As mentioned above, physicians in this setting incur substantial carrying costs and, therefore, should have aligned incentives with their patients. However, one possible concern is that physicians could potentially profit from more expensive drugs after being reimbursed by the patient’s insurer.==== To address this concern, in our preferred approach we specify a highly flexible model that allows physician preferences for price and non-price attributes to vary with their patients’ characteristics. In addition, our model allows for unobserved heterogeneity in preferences for price across physicians through the inclusion of random coefficients.====We estimate our model using detailed and novel microdata on oncologists’ prescription drug choices from IntrinsiQ, which we combine with drug regimen pricing and market share data from IMS Health and the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) datasets. We also obtain regimen efficacy and side effects measures directly from FDA-approved package inserts that describe the results of phase 3 clinical trials conducted for each drug. These data afford us several advantages. First, our pricing measure reflects the actual transaction price between customers and wholesalers, thereby allowing us to directly observe the costs physicians incur for each regimen. Second, our clinical trial data and market share data allow us to estimate physician treatment responses to various non-price characteristics of each regimen. Finally, our micro data allow us to follow oncologists’ treatment decisions for individual patients over time, as new regimens enter the market and as the characteristics of their patient panels change. In effect, this allows us to separate the extent to which physician prescribing behavior is driven by changes in patient characteristics versus physicians’ idiosyncratic preferences for specific drug attributes, such as price.====In our demand model, we identify physican’s price sensitivity by relying on “Hausman-style” instruments (Nevo, 2000, Nevo, 2001). Specifically, our instruments for a particular regimen in a particular time period are the average prices of all other regimens in prior time periods. The primary identifying assumption is that these average lagged prices are correlated with the price of a regimen in a particular period, but not with any period-specific shocks to regimen demand. Such instruments originally come from the observation that cost information is rarely observed, and more so at the product level. Therefore, prices in other markets could be good candidates for instruments given their correlation with marginal cost.==== We provide the details of our instrumental variables in section 4.2.====Our approach allows us to address two important challenges that are relevant in markets with substantial innovation. The first challenge relates to correctly measuring the cost of living, which has been a concern since the introduction of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) more than 100 years ago. The CPI Commission (Boskin et al., 1998), appointed in 1995, concluded that most of cost of living mismeasurement comes from the introduction of new goods and changes in the quality of goods. Our model explicitly incorporates such changes in quality through our measure of consumer surplus. Alternative and simpler price aggregators such as Laysperes and Paasche, are known to have limitations in terms of how they handle new goods, the substitution patterns they impose, and their resulting biases in estimating the true cost of living index. The Laspeyres index, for instance, measures the change in the cost of a fixed basket of goods from a base period, and therefore, assumes no substitution due to relative price changes, which usually overstates the true cost of living. The opposite is true for the Paasche index, which weighs by current consumption patterns. Our model allows us to obtain the substitution patterns directly from demand estimation.==== The second challenge is to account for the heterogeneity of patients’ willingness to pay due to different price sensitivity and clinical outcomes from treatment. Our approach derives values directly from the demand function, and therefore the heterogeneity in willingness to pay is built naturally into the price index.====We generate several indices for purposes of comparison for the period between 1993 and 2005. During this period, all new products remained on patent, which provides the most conservative scenario for a price index because we do not include decreases in prices due to eventual generic or biosimilar competition.==== First, we construct a “naive” price index that simply reports the mean price of cancer regimens in each quarter, relative to our initial period (1993), without any adjustments for changes in regimen attributes but allowing the market shares (or bundle weights) to change. The naive index is based on the prices physicians pay to acquire each regimen and the market share of each regimen. This index shows a large increase in prices of about 29,000% (see Figure 6), which emphasizes the importance of quality-adjusting in a market with innovation and quality improvement.====We next construct several price indices from the discrete choice demand estimation methods described above. These methods vary in how much preference heterogeneity is allowed, starting from a simple case in which all heterogeneity is accounted for by the idiosyncratic logit error term (McFadden, 1974), and extending to a random coefficients model whose distribution depends on observed patient and unobserved physician characteristics (Berry, Levinsohn, Pakes, 2004, Berry, Levinsohn, Pakes, 1995). In models with idiosyncratic tastes for products, the addition of new products mechanically increases consumer surplus as the error term generates positive demand, and therefore every new product increases consumer surplus. For this reason, we also estimate a pure characteristics model of demand in order to test whether the price index changes when removing the idiosyncratic error term that is present in the logit and random-coefficients models (Berry and Pakes, 2007). The latter model includes only idiosyncratic tastes for characteristics and, to the best of our knowledge, has only been applied empirically in a few studies of computer markets (Nosko, 2014, Song, 2007, Song, 2008). Following Nevo (2003)’s insight, we are explicit regarding our assumptions about the evolution of the outside option and the unobserved components of utility, and we report price indices for each case.====Our results show that accounting for patient heterogeneity matters, with the price index differing for distinct patient types. Our principal finding is that innovation in colorectal cancer treatments appear to have largely benefited patients with late-stage cancers undergoing multiple rounds of treatment, as compared to patients with early-stage cancers. Indeed, we find that patients with advanced cancers undergoing multiple treatment rounds experience a quality-adjusted price decrease of 44 percent, whereas patients with early-stage cancer receiving their first drug treatment experience an increase of 128 percent. In the first case, the value that patients obtain from the more expensive treatment greatly offsets its price, whereas the situation is reversed for patients with less advanced cancer. If one disregards heterogeneity and only uses an average value, such as with CEA, the price index increases by between five and 15 percent, and one would conclude that the innovation we observed in this period was not worth it. If a uniform rule prevented patients with advanced cancer from receiving their preferred treatment, these patients would have experienced large welfare losses. Our results are consistent with the conclusions reached by Lakdawalla et al. (2012), who found that patients at the end of life place large value on hope, and are willing to pay more for therapies that offer the possibility of a longer survival period. Our results are also consistent with survey data suggesting that people substantially value health investments for sick patients (Nord et al., 1995). Similarly, Bauer et al. (2021) develop a theoretical framework for valuing health improvements and find that the willingness to pay for medical treatment by a sick individual is several times greater than what a healthy person would be willing to pay for preventive care that improves longevity by the same amount. Ignoring heterogeneity in value assessment will lead to one-size-fits-all decisions by payers that are disconnected from the preferences of the physician-patient dyads.====The heterogeneity in values we find, and the implied divergent evolution of the price index for different types of patients, is also informative for the efficient design of health insurance. A homogeneous rule based on thresholds determined by CEA would provide coverage for treatments below the CE threshold, and no coverage for treatments above it. Optimal health insurance should allow for the differences in value to express themselves in the market, by either offering a variety of plans that accommodate this heterogeneity in preferences with varying premia (Pauly, 2017), or by allowing patients to internalize treatment costs at the margin through the use of “top-up” insurance, where patients pay the incremental cost relative to a fully covered baseline treatment (Einav et al., 2016). Based on our results, a one-size-fits-all decision rule based on CEA or homogeneous criteria will not lead to optimal decisions for the adoption of technology to treat colorectal cancer.====In the next section we provide the institutional background that underlies our modeling assumptions; in section 3 we describe our data; Section 4 describes our model for estimating the demand system under various assumptions and the computation of the price indices; Section 5 presents our results on demand estimation and the evolution of the price indices; and in section 6we conclude.",Price Indices and the Value of Innovation with Heterogenous Patients,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629622000443,11 May 2022,2022,Research Article,69.0

Specifically, we evaluate the effects of The Ultimate Fighter, a hit TV show that features fighters competing in violent mixed martial arts and which brought Ultimate Fighting Championship into the mainstream. We estimate the effect of exposure to the show’s earliest episodes using panel data from police agencies across the United States and a strategy that uses network ratings prior to the show’s premier as an ====. We show that this exposure significantly reduced crime: these effects are particularly evident for assault, began in the month the show premiered, and persisted for many years. These estimates do not reflect systematic differences across geographic areas in their trends in crime rates prior to 2005. To complement our main results, we also investigate the effects of “UFC Main Events,” which air in bars and on Pay-Per-View. This analysis additionally suggests reductions in violence caused by viewership.","There is a long history of social-science research on the effects of violent media content on anti-social behavior. Laboratory experiments conducted by psychologists, which account for a large share of the rigorous work on this topic, have demonstrated that violent media content increases measures of aggression in the short run.==== This supports the notion that media violence contributes to social problems, which is often cited as the consensus among professionals.==== That said, this type of laboratory-based evidence is unable to account for the fact that, in their every day lives, individuals make choices about the media they consume and their behavior is affected by numerous other personal and contextual factors.====The fact that individuals typically choose what media they consume is a challenge for researchers who seek to estimate the causal effects of media violence. Reverse causality is a major threat to estimates of the relationship between violent-media consumption and violent behavior, whether they are based on cross-sectional, time-series, or panel data. For this reason, obtaining credible estimates of the ==== effect of media violence requires an external force that alters the media that individuals consume—a force that is otherwise unrelated to violence. The power of laboratory studies is that the experimenter can play this role. That said, laboratory studies have three key disadvantages: (i) they study the effects of media content that individuals may choose not to consume in their every day life, (ii) they do not observe individuals in their natural setting, and (iii) they typically evaluate subjects only over a very short period of time. The pioneering study of Dahl and DellaVigna (2009) overcomes these challenges by using field data and exploiting variation in the consumption of violent media across the United States and over time that is driven by blockbuster movie releases. This earlier work finds no evidence that a violent blockbuster movie increases crime following its release.==== In similar spirit, Markey et al. (2015) and Cunningham et al. (2016) examine crime rates around the release of violent video games, finding no evidence that they increase crime in the short run.====Despite the important contributions of these earlier studies, there are many unanswered questions about the effects of media violence on anti-social behavior. Perhaps most important among them is how little we know about the longer-run effects.==== This is made more critical as researchers often highlight “incapacitation effects” as a likely channel through which violent media content might reduce violent behavior. Put simply, media consumption reduces violent behavior because it involves the substitution of time towards an activity during which the probability of violent behavior is low (e.g., watching a program) from activities during which probabilities are higher. We therefore pursue our question with an interest in considering the effects of repeated exposure to violent content over a sustained period of time. For example, one could easily imagine a scenario in which consuming violent media initially reduces crime due to incapacitation, but increases crime in the longer run due to the potential psychological effects that are themselves persistent, or which accumulate through repeated exposure.====We take a step towards doing so by considering the effects of early exposure The Ultimate Fighter (TUF), a hit reality-TV show that features fighters training for and competing in violent mixed martial arts bouts. This show marked the first time that such fights were shown on cable TV and has been credited with bringing Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) into the mainstream. In a spirit similar to Kearney and Levine (2015)’s study of the effects of the show 16 and Pregnant on teen childbearing, we exploit variation in TUF viewership generated by viewership patterns prior to TUF’s premier. In particular, we use Spike TV ratings from the Monday time slot in which TUF would later air (which is based on content that is quite different from TUF) as an instrumental variable for a county’s exposure to TUF. Following Kahn-Lang and Lang (2019), we also control for Spike TV ratings across all days and time slots prior to TUF’s premier to address the possibility that differences in Spike TV viewership may correlate with crime trends or levels. We argue that the variation induced by this instrument, combined with this control variable in particular, offers an intuitively appealing research design that leverages idiosyncratic variation in viewership. We also provide empirical evidence to support this idea.====Our results indicate that early exposure to UFC content via the first season of TUF significantly reduced anti-social behavior, as measured by monthly reports of crimes filed by police agencies across the United States. Interestingly, the effects are particularly evident for assaults, which is the crime that is most closely related to the content of the show itself, though we find qualitatively similar effects on rape and on property crimes. Moreover, these effects began in the month the show premiered and persisted for many years afterwards. In support of our causal interpretation of these estimates, we show that the variation we exploit is unrelated to pre-existing crime trends and levels. We also find estimates very close to zero in “placebo tests” for effects prior to TUF’s premier. Further, using hourly crime data from police agencies across the United States, we provide evidence that similar content depresses violent crime in an analysis of “UFC Main Events,” which air in bars and on Pay-Per-View.====While we have no way of determining exactly which mechanisms explain our main results, our analysis of “UFC Main Events” is helpful towards this end in the sense that it demonstrates reductions in violent crime during the time when individuals were consuming UFC-related content. Naturally, our main results may be driven in part by reductions in crime when individuals were watching new episodes of TUF. However, we would emphasize that the explosion of UFC’s popularity caused by TUF leads us to believe that our estimates likely capture much broader impacts on time-use. In particular, we think of TUF viewership as something that led to more-general interest in UFC-related content among its viewers and their peers. As such, the effects of TUF we document may be explained by direct effects and/or peer effects on time-use outside of the time when new episodes of TUF aired (e.g., watching re-runs on Friday nights and weekends, watching UFC content available from video rental stores, watching UFC Main Events on Saturday nights, or learning/practicing martial arts).==== Separately or in conjunction with any such time-use effects, our results may also be explained by changes in the underlying psychological characteristics that affect an individual’s propensities to engage in violence (or crime) in a given activity. For example, there could be “catharsis” or “relief” effects whereby viewing UFC content (or engaging in related activities) leads to temporary reductions in propensities to engage in anti-social behavior (for individuals with preferences for such behavior).==== It is also possible that preferences could be altered by the UFC’s glorification of violence by its realistic portrayal of serious injuries that can result from physical altercations.====In addition to contributing to the literature on the determinants of anti-social behavior, our study also contributes to the growing literature on the real-world impacts of television-media content. In one of the first rigorous studies in this literature, Gentzkow (2006) shows that the introduction of television accounts for up to half of the decline in American voter turnout since the 1950s. More-recent studies have found that some types of television exposure improve children’s outcomes (Gentzkow, Shapiro, 2008, Cornelson, Kearney and Levine, 2019) whereas other types of television impair children’s outcomes (Herns et al., 2017), that television access affects voters’ preferences (Ellingsen, Herns, 2018, Enikolopov, Petrova, Zhuravskaya, 2011), and that specific types of media content can have significant impacts on birth rates (Kearney, Levine, 2015, La Ferrara, Chong, Duryea, 2012, Trudeau, 2016).==== To our knowledge, our study is the first to document the causal impacts of television content on crime.",Effects of violent media content: Evidence from the rise of the UFC,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016762962200042X,22 April 2022,2022,Research Article,70.0

Disabilities and health shocks can make working difficult and result in large medical expenses which can impact the family budget. People who experience these type of conditions may also require additional help with daily activities. Thus, family members of individuals undergoing health events face a tradeoff between time spent earning income for the family and providing care for their sick family member. Further complicating this decision is health insurance, which may be necessary to help ease medical financial burdens but may also be dependent on employment. Supports that provide transitional assistance to families at the time of onset, such as paid family leave, have the potential to influence decisions about whether to remain with an employer in both the short and long run. In this study, we explore the impact of paid leave mandates on labor supply and caregiving decisions following the onset of a spousal disability or a health shock.====There are costs and benefits to providing informal care after a health shock or the onset of a spouse's disability. Survey data has shown that older adults in the United States tend to express a preference for being cared for at home (Eckert et al., 2004; Wolff et al., 2008), and there are significant cost savings from not using formal or long-term care (Van Houtven and Norton, 2004, 2008). However, the opportunity cost of providing informal care can be substantial as well: for example, the estimated opportunity cost of providing informal care after a cancer diagnosis ranges from $14,000 to $72,000 in the first two years after the diagnosis (Van Houtven et al., 2010, Yabroff and Kim, 2009). Furthermore, there is a long-term negative impact on the labor force participation of caregivers which persists for years into the future (Maestas et al., 2020; Fahle and McGarry, 2017; Van Houtven et al., 2013; Skira, 2015). Evidence from the U.S. using the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) for older adults (Coile, 2004; Lee, 2019) and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) for working-age adults (Meyer and Mok, 2019) finds that labor supply tends to decline following a spousal health shock or disability, although Fadlon and Nielsen (2017) find that individuals in Denmark tend not to change their labor supply in response to a spousal health shock. Although caregiving needs are growing because of the aging population, changing family structures (e.g. fewer children, children living farther apart from parents, and lower likelihood of a household member not in the workforce) means that the decision to provide spousal caregiving is likely to be increasingly important, and policies that recognize the complex nature of caregiving needs may be necessary (Schulz & Eden, 2016).====Federal policy allows some caregivers in the United States to take temporary leave from work. In the event of a disability onset or health shock of a spouse (among other qualifying events), the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993 entitles certain employees at firms with more than 50 employees to job-protected leave that continues any group health insurance, but this leave is unpaid. Job protection is an important benefit, but not all families may be able to take advantage of such leave, possibly explaining estimates of small effects of FMLA (Waldfogel, 1999; Baum, 2006). Taking unpaid leave from work is costly in that family resources are unambiguously reduced, even if one is guaranteed the opportunity to return following the time away from work; paid family leave reduces this cost by providing partial pay for time spent caring for a spouse that might otherwise be unpaid. Having paid leave in addition to job-protected leave may reduce the conflicting incentives an employee faces between providing additional care for their spouse themselves and continuing to maintain a steady income stream.====Although the COVID-19 pandemic brought the issue of paid leave to the forefront, with the Families First Coronavirus Response Act temporarily requiring employers to provide paid leave to workers who are affected by COVID-19, employers are largely not required to accommodate worker family caregiving needs with paid leave. A few states have created state paid family leave programs for employees who experience qualifying family or health events that provide partially or fully compensated time away from work to provide caregiving to family members. Eight states currently mandate paid family leave (California, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Washington, and Washington D.C.) with a few more state policies taking effect in the near future (Oregon in 2023 and Colorado in 2024) and many additional states considering adopting their own policies (Brainerd, 2017). At the national level, the American Families Plan proposed by President Biden in April 2021 would permanently guarantee all workers in the U.S. twelve weeks of paid family leave.====In this paper, we study how paid leave laws influence caregiving and labor supply decisions after a spousal disability or health shock. We begin by evaluating the likelihood of labor force exit, reduction in weeks worked, earnings, and caregiving provision following a spouse's onset of a disability or health shock in the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) for both the potential caregiver and the spouse. We then examine the effect of paid leave mandates in California and New Jersey on the potential caregivers overall and separately for various demographic subgroups. Our results show that the onset of a work-limiting chronic health condition, disability or illness of a spouse reduces the labor force attachment of the spouse and potential caregiver, which is consistent with earlier research in the U.S. We find evidence that paid leave mandates reduce the likelihood that potential caregivers report decreasing their work hours due to providing care; however, we also find that paid leave mandates resulted in potential caregivers being more likely to not work due to providing care and work fewer weeks if they are unlikely to have access to job protection through FMLA. We did not find evidence of an impact on other outcomes, for which we discuss several potential explanations.====Our main contribution is to the literature on paid leave. Labor supply decisions are not the only ways that paid leave might impact well-being or total welfare; however, paid leave policies are generally intended to promote greater labor force attachment, making work decisions an important policy outcome. Given the limited protection from current paid leave policies and other programs that are already in place, and the recent interest in expanding paid leave policies, understanding how paid leave policies affect work decisions is an important empirical question. Almost all recent work on paid leave has focused on the effect on women's careers after childbirth, given the importance of maternity leave on the early career paths of women. Paid leave laws are more common in OECD countries than in the U.S., and research focused on those countries has found that paid leave of up to one year results in an increase in women's employment following childbirth (Ruhm, 1998; Lalive & Zweimüller, 2009). In the U.S., recent work has analyzed the impact of California's 2004 Paid Leave Act and found that women's employment and wages improved in the short run (Rossin-Slater, Ruhm, and Waldfogel, 2013; Baum and Ruhm, 2016; Byker, 2016), but possibly has little impact on the longer-term (Bailey et al., 2019). There is no evidence that increasing the paid leave benefit amount increases leave duration or leads to adverse labor market outcomes for women after childbirth (Rossin-Slater and Uniat, 2019). Despite the large literature on the impact of paid leave on women's labor supply decisions after childbirth, there has been limited research on the impact of paid leave on potential caregivers for spouses experiencing a disability or health shock. Saad-Lessler (2020) estimates the impact of paid leave on the labor force participation of informal caregivers in California, but does not examine the impact on labor force participation that results from the initial decision to provide informal caregiving after the health shock. Our research further explores this question.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We first provide background information on paid leave laws and the specific laws we use for identification in our estimation. We then discuss the conceptual framework we use to formulate hypotheses. We next describe the data we use in the study followed by the empirical methods.

The new policy, referred to as ‘income management’, restricted the way Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander benefit recipients in the Northern Territory==== could spend their entitlements. Most benefit recipients in Australia receive a cash transfer. Under income management, people living in Aboriginal communities who received government benefits – including unemployment, disability support, parenting payments and the pension – had half of those payments quarantined into a separate account, which was designated to be spent on priority needs and could not be withdrawn as cash. The policy's official objective was to improve the welfare of Aboriginal children living in remote communities. Gaps in social, economic and physical health between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people in Australia have persisted over decades, a phenomenon that many rich nations with Indigenous populations are struggling with (Mitrou et al., 2014; Cooke et al., 2007).====This policy was introduced with the goal of addressing what officials saw as the behavioral causes of persistent disadvantage in Aboriginal communities.==== The Australian Prime Minister at the time emphasized “the parental responsibility that accompanies [parents’] right to welfare support” (Howard, 2007, 73), reflecting the policy's aim to reduce entrenched disadvantage by changing individual behavior. However, whether the policy change was successful in improving outcomes for children has not been rigorously tested.====In this paper, we are the first to evaluate the effectiveness of the initial rollout of income management on children's health outcomes. Specifically, we study birthweight, a particularly useful outcome when considering the effects of a policy that targeted budget priorities. Birthweight is the most accessible marker of newborns’ health, making it an ideal outcome for comparing our findings with the international literature. It is also predictive of children's survival in the first year of life (Wilcox, 2001), a key health policy target for the Northern Territory's Aboriginal communities, where twice as many children are born with low birthweight than the Territory's average. Although birthweight markers have their limitations, they are suitable to pick up environmental and nutritional shocks that affect the mother during pregnancy (Almond et al., 2005). Birthweight variations at the lower end of the distribution also tell a good story about the likely long-term consequences. Low birthweight is associated in a meaningful way with adult health (Risnes et al., 2011), schooling attainment (Bharadwaj et al., 2018), and later-life income (Currie and Moretti, 2007; Bharadwaj et al., 2018).====Income management affected all benefit recipients within the targeted communities.==== The communities that were targeted by the initial rollout of income management are not only remote, but exceptionally poor in economic terms. Most experience high levels of food insecurity, and nutrition is mainly based on energy-dense and nutrient-poor foods (Brimblecombe et al., 2010). Over half of the population experiences cash poverty (Markham and Biddle, 2018). For most Aboriginal women living in such remote areas, government transfers are their main source of income (Venn et al., 2020).====We analyze the impact of in utero exposure to income management. In the same way as Almond et al. (2011), we define a baby as ‘treated’ by income management if the policy was introduced in their community before the beginning of the third trimester of pregnancy: that means that we include babies for whom the policy was introduced before conception, or in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy as ‘treated’. The comparison group is babies who are born before income management came into their community – and therefore the policy could not have affected their birthweight – or for whom it came in at the very end of pregnancy, meaning a very short period of in utero exposure. Our event study estimates break down the effects of these different periods of exposure.====Our hypothesis is that if income management increased consumption of essentials, this would be reflected in improved nutrition of pregnant women, and therefore in increased birthweight – patterns that have been found, for example, in the US with the introduction of food stamps (Almond et al., 2011). Conversely, if the spending restriction was not binding because households already spent more than half of their income on essentials, we would expect no change in consumption patterns or in birthweight. Data on households’ spending and consumption at the time are not available. However, earlier survey data for the region suggest that most low-income households were already spending over half of their income on essentials. If this is also true for the targeted communities, we may expect the policy to have no discernible impact on birthweight.====Our analysis draws on administrative records on the universe of all births to women living in affected communities, from the Northern Territory Data Linkage Study (Silburn et al., 2018). To identify the impact of the policy, we exploit its gradual rollout that occurred over 13 months with 32 different implementation dates across clusters of communities. We apply a standard generalized difference-in-difference model, as well as a newly developed estimator which addresses potential biases because of multiple rollout dates (Borusyak et al., 2021). To deal with potential violations in the common trend assumption, we use methods suggested by Roth and Freyaldenhoven et al. (2019).====We demonstrate that the rollout schedule of the policy was as good as random. The policy was implemented shortly after its announcement, was compulsory, and allowed almost no exemptions. This means there was no capacity to self-select into whether or when to receive the intervention. Importantly, the rollout was not linked to pre-existing variations in birthweight or community characteristics. Contrary to expectations, we find that the policy introduction reduced average birthweights of children who were exposed to income management in utero by 85 g. The adverse effects are present throughout the birthweight distribution and are larger at the lower end. Not surprisingly, the policy increased the risk of low birthweight by 3 percentage points. The policy was most detrimental the earlier the in-utero exposure.====These findings raise the question of what elements of the income management policy may have caused harm to babies in utero. One hypothesis is that the income management policy itself changed behavior in unintended ways. Another hypothesis is that the policy was not correctly implemented, causing disruption of benefit payments. To disentangle these mechanisms, we evaluate a range of explanations. We show that the negative treatment effect cannot be explained by recipients’ behavioral changes in response to the policy, such as changes in fertility, maternal risky health behaviors, or access to perinatal care. There is also no evidence that income management improved chances of survival for at-risk fetuses, which may reduce average birthweight, but would nevertheless be a beneficial outcome.====This leaves us with a more qualitative assessment of why income management reduced birthweight. We find that during the implementation period, recipients who did not immediately comply with new rules for accessing their funds had their payments suspended – this affected up to one-third of all recipients. Furthermore, those who could access their funds had their spending restricted in ways that were not intended by the policy. The most acute of these issues were resolved within the first year of the policy's operation, but during the rollout period, it led to substantial income insecurity. Qualitative evidence from an early Government report supports this conclusion. Because of the lack of consultation with Aboriginal communities, recipients were confused about how to access existing benefits, and in some cases, this led to short-run food insecurity (Yu et al., 2008). Cobb-Clark et al. (2021), who evaluated the policy's impact on children's school attendance, suggested that the policy led to family discord and a temporary disruption to school attendance.====Much of the discussion around income management has focused on whether or not it ‘works’, with many commentators questioning the underlying assumption that households receiving government transfers were spending more than half of their income on alcohol, tobacco and gambling (Altman, 2016; Klein, 2016; Bielefeld, 2018). While this is an important question, our findings show that it is not the only determinant of the policy's impact, at least in the short-term. Even if the policy's theory of change was sound, its ability to meet its goals was hampered by the way it was implemented. In itself, any significant change to a long-standing program may cause disruption when it is first introduced, as recipients must adjust to a new way of accessing and managing their money. This disruption was compounded by the fact that much of the financial and logistical infrastructure required to administer the program did not exist when the policy rollout began. Furthermore, the top-down and racially-targeted imposition of the policy has made many recipients less receptive to it (Yu et al., 2008; Dalley, 2020).====Many countries use paternalistic approaches to welfare policy (Currie and Gahvari, 2008). Australia's experience with income management demonstrates that the way that such policies are implemented – as distinct from the details of the policies themselves – can drive impact, leading to unintended consequences. Indeed, implementation issues are particularly likely with paternalistic policies, because they are more complex and costly to administer (Margolies and Hoddinott, 2015), creating more opportunity for the policy ‘as implemented’ to deviate from the policy ‘as designed’.====Our findings therefore contribute to an international literature that attributes the quality of implementation of a policy as the defining factor in whether it achieves its intended goal (Durlak and DuPre, 2008; Cerna, 2013). Examples in the literature are abound. For instance, the Learnfare initiative that linked families' welfare payments to the school attendance of their teenage children, failed in part due to challenges administering it (Ethridge and Percy, 1993). Program outcomes can vary with how financial incentives (or sanctions) are structured (Dee, 2011), the coherence of the underlying statutes (Meier and McFarlane, 1995), and the way that parents are engaged with a program (Gennetian et al., 2016).====Independent of the reasons for which the income management policy harmed exposed babies in utero, our findings suggest that at least one birth cohort of babies were born with lower birthweights and higher risks of long-term health and developmental problems. Our findings on a poorly implemented policy therefore also contribute to a body of research which is concerned with the adverse effects of in utero exposure to inadequate income, risky health behaviors, stress and environmental pollution (see Aizer and Currie, 2014). Although previous studies have shown that restricted-use transfers can prevent or reduce the health effects of early-life shocks (Currie and Rossin-Slater, 2015), we demonstrate the potential for changes in transfer policies – particularly when they are implemented with a very short transition period – to have unintended consequences on early-life health outcomes. While we are unable to say whether these effects persisted for future birth cohorts, it is likely that there were long-term impacts on human capital for the cohort of children who born during or shortly after the policy introduction. It is well understood that poor early-life health outcomes can have long-term consequences (Almond et al., 2018). Our findings are of critical significance to policymakers because they demonstrate that policies that are not carefully designed, implemented and tested may unintentionally escalate the inequities they seek to address.",Unintended consequences of welfare reform: Evidence from birthweight of Aboriginal children in Australia,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629622000388,7 April 2022,2022,Research Article,72.0

The economics literature often points to low responsiveness to quality as a source of inefficiency, and policymakers have made substantial investments in a variety of public quality measures to attempt to improve market allocations.==== However, healthcare markets are unusual in that consumers often do not face the full prices of the goods or services they acquire, and this has important implications for demand estimation. Other rationing mechanisms such as waiting times often serve as the equilibrating factor, but these can be difficult to observe.====Because of these institutional features and data limitations, many studies of the effect of quality on demand do not include a market-clearing price, or some other equilibrating factor such as a waiting time. But without this, as we show, estimates of the effect of quality on demand may be biased toward zero and demand forecasts may similarly be attenuated. The intuition is simple: if more patients want to see providers of higher quality, but the providers have limits on the number of patients they can treat—e.g., some form of capacity constraints—then higher quality providers may be harder to see. Hence there may be a ==== among patients, which does not appear in standard discrete-choice models of provider demand. A market-clearing price or waiting time would capture this effect, but the price may not exist and good data on waiting times are often not available. Absent an equilibrating factor such as these in the demand model, the congestion effect could generate a downward bias in the estimate of the effect of a quality measure on demand (or the effect any desirable characteristic, for that matter). Consequently, the value of investments in provider quality may be greater than indicated by some existing results, because the market response to quality improvements may be greater than what the standard models would predict.====Our goal in this paper is to understand and address this problem. In theory, this bias could be present any time the supply from individual providers is not perfectly elastic, because the negative spillover from the congestion effect would be larger for higher quality providers, who tend to have greater demand. This issue seems most relevant for individual physicians, because it is natural to expect that the supply from individual professionals would not be perfectly elastic, due to fixed capacity or time constraints, or any other reasons for increasing marginal costs. Hence this issue would be particularly relevant for studies about the effect of quality on demand for individual specialists, such as in the literature on the effects of public “report cards” for heart surgeons. On the other hand, the congestion effect may be less important for health insurance plans and large institutional providers like hospitals.====To address the bias, we propose a relatively simple and tractable way to incorporate a congestion effect among consumers into discrete-choice models of provider choice, and thereby to obtain more accurate estimates of the effects of changes in provider quality on equilibrium outcomes. The approach is to include a proxy measure for congestion as an explanatory variable in the model. Our main proposal is to use the number of patients treated by each provider as the proxy, because this requires no additional data beyond what is needed to estimate a standard model. In a similar spirit as Ackerberg and Rysman (2005), we develop a stylized equilibrium model that would yield this specification: a queuing model where waiting times are linear in the number of patients. However this assumes that capacity is uniform across providers, so the proxy could be weak. With additional data, for example on time allocated to administrative duties or academic research, it could be possible to adjust for differences in the capacity of individual specialists. We do not have such data, but we do construct and evaluate a more complex measure of congestion, which adjusts for the typical number of days per month that a specialist (e.g., cardiac surgeon) is observed to provide any services in a hospital. However we find that in our application this measure performs worse than the unadjusted number of patients, perhaps because the observed days per month in a hospital do not accurately measure the surgeon's truly available days.====The number of patients treated by a provider is naturally endogenous, so it cannot be used directly. Instead we apply an instrumental variables method to estimate the model, which is adapted from work on equilibrium location choices by Bayer and Timmins (2007). The method is similar to the demand estimation in Berry et al. (1995), but it replaces the price of each alternative with a peer effect that reflects various possible spillovers (positive or negative) among households or firms at the same location. In our case, this spillover is the negative congestion effect among patients seeking services from the same physician.====As with prices in the usual Berry et al. (1995) framework, the number of patients treated by a physician is endogenous and requires an instrument. In models of physician choice, the distances between patients and providers in a market offer a natural instrument. While the distance between a patient and a given provider directly affects the propensity to see that provider, the distances between ==== patients and that provider only affect the propensity through that provider's patient volume. We examine the performance of this instrument in our empirical application, and we informally assess its exogeneity. Additionally, we show that the two-step estimation procedure can be implemented using standard commands in econometric software such as Stata, making this approach readily available for applied research.====Because the patient volume is only an approximation for a true rationing mechanism, our model cannot be interpreted structurally as representing consumer preferences. Neither, however, can standard models that omit any equilibrating factor (unless supply is perfectly elastic).==== Instead, both types of models should be interpreted as fitting the equilibrium probabilities that patients with certain characteristics receive services from physicians with certain characteristics. Fitting and forecasting these probabilities is nevertheless important, particularly to measure the consumer responsiveness to quality and to predict the effect of quality improvements on market allocations and patient outcomes. Our primary emphasis is thus on the improvement in forecasts of changes in equilibrium quantities (e.g., patient volumes) given changes in quality. As we first show analytically and in a numerical example, without accounting for the congestion effect among patients, forecasts of changes in equilibrium outcomes given changes in the quality or number of physicians in a market are systematically biased—not just the parameter estimates themselves. We then show that the improvements from our approach are empirically relevant in our analysis of the market for heart surgery.====An important question is whether the use of a proxy for congestion could increase rather than decrease bias in the estimated effect of quality on demand. The econometric literature on proxy variables has examined this tradeoff between measurement error and omitted variable bias, and has provided general conditions for when a mismeasured proxy improves estimates compared to the omission of a relevant factor (e.g., McCallum 1972, Wickens 1972, Frost 1979). We discuss these conditions in detail, and our results indicate that the proxy is indeed reducing bias in the estimated effect of quality, by absorbing some of the confounding effects of congestion. Consequently, while our model may be misspecified, it should still outperform a model that entirely omits an equilibrating factor.====Of course, this approach using a proxy is not needed if accurate data on waiting times or other rationing mechanisms are available, as in the rich literature on waiting times discussed in Section 1.2. However typical sources (e.g., claims or discharge records) do not show a patient's prospective waiting times at every provider in the market.==== Also, this issue could arise in any regime—public or private sector, administered or negotiated prices—where patients have choices among providers.==== Fundamentally, if accurate data are not available on the actual rationing mechanism(s), then estimates of the response to quality may be attenuated.====Below we summarize the empirical application and discuss the related literature on quality effects and rationing mechanisms. Section 2 then develops our approach: it extends a standard discrete-choice model of provider choice to include a congestion effect, briefly presents an equilibrium model that would yield our specification, and finally describes the estimation procedure. Section 3 provides intuition and econometric analyses about the attenuation bias in parameter estimates and forecasts from models without an equilibrating factor, and discusses the issue of measurement error in models with a proxy variable.

Under two-part pricing the health plan pays a fixed fee for access to a drug at unit prices equal to marginal costs. Despite two-part pricing being socially efficient, we show that the health plan is worse off when the drug producer is a monopolist, as all surplus is extracted. This result is reversed with competition, as two-part pricing yields higher ","Pharmaceutical firms need to make large, up-front investments in drug discovery and clinical trials before new drugs can be approved and launched in the market. To stimulate such investments, pharmaceutical firms are granted patent protection, which in many cases gives rise to market power. Although market power is deliberately granted, and intended to allow pharmaceutical firms to charge higher prices over a given period of time, controversies over excessive prices are common. New life-extending drugs for cancer treatment, orphan drugs that target rare but severe diseases, and new HIV drugs are examples of drugs that have come under scrutiny for very high prices.====Inducing innovation by allowing firms to charge high prices for new drugs runs the risk of reducing access to new treatments in spite of relatively low variable costs of production. This illustrates the familiar trade-off between static and dynamic efficiency. Public health plans in different countries try to mitigate supply-side market power by employing various price control mechanisms, such as direct regulation of drug prices (price caps) or regulation of the reimbursement level (reference pricing). To what extent price controls curtail market power, though, depends on the availability of close substitutes and documented treatment effects. Drugs that offer substantial health improvements will often be able to charge higher prices within such regulatory frameworks.====Recently, new drug pricing mechanisms, referred to as the Netflix model applied to pharmaceuticals, have been proposed to decouple the utilisation of a new drug from payments that allow recoupment of the firm’s development costs. Instead of paying a price per package, the health plan negotiates a fixed amount (access or subscription fee) in exchange for unlimited prescription volume. Australia has adopted this approach to providing antivirals (DAAs) to patients with hepatitis C virus. According to Moon and Erickson (2019), the Australian authority negotiated an agreement to spend approximately 1 billion Australian dollars over 5 years to get unlimited access to the drugs. Two states in the US, Louisiana and Washington, have recently adopted similar purchasing strategies for the same class of drugs.====As a two-part tariff, the so-called Netflix model has the intuitive advantages of giving access to the individual customers at very low marginal cost for the health plan without preventing suppliers from profiting from valuable innovations. Translating these effects into pharmaceutical markets, however, requires attention to specific institutional characteristics, including decisions made by health plans and competition between suppliers of drugs that target the same group of patients. In this paper, we compare the performance of two-part tariffs and uniform prices, both from the health plan’s and drug producers’ point of view. We model a market for on-patent prescription drugs that is served either by a monopolist or by two different producers supplying therapeutically substitutable drugs. A drug producer can only gain access to the market if the health plan is willing to sign a contract with this producer, and these contractual decisions determine which drugs can be prescribed by physicians affiliated with the health plan.====Although two-part tariffs have the advantage of lowering marginal prices for usage, they do not ==== prevent firms from extracting surplus from health plans and procurers of pharmaceuticals. To what extent these new pricing schemes will reduce overall drugs costs, fixed fees included, depends on the firms’ market power and the potential for therapeutic competition between two drug producers. When the quality difference between the two drugs is sufficiently large, turning the high-quality supplier into a ==== monopolist, we confirm the well-known property of two-part tariffs: The price charged per prescription equals marginal costs and the fixed fee extracts the entire surplus of the health plan. Although two-part tariffs ensure efficient access to the drug, the health plan prefers uniform pricing if therapeutic competition is out of reach.====Once we introduce therapeutic competition between the two suppliers, there is a striking change in the health plan’s preference ranking of the two payment schemes. The reason for this is two-fold. First, with therapeutic competition, the credible threat of excluding one of the drugs from the health plan protects the plan against the aggressive surplus extraction when the drug producer is a monopolist. Second, two-part tariffs eliminate an allocative inefficiency that is present under monopoly pricing. Although different patented drugs belong to the same therapeutic class, they are not perfect substitutes. Marginal cost pricing associated with two-part tariffs ensures that the individual patients are allocated to the best drug, taking into account both treatment effects and costs. With uniform pricing, the allocation of patients between the two drugs is distorted since the firm with highest quality can exploit its demand advantage by setting a higher price.====The two-part tariff scheme (so-called Netflix model) therefore improves access to high-quality drugs, in line with its advocacy among policymakers. The distribution of surplus, however, crucially depends on the competition regime. Drug suppliers tend to prefer uniform pricing under therapeutic competition, and two-part tariffs under monopoly, which is the exact opposite of the ranking of payment regimes by the health plan. Thus, if we consider a game in which the health plan is given the power to determine the type of payment scheme at the outset, the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium would have two-part tariffs only in the presence of (sufficiently strong) therapeutic competition. This conclusion relies on the assumption that the health plan will include all drugs that contributes to increasing its surplus. However, in an extension to the main analysis we show that if we include the possibility of exclusive contracts, where only one of the drugs is included in the health plan, then uniform pricing is always weakly preferred by the purchaser.====Our study builds on, and bridges, two different strands of literature. On the one side, we employ a standard theoretical framework applied to pharmaceutical markets for studying price competition and regulatory policies under imperfect competition. Due to heterogeneity among patients and differences in quality and the workings of different drugs, models combining horizontal and vertical differentiation have been useful in capturing important features of pharmaceutical markets, both demand-side and supply-side characteristics (see for example Brekke et al. (2007), Miraldo (2009), Bardey et al. (2010), Bardey et al. (2016), Brekke et al. (2016) and González et al. (2016)). Among these, the general set-up in our paper relates most closely to the spatial formulation in Brekke et al. (2007) and Miraldo (2009).====The theoretical framework allows us to analyse two-part tariffs both under monopoly and with imperfect competition between producers of imperfect substitutes. The same therapeutic class will often contain several drugs with different active ingredients. These are not perfect substitutes, but with sufficiently overlapping treatment effects, prices can influence on prescription choices within the therapeutic class. Kanavos et al. (2007) analysed the existence of competition between branded statins in European markets prior to patent expiry. Their results is consistent with potential price sensitivity in the branded market for statins. Danzon and Epstein (2012) found that prices of new drugs are influenced by prices of other products in the same class. Lu and Comanor (1998) analysed therapeutic competition and found that launch prices of drugs that are closer substitutes to existing brands are typically priced at comparable levels. In addition, they found that the number of branded substitutes has a substantial negative effect on launch prices. In our model we allow intensity of therapeutic competition to depend on both drug characteristics and the price sensitivity of physicians’ prescription choices.====The novel contribution of our paper in relation to this strand of literature is two-fold. First, we introduce two-part pricing into this framework, whereas previous studies focus solely on uniform pricing. As we will show, two-part pricing not only changes the drug producers’ pricing decisions (including unit prices), but indeed also the intensity of competition among the producers. Second, we allow for the health plan to decide on market access of one or both of the drugs, implying that drug producers compete both for the market and on the market. Both elements implies a radical change in equilibrium outcomes compared to the standard models.====On the other side, our paper builds on the strand of literature that focuses on two-part tariffs. Since the seminal paper by Oi (1971), two-part pricing contracts are known for allowing a monopolist to sell goods at marginal cost, but to still extract consumer surplus in the form of an up-front payment. There is a large literature on price discrimination, including two-part tariffs, in oligopoly markets, with early contributions going back to Stole (1996), Armstrong and Vickers (2001), and Yin (2004). These models focus on two-part pricing at consumer level and do not deal with the specificities of pharmaceutical markets.==== Lakdawalla and Sood (Lakdawalla, Sood, 2009, Lakdawalla, Sood, 2013) consider two-part pricing in health care markets. Health insurance, both public and private, implies that consumers pay up-front premiums in exchange for lower unit prices (co-payments) in the event of illness. Assuming that insured consumers’ demand for drugs is a function of the co-payments (in addition to their health status and income), they show that health insurance eliminates the deadweight loss from market power in health care provision, including pharmaceuticals. Our paper focuses on a different issue, namely two-part pricing at health plan level instead of consumer level. This topic is conceptually different, and allows us to study the game between drug producers and health plans in terms of market access and inclusion of drugs in the health plan. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first attempt to derive properties of two-part tariffs, when applied by health plans in paying for pharmaceuticals. Our aim is to study the effect on two-part pricing on the health plan’s access decision and the corresponding distribution of surpluses across drug producers and the health plan. This is a highly relevant issue both for public and private health plans.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we present the model. In Section 3 we compare uniform pricing and two-part tariffs in the case where the market is served by a monopolist. Therapeutic competition is then introduced in Section 4, where we make the same comparison of pharmaceutical pricing schemes when the market is (potentially) served by the producers of two therapeutically substitutable drugs. In Section 5 we extend the analysis in three different directions. First, in the case of therapeutic competition we include the possibility of exclusive contracting by the health plan. Second, we check whether our main results are robust to an alternative price determination process, in which drug prices result from Nash bargaining between the health plan and the drug producer(s). Finally, we analyse the implications of alternative payment schemes for drug innovation incentives.

We further provide suggestive evidence that improved maternal health-related knowledge and behaviors during pregnancy are plausible channels through which the reform might have affected fetal health.,"Prenatal care is a central component of public policy since it targets both maternal and child health. Its main goals include improving maternal health knowledge, preventive monitoring of pregnancy, early diagnosis of high-risk pregnancies, maternal infections, and fetal abnormalities, as well as their potential treatment (see, e.g., Alexander and Korenbrot (1995) or Currie and Grogger (2002)). Specific regulations regarding the quality, content, and timing of medical care during pregnancy differ considerably across countries (Bernloehr et al., 2005); however, there seems to be a consensus that prenatal care should begin as early as possible (Alwan et al., 2016). For example, the World Health Organization (2016) recommends its initiation at the latest in the 12==== week of gestation, arguing that the first trimester of pregnancy lays the foundations for a child's future development. However, despite the general increase in the coverage of early prenatal care over recent decades, it is still far from universal. Even in the highest-income countries, on average, only 82% of women initiated prenatal care in the first trimester of pregnancy in 2013 (Moller et al., 2017). In the US, in 2016, the overall rate of first-trimester care was 77%, with a substantial variation across states and socioeconomic groups (Osterman and Martin, 2018). On the other hand, visits during the first trimester have long been endorsed as means to prevent problems that may occur later in the pregnancy and to advise expectant mothers on beneficial behaviors, such as eliminating smoking, alcohol and illegal substance consumption (Bailey and Sokol, 2008), paying attention to healthy nutrition (Godfrey et al., 1996), taking the recommended vitamin supplements (Hovdenak and Haram, 2012), and using additional screening opportunities (Di Giacomo et al., 2022). However, to date, we do not know much about the causal link between the timing of prenatal care and child health and in particular about shifting its initiation to earlier in pregnancy. Little is also known about what programs and policy interventions might effectively incentivize early prenatal care utilization.====Most economists who study the link between prenatal care and birth outcomes draw on the theoretical framework by Grossman (1972), where prenatal care enters the “infant health production function” simultaneously with maternal health endowments, behaviors, and other inputs. Thus, a key empirical challenge is the potential endogeneity of the demand for prenatal care, which is likely correlated with unobserved maternal characteristics and other parental inputs that simultaneously affect infant health. Early empirical research addressed this endogeneity problem and estimated the production functions using a two-stage approach that used a set of individual‐level and local-area instrumental variables, such as goods prices, health infrastructure, public expenditures, and labor market conditions (e.g., Rosenzweig and Schultz, 1983 or Grossman and Joyce, 1990). These studies generally find that prenatal care moderately improves neonatal health. More recent literature has increasingly used quasi-experimental designs that exploit sources of exogenous variation from changes in Medicaid policies (e.g., Joyce 1999; Gray, 2001; Currie and Grogger, 2002) or bus strikes (Evans and Lien, 2005). These studies focus primarily on socioeconomically disadvantaged mothers and the effects of expanded access to prenatal care and its utilization, rather than the timing of its commencement. Evans and Lien (2005) provide suggestive evidence that a loss of a prenatal visit early on in the pregnancy is more detrimental than visits lost later on, but their delineation happens only at the 6==== month of pregnancy. Generally, the literature is silent on the possible gains from shifting prenatal care initiation to much earlier stages in the pregnancy.====Recent literature reviews support these notions and conclude that we still know relatively little about the causal effect of prenatal care on child outcomes, and especially the role of its timing (Almond and Currie, 2011; Currie and Rossin-Slater, 2015; Corman et al., 2019). At the same time, prenatal care should be viewed as one of the earliest investments in a child's development, and growing evidence documents that health status at birth has long-term consequences for socioeconomic outcomes, such as education (Almond and Currie, 2011; Figlio et al., 2014), employment and wages (Black et al., 2007), mortality (Bharadwaj et al., 2017), and other adult outcomes (Almond et al., 2018). The question of whether the timing of prenatal care affects neonatal health becomes particularly important in light of self-productivity of human capital and dynamic complementarities of skills (Cunha and Heckman, 2007).====From a policy perspective, parallel to a discussion about the effects of prenatal care is the question of whether and how governments can encourage mothers to begin care as early as possible. While direct costs might create barriers in access to prenatal care in absence of a universal health care system, empirical evidence suggest that also in settings where pregnant women are eligible for free prenatal care, the utilization is still far from universal. For example, in the US, only two-thirds of women eligible for Medicaid had their first visit in the first trimester in 2016 (Osterman and Martin 2018). Two commonly suggested policy tools that could help to promote early initiation of prenatal care are information and monetary incentives. In the former case, governments or NGOs provide information to the public in the interest of changing a suboptimal behavior. For example, it has been shown that such interventions can be successful in educational (Wiswall and Zafar, 2015) and health (Keskin et al., 2017) decisions. Providing only information or guidance, however, may not be sufficient since its reception and understanding may vary across different educational or socioeconomic groups (de Walque, 2010; Lange, 2011), or it simply may not induce the expected behavioral change (Prina and Royer, 2014).==== Monetary incentives, in turn, have gained popularity in the developing world as an effective policy tool (Lagarde et al., 2007), and more recently, they have started being employed in developed countries (Leininger and Levy, 2015; Fryer, 2017).==== Their main premise is a contract between a principal (government) and an agent (recipient) that payment will be made upon fulfilling a priori specified conditions.====In this paper, we evaluate the effects of a policy implemented in 2009 in Poland, which directly speaks to the questions of whether the timing of prenatal care matters and whether mothers respond to financial incentives. Specifically, the reform required mothers to obtain a medical certificate of having the first prenatal visit by the 10==== week of gestation in order to be entitled to a one-time cash transfer paid after childbirth. Before the reform, no such certification was required, making the benefit unconditional. Given the universal coverage by public health insurance, the reform did not affect the eligibility for, the utilization of, or the access to prenatal care itself. Already before the reform, nearly all mothers used prenatal care services during pregnancy. Thus, for most mothers, the policy change effectively shifted the timing of their first prenatal care visit towards earlier in the pregnancy. Polish parliament passed the legislation on 6==== December 2008 but the law was only effective for births on or after 1==== November 2009. This unique hold-up in policy implementation allows us to separately identify the effects of providing unconditional public information versus a joint effect of monetary incentive and public information about the benefits of early initiation of prenatal care. We also focus on a setting where pregnant women are eligible for free prenatal care, so that there are no substantial direct monetary barriers in the access to health care services.====To estimate the effects of the reform on infant health, we use data on all births and fetal deaths in Poland between 2006 and 2011 paired with a difference-in-differences (DD) identification strategy. In that, we compare mothers whose conceptions happened shortly before and shortly after the policy-relevant cutoffs to mothers who conceived in the same weeks but in nonreform years. Overall, we observe statistically significant positive effects of the reform on neonatal outcomes, such as decreased fetal deaths and increased birth weight. On the other hand, we do not identify economically meaningful effects on gestational age. We show that these results are not driven by potential selection issues and that the estimates are remarkably robust to alternative econometric specifications and sample restrictions. Due to the sequential nature of the legislation, we further document that financial conditionality is essential to generate the observed gains in neonatal health. Although relatively imprecise, our heterogeneity analysis points to somewhat larger effects among children from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds and those at higher risks of adverse birth outcomes. Using auxiliary survey data, we also document post-reform improvements in maternal knowledge and behaviors related to drinking and smoking during pregnancy, which are consistent with the observed gains in neonatal health though not necessarily the exclusive mechanisms behind the positive effects. These behavioral changes are also larger for more disadvantaged mothers, which is in line with heterogenous effects of the reform on neonatal health.====These findings contribute to the existing literature in multiple ways. First, we show that the change in timing of prenatal care, even relatively early in pregnancy, affects infant health. This is different from prior work that focused on access to prenatal care and its utilization per se rather than the timing of its initiation. Thus, our results provide a validation of the prevalent medical recommendations (e.g., by the WHO) by exploiting a universal policy. Second, we document that health improvements from prenatal care can be achieved by introducing conditionality to an already existing unconditional family transfer granted after birth. Moreover, we show that public information stemming from the passage of the reform is itself insufficient to affect birth outcomes, and the conditionality of the cash transfer is a critical piece of the legislation that leads to improvements in neonatal health. To the best of our knowledge, this distinction between public information and conditional cash transfer has not been previously studied in the context of prenatal care and infant health. Documenting these phenomena is particularly important from a policy perspective given the inconclusive findings from other interventions previously studied in the literature (see, Corman et al., 2019).

In this paper, I fill this gap by integrating occupational choice in the health deficit model of Dalgaard and Strulik (2014). The health deficit model is a life cycle model with physiological aging and endogenous longevity derived from basic principles of human biology and gerontology. Health deficits are measured by the frailty index (Mitnitski, Rockwood, 2016, Searle, Mitnitski, Gahbauer, Gill, Rockwood, 2008). Basic versions of the health deficit model implement the feature that the accumulation of health deficits can be slowed down with health care expenditure and accelerated with unhealthy consumption. Here, we take additionally into account that there is an occupation-specific health toll of work. Individuals can choose between an occupation with relatively low return to education and a high health burden and an occupation with high return to education and low health burden. The occupation with high health burden can be conceptualized as (heavy) manual labor.====Health-demanding work leads to a faster accumulation of health deficits and is rewarded with a hazard markup on wages. Although individuals are allowed to change their occupation hence and forth from one time increment to the next, it will be derived that optimally chosen occupations are changed at most twice in the course of the work life and in most cases only once or never. Occupations can thus be conceptualized as life-course careers. Another decisive feature of the model is that labor productivity decreases with the accumulation of health deficits, which provides a natural explanation for a falling wage-for-age curve for elderly workers. Maintaining a healthy body for work thus provides an additional motive for health investments and healthy behavior (beyond the desire for a long life and the direct utility impact of health status).====I calibrate the model for an average American man and an average American woman and show that health-demanding work is ceteris paribus preferred by male, young, and healthy individuals with a relatively low level of education. I show that, for given preferences and initial health, individuals in health-demanding work accumulate health deficits faster than individuals in less-health demanding work. If, however, low-skilled individuals who prefer health-demanding work are forced to take up less health-demanding work, their health deteriorates even faster. This perhaps surprising result is motivated by two mechanisms: (i) in less health-demanding work, the incentive is lower to stay healthy in order to maintain high productivity, (ii) healthy individuals with low levels of education earn less in less-health demanding work. They thus consume less and experience greater marginal utility from consumption. As the marginal utility from instantaneous consumption increases, the incentive declines to invest in health and to reduce unhealthy consumption.====This paper takes up the discussion by Case and Deaton (2005) and resolves some of the problems raised in explaining occupation-related aging. Case and Deaton adopt a simple version of the health capital model (Grossman, 1972) and conclude that, in addition to some general problematic features it is in particular not well suited to explaining the interactions between individual health status and occupational choice. For example, the health capital model implies that, controlling for education, heavy labor is more likely to be undertaken by unhealthy people and that the health gradient between manual and nonmanual workers diminishes with age. Case and Deaton (2005) identify the counterfactual assumption of health capital depreciation as the main cause of the counterfactual implications of the model, a view also emphasized by McFadden (2005). The health capital model conceptualizes aging as loss of health capital, which depreciates at a certain rate (====) as individuals grow older such that ====, in which ==== is the health capital stock at age ====. The depreciation rate ==== may be constant or increasing in age. The health capital model implies that when comparing two individuals of the same age, the individual in better health experiences a faster deterioration in health. This feature generates convergence. It implies that differences in early-life circumstances (fetal origins) are depreciated away as individuals grow older (Almond and Currie, 2011) and that differences of health-burden in early work life are depreciated away in later work life and retirement. Gerontological research, however, supports the opposite: the existence of many health deficits is conducive to the faster development of new health deficits (Gavrilov, Gavrilova, 1991, Mitnitski, Bao, Rockwood, 2006). The self-productive feature of health deficit accumulation is visible as an exponential increase in health deficits with age (Abeliansky, Strulik, 2018a, Abeliansky, Strulik, 2020, Harttgen, Kowal, Strulik, Chatterji, Vollmer, 2013, Mitnitski, Rockwood, 2016, Mitnitski, Mogilner, MacKnight, Rockwood, 2002).====The health deficit model generates the self-productive feature of health deficit accumulation (Dragone and Vanin, 2022). It thus predicts that the health gradient between manual and nonmanual workers increases with age, as observed by Case and Deaton (2005) and confirmed by Abeliansky and Strulik (2021) when health status is measured by the frailty index. The health deficit model furthermore predicts that the health gradient will continue to rise in retirement, after the negative health effects of hard work are gone. The reason is the self-productive nature of health deficit accumulation: manual workers enter retirement with more health deficits, which are conducive to the faster development of additional health deficits.====Aside from eliminating the problematic assumptions and predictions of Case and Deaton's (2005) health capital model of occupational choice, I also extend the theory in various directions. I allow health to affect the age at death and introduce the desire for longevity as an important driver of health behavior and occupational choice. I introduce a retirement period in order to investigate health effects of occupation after retirement. The analysis begins with an exogenous retirement age and is then generalized toward an endogenous choice of retirement in order to investigate the interaction between occupation and retirement. Most importantly, I calibrate the model for an average American man and woman and quantitatively examine the determinants of occupational choice and their impact on health behavior and health outcomes over the life cycle.====The calibrated benchmark individual prefers to spend the whole work life in an occupation with low health burden. An otherwise identical individual with 20 percent less education prefers to spend the first 80 percent of the work life in an occupation with high health burden. The model predicts almost no difference in health behavior (health investments and unhealthy consumption) between the two individuals. The reason is that individuals in health-demanding work have an additional incentive to stay in good health in order to maintain high productivity and to delay leaving the (better paid) health-demanding work. This effect offsets the effect of lower income on health behavior. It means that the predicted health gradient (the individual in health demanding work dies 3 years earlier) can be fully attributed to the direct health burden of work. There is almost no indirect effect from health behavior. Women are predicted to abandon (better paid) health-demanding work earlier in life. This is because women, according the model’s calibration, value instantaneous consumption less than men and good health and a long life more than men. Low-skilled women are predicted to lose about half as much life expectancy as men due to health-demanding work.====Less healthy individuals, ceteris paribus, are predicted to engage less or never in health-demanding work and a high wealth endowment protects individuals from choosing unhealthy occupations. Medical progress is predicted to widen health disparities by education and occupation. This is because medical progress motivates low-skilled individuals to stay longer in health-demanding work, which partly offsets the decelerating effect of medical progress on health deficit accumulation.====Aside from Case and Deaton's (2005) study there is hardly any formal discussion of occupational choice in health economics. Cropper (1977) proposes a simple life cycle model of optimal exposure to pollution and Galama and Van Kippersluis (2019) discuss how the optimal level of job-related stress varies over the life cycle. Both models are formulated in the health capital framework. While Cropper focusses explicitly on pollution, Galama and Van Kippersluis develop a comprehensive and flexible state-of-the-art model of health capital accumulation, in which job-related stress is just one of many applications. Cropper predicts that individuals optimally choose high exposure to pollution as young and old workers and low exposure in middle age while Galama and Van Kippersluis predict that individuals optimally choose high stress levels in middle age and low stress as young and old workers. Aside from its setup in the health deficit framework, the present paper differs conceptually from these studies due to its focus on occupations as lifetime careers, which are changed only occasionally and perhaps never. In contrast to the available studies, the focus is on the determinants of occupational choice in a calibrated model and the impact of occupational choice on health behavior and health outcomes over the life cycle.====The empirical literature on occupational health effects begins with the influential work of Michael Marmot (and coauthors). Based initially on longitudinal studies of British civil servants and then extended in other directions, Marmot argues that occupational status is mainly associated with health status due to job-related stress, social status, and a sense of being in control of one’s life (e.g. Marmot, 2005, Marmot, Ryff, Bumpass, Shipley, Marks, 1997, Marmot, Stansfeld, Patel, North, Head, White, Smith, 1991). Mackenbach et al. (2003) showed that that ratio of mortality rates for manual and non-manual workers increased over time in a sample of six European countries. An early health-economic study by Gueorguieva et al. (2009) examined self-rated health for a sample of older workers from seven waves of the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) and found health effects of occupation on the level of health but not on the speed of aging. Fletcher et al. (2011) constructed measures of physical demands and environmental stress of job characteristics for a sample of US households and found negative effects on self-reported health of individuals working in jobs with high physical demands or harsh conditions, in particular for women and older workers. Morefield et al. (2012) investigated health transitions and observe that workers in physically more demanding jobs are more likely to transit from good to bad health but do not have different probabilities of health improvements. As Case and Deaton (2005), they found that the health differential between blue and white collar workers increases with age. The observed health transitions are consistent with the health deficit model when health transitions are conceptualized as a Markov chain (Grossmann, Strulik, 2019, Mitnitski, Bao, Rockwood, 2006).====Kelly et al. (2014) examined occupational effects on health behavior and found that blue collar work early in life is associated with increased probabilities of obesity and smoking, and decreased physical activity later in life. Combining data from the health and retirement study with expert ratings of job demands, Schmitz (2016) provided evidence for a persistent health gap between blue and white collar workers, which loses significance after controlling for physical and psychosocial job demands. Ravesteijn et al. (2018) investigated health satisfaction in a panel of German workers. Controlling for individual fixed effects, they showed that health of blue collar workers declines more strongly with age than that of white collar workers, corroborating the results from Case and Deaton and Morefield et al. An increasing health gradient is also observed when occupations are classified according to the degree of physical workload and by degree of job control. Controlling for selection by lagged health, they argue that at least 60 percent of the association between occupation and health is explained by selection. Nicholas et al. (2020) show that lifetime exposure to occupational demands affects health and disability later in life. Abeliansky and Strulik (2021) computed the frailty index for individuals from a panel of European countries and found that blue collar workers, workers with little education, and workers in occupations with high physical or psychosocial burden display more health deficits and accumulate health deficits faster. While the age-occupation interaction loses significance with entry into retirement, workers in occupations of high health burden continue to age faster in retirement because they entered retirement with more health deficits. The presence of many health deficits in retirement leads to faster aging due to the self-productive nature of health deficit accumulation.====A problem that is emphasized in nearly all empirical studies is endogenous selection into occupations. The present paper provides an alternative approach to identify selection effects by computing comparative dynamics of the calibrated model. Computational experiments make it possible to observe life cycle behavior and health outcomes of one and the same individual twice, in the self-selected (optimal) occupation and in another life with a pre-assigned occupation.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In the next Section, I set up the model and derive the dynamic equations that govern life cycle behavior and occupational choice. In Section 3, the model is calibrated for an average 20-year-old American man in the year 2010. Section 4 presents the main results. In Section 5, the model is extended to include an endogenous retirement decision. In Section 6, the model is applied to occupational choice and health behavior of women. Section 7 concludes the paper.","A health economic theory of occupational choice, aging, and longevity",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629622000194,5 February 2022,2022,Research Article,76.0

This variation has been attributed to productivity spillovers across physicians in high-use areas (Chandra and Staiger 2007; Epstein and Nicholson 2009; Dranove et al., 2011), local information spillovers driven by opinion leaders (Agha and Molitor 2018), heterogeneous beliefs across physicians about treatment effectiveness (Cutler et al., 2019), and physicians exhibiting heterogeneous diagnostic skills (Currie and MacLeod 2017; Chan et al., 2019; Currie and MacLeod 2020).====This paper proposes a new mechanism - heterogeneity in task-specific skill across physicians - as a key contributor to the variation in practice patterns across physicians. The role of individuals’ task-specific skill in determining choice has long been documented in the economics literature (Roy 1950; Miller 1984; Heckman and Honoré 1990). In medical care, the command of multiple skills by a single physician may result in a set of competencies, where substitutable tasks represent alternative ways (e.g., medical procedures) to treat patients. However, empirical evidence on how such heterogeneity in physicians’ procedure-specific skills affects their choices of treatments remains limited. In this paper, we fill this gap in the literature and show how a negative information shock to treatment effectiveness affects physicians’ technology abandonment decisions differentially depending on their relative skill in performing two alternative surgical interventions (one subject of the negative information shock and the other not).====In the past three decades, many surgical procedures transitioned from a standard, open surgical approach to a minimally invasive one (Barbash and Glied 2010). This technological transition requires the acquisition of very different task-specific skills compared with open procedures Noar (1991) and had an impact on physician productivity (Epstein et al., 2013) as well as contributed to geographical variation in physician behavior (Baicker et al., 2006; Kuo et al., 2017). In this paper, we examine physician choice in hysterectomies, a specific clinical setting where surgeons commonly perform both minimally invasive (MI) and open surgery for women diagnosed with uterine fibroids and related diseases. While the two alternative surgical techniques require very different clinical skills, they are close substitutes as treatment options. By contrast, previous literature on physician choice of technology focused on C-section versus normal delivery for childbirth, intensive therapy versus medical management for treating heart patients (Chandra and Staiger 2007; Currie et al., 2016), and (Currie and MacLeod 2017), and alternative drug treatments (Currie and MacLeod 2020).====The goal of this paper is to understand the role of physician relative skill (i.e., the skill of performing a procedure relative to the alternative procedure) in governing surgical procedural choice. Specifically, we ask how physicians’ response to negative information shock on the appropriateness of tasks depends on their relative skill levels. Negative news regarding treatment effectiveness should alter the choice of treatment and may lead to gradual or swift abandonment of the technology in question. Our empirical analysis uses patient-level administrative data from Florida. The data allows us to measure both patient appropriateness and surgeons’ relative skill in performing the two alternative procedures. Using a leave-out instrumental variable for individual physicians’ skill levels, we show that after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) unexpectedly issued a safety communication that lowered the attractiveness of MI hysterectomies, surgeons with relatively higher skill in open versus MI procedures were more likely to alter their procedural mix towards open hysterectomies and away from MI hysterectomies. Since surgeons with relatively higher open skills were more likely to use open procedures even before the FDA announcement, we find that practice variation across physicians with different relative skill levels increased substantially after the information shock. This finding highlights the importance of human capital in explaining practice variation. To better understand and provide insights into the empirical results, we also develop a simple theoretical model on physicians’ technology abandonment decision in response to negative information shock, where physicians’ technology-choice decision is a function of their relative skill, their patients’ appropriateness of using either procedure, and the perceived effectiveness of each procedure, which can be affected by the information shock.====The literature on technology abandonment is fairly thin and heavily focused on measuring the speed of abandonment. Recent literature on technology abandonment is focused on uncovering potential mechanisms for abandonment beyond the informational shocks. These mechanisms help explain the heterogeneity in abandonment across seemingly similar providers, and include variation in organizational environments and reimbursement levels (Howard et al., 2017), peer effects (Berez et al., 2018), overconfidence (Comin et al., 2017), as well as different behavioral explanations (Roman and Asch 2014; Ubel and Asch 2015; Staats et al., 2018). This paper, as we will detail later on, argues that variation in relative skill across alternative procedures is linked to the extent of technology abandonment across surgeons. Bekelis et al. (2017) makes the important distinction between the terms “de-adoption,” which refers to the total relinquishment of an activity, and “exnovation,” which refers to scaling back that activity. In this paper, we chose the term “abandonment” to capture elements of de-adoption, as in the case of the technology targeted by the FDA, as well as exnovation, as in the case of minimally invasive hysterectomies.====The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides the clinical and institutional background. Section 3 details the theoretical framework. Section 4 describes the data and the empirical measure of physician skill. Section 5 highlights the identification strategy. Section 6 shows the results.

Through a randomized trial involving 251 primary schools in western China, we tested two approaches to improve the cost-effectiveness of a program distributing free eyeglasses to myopic children. Relative to delivery of free eyeglasses to schools, we find that providing vouchers redeemable in local optical shops modestly improved the targeting of eyeglasses to those who would use them without reducing effective coverage. Information provided through a health education campaign increased eyeglass use when eyeglasses were delivered to schools, but had no effect when requiring voucher redemption or when families were only given a prescription for eyeglasses to be purchased on the market. Though most expensive, free delivery to schools with a health education campaign was the most socially cost-effective approach tested and increased effective coverage of eyeglasses by 18.5 percentage points after seven months.","The World Health Organization estimates that more than 1 billion people globally live with visual impairment that is either fully treatable or could have been prevented (WHO, 2019). More than 90% of these individuals live in developing countries (Bourne et al., 2017). The most common cause of visual impairment is refractive error which, in the vast majority of cases, can be completely corrected by properly-fitted eyeglasses (Steinmetz et al., 2021). The private and social costs of uncorrected refractive error are substantial, particularly among children among whom vision impairment is associated with impaired cognitive, language, and socio-emotional development (Warren, 1994); academic achievement (Resnikoff et al., 2008); and self-esteem (Augestad, 2017).====We study alternative approaches to improve the cost-effectiveness of programs providing subsidized eyeglasses to myopic children through schools in rural China. Like programs providing many other types of subsidized health products, a challenge is that ensuring access alone is not enough: Eyeglasses require active use for their benefits to be realized. The effectiveness of programs providing eyeglasses therefore depends not on ownership, but on the effective coverage (rates of eyeglass use) attained. As a result, cost-effectiveness can be undermined if subsidized eyeglasses go unused. Moreover, subsidized eyeglasses may displace existing demand at market prices, further compromising cost-effectiveness.====Given the potential for waste due to non-use, the cost-effectiveness of programs providing subsidized health goods like eyeglasses can be improved by (a) targeting to individuals most likely to use them (on the extensive margin); and (b) increasing usage among those acquiring a good (on the intensive margin). Although it has been argued that charging a positive price (cost-sharing) can improve cost effectiveness through these channels, empirical evidence suggests that – for a variety of preventative health goods – charging even a modest price can significantly dampen demand and screen out a significant number of beneficiaries who would have used these products if provided for free, thus undermining the primary policy goal of increasing usage (Dupas and Miguel, 2017).====Through a randomized trial across 251 primary schools in western China, we test two non-price approaches to improve the cost-effectiveness of distributing fully-subsidized eyeglasses and compare these to providing prescriptions alone. The first approach is to apply an ordeal mechanism by providing families of myopic children with vouchers for free eyeglasses that are only redeemable at designated optometry shops. Relative to providing free eyeglasses directly, the non-monetary cost imposed by requiring voucher redemption may better target eyeglasses to those who will use them. The second approach, providing information about the benefits of eyeglass use through a health education campaign, can improve cost-effectiveness by increasing the rate or intensity of usage among recipients. Because subsidies and information campaigns are commonly implemented simultaneously and are likely to interact in important ways for experience goods like eyeglasses, we also test how the effects of an ordeal and information interact and jointly impact take-up and use.====We use a cross-cutting experimental design to compare these approaches and their interaction to two comparison groups: directly delivering free eyeglasses to myopic children at school and to a “market” condition. All 19,934 fourth- and fifth-grade children in these schools were screened for myopia, and parents of children found to be myopic were notified. We then randomly assigned schools to one of three distribution groups: a “Free Delivery” group, in which eyeglasses were delivered to schools and dispensed directly to the students; a “Voucher” group, in which vouchers were provided for free eyeglasses redeemable at designated optometry shops in the county seat; and a “Market” group, in which caregivers were only given an accurate prescription for eyeglasses which they could use when purchasing eyeglasses in the existing market. Half of the schools within each of these distribution groups were then randomly chosen to receive a “Health Education” campaign for students, parents, and teachers that extolled the benefits of eyeglasses and addressed common types of misinformation. Using this experimental design, we compare the effects of each type of distribution scheme, and their interaction with health education, on acquisition and use of eyeglasses one month and seven months after initial distribution.====We emphasize three main findings. First, the price of eyeglasses, but not a lack of information on the benefits of eyeglass use, appears to be a major barrier to the acquisition of eyeglasses in this context. Relative to the Market group (prescription only), providing vouchers for free eyeglasses increased ownership after seven months by 51 percentage points (a 131% increase from a base of 39%). Providing information through the health education campaign, on the other hand, had little effect on ownership.====Second, we find that, relative to Free Delivery, the ordeal mechanism (voucher redemption) modestly improved targeting efficiency. The ordeal selected out approximately 12% of individuals that would not have used glasses if freely distributed to students at schools. The use of eyeglasses (as measured though unannounced visits to schools) was as high in voucher schools as in the free delivery schools, suggesting that the ordeal did not select-out individuals who would have used eyeglasses if freely delivered (or did not select individuals in a way that reduced overall use rates). Although targeting efficiency was highest in the Market group, “effective coverage” (defined as usage unconditional on ownership) was approximately 12 percentage points higher in the Voucher and Free Delivery groups relative to the Market group after seven months (an increase of nearly 30 percent).====Third, although it was ineffective at increasing ownership in any of the distribution groups, the Health Education campaign was effective in increasing ==== – but only when glasses were freely delivered to schools. Health education had no detectable effect on usage when glasses were distributed through an ordeal mechanism or when individuals needed to purchase eyeglasses in the market. Providing information increased usage in the free distribution group by approximately 19 percentage points after one month and 8 percentage points in the seven-month follow-up (a 21% increase).====Taken together, our results at seven months after the initial distribution show that free delivery with the health education campaign achieved the highest overall rate of effective coverage out of the policy options examined. Moreover, this combination of interventions was the most cost-effective—both in terms of “programmatic” costs (implementation costs) and social costs that account for deadweight loss due to the ordeal imposed by vouchers—relative to only providing prescriptions with no health education. Given the patterns of use that we find, vouchers would have had to screen out approximately 48 percent more individuals without reducing the overall rate of use in order to be as cost-effective as free delivery with information. Requiring an ordeal costly enough achieve this level of screening, though, would impose a deadweight loss large enough to fully offset gains from improved targeting.====Our findings extend the literature on the effects of subsidies and information on the adoption of health goods in developing countries (see Kremer and Glennerster, 2011; Dupas and Miguel, 2017 for reviews). A focus of this literature has been on how pricing (cost-sharing) affects access and the targeting of products to users. Experimental studies randomizing price offers have found that demand for many preventative health products is highly elastic.==== As a result, higher prices tend to screen out those likely to benefit, reducing cost-effectiveness and undermining the policy goal of increasing coverage.==== Evidence on whether higher prices effectively target those likely to use products is more mixed. For instance, Ashraf et al. (2010) find that higher prices do screen out those who would use water chlorine less, while Cohen and Dupas (2010) in Kenya find no evidence that cost sharing reduces wastage of bed nets (ITNs).====Existing evidence on whether targeting through inconvenience (such as an ordeal mechanism) is more limited. Although more extensively studied in the context of other social programs,==== we're aware of only two prior studies with application to health good subsidies. Dupas et al. (2016) conduct a field experiment to examine the effects of a “micro-ordeal” in the distribution of chlorine solution for water treatment, also in Kenya. They find that requiring households to redeem monthly coupons for free chlorine screened out 88 percent of non-users while achieving only slightly lower effective coverage relative to free distribution, suggesting a substantial increase in cost-effectiveness. Though the focus is on a different dimension of targeting, Hoffmann (2018) finds evidence from an experiment measuring willingness-to-pay for water purifiers among households living in slum neighborhoods in Hyperbad, India that non-monetary prices better target poor households than monetary prices.====Our findings contribute to this literature primarily, first, by studying the targeting efficiency of monetary and non-monetary costs for a product with different attributes of those previously studied. Beyond having more or less elastic demand,==== eyeglasses present a different scope for learning about benefits and costs of product use over time compared to preventative goods like bednets and water treatment. The scope for positive and negative learning can influence the effects of subsidies for experience goods because perceptions of net benefits may change between the time of the take-up/purchase decision and use over time (Fischer et al., 2019). Our findings suggest that market prices screen out a large fraction of potential eyeglass wearers but, in line with Dupas et al. (2016), non-monetary costs imposed by the ordeal do not.====Our second main contribution is to test how information and the subsidy distribution method interact in their effect on demand and effective coverage. Similar to Meredith et al. (2013) who experimentally test the effect of providing information on purchase decisions in several contexts, we find little effect of information on total demand (good acquisition). We also find no effect on implied elasticity (difference in acquisition between the market and free arms in our case).==== In terms of eyeglass ====, however, information and distribution method do interact. Though effective under free delivery, information does not increase use under the ordeal.==== As a result, the relative cost-effectiveness of free delivery and the voucher mechanism is switched when information is provided. This is because with information, the amount of waste due to non-use is no longer smaller under the voucher mechanism and it screens out individuals who would have used eyeglasses if freely delivered, while also imposing additional cost on voucher recipients.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows.

We estimate that the elasticity of R&D effort with respect to market size is about ==== in the cross-section of diseases. We establish this cross-sectional relationship between the market size of a disease (measured as the disease-level mortality risk at the national level weighted by national income levels) and R&D effort (measured as new clinical trials), by matching data on world-wide clinical trials to 75 broad disease categories that have a non-negligible death burden. We estimate an elasticity strictly less than 1 (and around ====) across all disease categories and also within sub-categories (such as cancer or infectious diseases) with the ==== of the univariate regressions ranging from about 0.3 to 0.5. As discussed in ====, this result is consistent with previous empirical studies which have typically found that the elasticity of research effort with respect to market size is below one.====#2. We document that the R&D response to COVID-19 has been 4 to 26 times greater than that implied by the historical relationship between market size and R&D effort.====#3. Based on the COVID-19 episode we find that, even in the short term, the aggregate elasticity of science and innovation can be very large. We document that in the initial months of the pandemic up to 50% of newly started trials were directed towards COVID-19. And, despite the large increase in COVID-19 R&D, overall new clinical trials increased by 38% in 2020 with little crowding out of R&D effort for other diseases.====#4. We find that public research institutions were a key driver of the COVID-19 R&D effort—accounting for 70% of all COVID-19 clinical trials globally, and being 10 percentage points more likely to conduct a COVID-19 trial relative to private firms. In addition, studying the speed of COVID-19 vaccine development, we find U.S. and Chinese candidates were on average 2 months faster than candidates from other countries. This crucial boost in speed was possibly due to greater provision of early-stage incentives by the policy response in these countries, including through programs such as Operation Warp Speed (OWS).====Our findings have three broad implications for the study of innovation. First, our findings suggest that ====Second, our findings suggest that ==== However, COVID-19 innovation proceeded rapidly without governments committing to pay developers and manufacturers above average costs for effective vaccines or drug treatments.==== We find a strong role of public research institutions in driving COVID-19 innovation, accounting for 70% of COVID-19 clinical trials. Moreover, when compared to private firms, we find that public research institutions were 10 percentage points more likely to pursue clinical trials to fight COVID-19. In addition, we observe several important COVID-19 pharmaceutical innovations being driven by public research institutions with no explicit monetary incentives.====Third, based on the experience of COVID-19 our work suggests that ==== In this context, the experience of COVID-19 suggests that scaling up innovation may require a better understanding of non-monetary incentives or intrinsic motivations, and also a more active role by governments in providing early-stage R&D incentives.====While we have discussed the size of R&D response and have also studied the subset of clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines, we have paid less attention to the optimal composition and quality of research effort that may be affected when innovation is scaled up quickly (see ====). Also, one reason for the large COVID-19 R&D response could be the newness of COVID-19, which could make the expected marginal return from investing in the disease much higher than for other diseases (in the presence of decreasing returns to scale). While this could be an important contributing factor, our data does not allow us to further investigate this possibility as we have no new diseases of comparable scale in our dataset. Still, the rapid and large R&D response to COVID-19 suggests that scarcity of ideas and talent may not be a prohibitive barrier to scaling up innovation—at least for new diseases.====Overall, the COVID-19 R&D response raises the distinct possibility that global innovation in the future can be scaled up significantly.

A key question is how have some nursing homes been able to effectively protect their residents, while others have not? Using data on the universe of US nursing homes, we examine whether establishment quality is predictive of COVID-19 mortality. Higher-quality nursing homes, as measured by CMS overall five-star rating, have substantially lower COVID-19 mortality through September of 2020. Quality does not predict the ability to prevent any COVID-19 resident or staff cases, but higher-quality establishments prevent the spread of resident infections conditional on having one. Preventing COVID-19 cases and deaths may come at some cost, as high-quality homes have substantially higher non-COVID deaths. The positive correlation between establishment quality and non-COVID mortality is strong enough that high-quality homes also have more total deaths than their low-quality counterparts and this relationship has grown with time. As of late April 2021, five-star homes have experienced 8.4 percent more total deaths than one-star homes.","The COVID-19 pandemic in the US has been particularly devastating for residents of nursing homes. As of August 15th, 2021, there were a total of 634,179 COVID-19-related deaths in the US.==== We estimate that 21 percent of these deaths are among nursing home residents.==== Through the end of 2020, the death rate for non-nursing home residents was about 87 per 100,000. The death rate for nursing home residents is more than 108 times that number at roughly 9200 per 100,000. The death rate in nursing homes is more 23 times larger than the death rate for those 65 and over outside of nursing homes, which we calculate to be about 390 per 100,000. In at least five states, Rhode Island, Indiana, New Jersey, South Dakota, and Connecticut, more than 12 percent of the nursing home population at the beginning of 2020 had died by the end of the year with COVID-19.====COVID-19 deaths among nursing home ====In this work, we focus on one particular dimension of the problem: nursing home quality. Starting in 2008, the Centers for Medicare and ==== (PPE) outages. Furthermore, we show that high-quality homes tested residents and staff more frequently and received test results faster than low-quality homes. Consistent with high-quality homes simply following CMS guidelines more closely, we also show that once vaccines were made available, high-quality homes vaccinated residents and staff at a higher rate.====A likely scenario is that higher-quality establishments also did a better job of isolating residents from risks associated with both outside visitors and other residents. On March 13th, 2020, CMS recommended that nursing homes (i) restrict visitors and non-essential personnel from entering the home and (ii) cancel in-person dining and other group activities (====).====; ====; ====). A nationwide survey of nursing home residents by Altarum, a non-profit healthcare company, documents similar concerns (====) and mortality among the elderly (====). According to CDC provisional data, there were 56,464 excess deaths (i.e., realized deaths above that which is predicted using historical averages) among Alzheimer's patients through early October of 2021;==== however, only 22,709 or 40 percent had a corresponding positive COVID-19 diagnosis,==== leaving 60 percent of these excess deaths not directly related to the disease but to other aspects of the pandemic.==== contract COVID-19. The resident survey mentioned above also documents severe isolation, finding that only 5 percent of respondents had visitors three or more times per week, compared to 56 percent before the pandemic, and just 13 percent reported dining in a communal setting, compared to 69 percent before the pandemic. Another possibly is that resident contact restrictions may coincide with, or even cause, a reduction in interactions with healthcare providers, both inside and outside the home, which would be consistent with widely documented reductions in healthcare receipt overall during the early stages of the pandemic (====; ====; ====; ====).====Given the number of COVID-19-related deaths and an early understanding that the elderly die at higher rates, there is surprisingly little research on deaths in nursing homes. As a result, this paper contributes to the literature on the health effects of COVID-19 along several dimensions. A number of papers have examined the general relationship between CMS five-star ratings and COVID-19 cases and/or deaths in nursing homes but much of this work was either in a single state (====; ====; ====; ====) or occurred very early in the pandemic (====). Some studies have used various versions of the CMS data used in this study. ==== show that county incidence rates are the strongest predictor of resident mortality and staff levels have modest impacts on the spread of the disease. ==== document much higher COVID-19 death rates in homes with a larger share of minority patients. ==== show that contractors that service multiple nursing homes in a local area helped spread the disease. The data from the CDC showing large excess death rates for the elderly and especially Alzheimer's patients has helped put this issue into the public discussion, yet there is little research other than efforts to document the extent of the problem and almost no research on the factors that lead to excess mortality.====While much of the previous work studies determinants of outbreaks, only a few studies such as (====) and ==== mortality than low-quality homes.==== in such an environment.==== We offer two takeaways.====First, an organization's capacity to perform well in the face of adversity may be an important dimension of its quality. Such capacity is difficult to measure across organizations because adversity may not be observable and is rarely evenly distributed. The COVID-19 pandemic offers CMS an observable ==== that affected all nursing homes. CMS should consider capitalizing on this opportunity by evaluating nursing home responses to the COVID-19 shock and integrating this evaluation into their quality metrics.====Second, through September of 2020, CMS guidelines clearly prioritized reducing nursing home resident exposure to COVID-19. Guidelines focused on proper PPE use, testing protocols, and isolating residents from the outside world and one another. COVID-19 cases and deaths were publicized and widely reported in the news media. Our results suggest that in response, the best nursing homes “hit their marks,” i.e., they followed guidelines and, for a time, avoided the bad health outcome of focus. That said, we show that these homes witnessed the most total death in the long-run. In the future, we hope that these findings serve as a reminder that even early guidelines and objective health metrics should be cognizant of resident ==== at large.====We downloaded the CMS Covid-19 Nursing Home data file on August 2nd, 2021, which contains information reported through the week of July 18th, 2021; 61 weeks total. Our analysis is limited to the weeks ending May 24th, 2020 through May 9th, 2021; 51 weeks. Over this time-frame, 15,421 homes report data to CMS in at least one week. Squaring the data produces 786,471 home-week observations. Roughly 10 percent of these observations are missing or are flagged by CMS for poor quality (henceforth, “problem” observations); however, a small minority of homes account for most of the errors. We drop all homes with more than ten problem observations; 15,110 homes and 770,610 observations remain, which includes just 4574 problem observations (0.59 percent of all observations), 28 percent of which are in the first two weeks of reporting.====Cumulative death counts are calculated by CMS from weekly death reports; thus, any problem observations create measurement error in all cumulative counts moving forward. As such, we impute weekly death counts for all problem observations and recalculate the cumulative counts using the procedure that follows. ====: For the weeks ending May 2nd and May 9th of 2021 (not used in any regression analysis in the paper), we regress weekly COVID-19 deaths and weekly non-COVID deaths on new county COVID-19 cases and the number of beds, as well as quadratics of these variables, for all non-problem observations. We then use the regression coefficients to predict weekly COVID and non-COVID deaths for problem observations in these weeks. ====: Starting with the week ending April 25th, 2021 (the last week used in regression analysis in the paper), we predict weekly COVID (non-COVID) deaths for problem observations using new county COVID cases and the number of beds, as well as quadratics of these variables, ==== COVID (non-COVID) deaths over the following two weeks at the nursing home. ====: repeats step 2 recursively for the weeks ending April 18th, 2021 through May 24th, 2020.====Finally, note that among the 15,110 homes that comprise our final CMS sample (e.g., see summary statistics in Appendix ====), 205 homes cannot be matched to a home in the star-quality data, which explains the sample size of 14,905 in our main regression analysis.","Nursing home quality, COVID-19 deaths, and excess mortality",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629622000121,21 January 2022,2022,Research Article,82.0

We find child-specific son preference to be more common among later born children and in families with fewer sons. Using the novel measure and an interaction ,"In India, son preference is persistent and well-documented. The preference for sons is rooted in cultural customs, religious and social beliefs, and economic incentives (Das Gupta, 1987, Das Gupta, Zhenghua, Bohua, Zhenming, Chung, Hwa-Ok, 2003, Pande, Astone, 2007, Robitaille, 2013). The implications for women and girls are significant. From early in life daughters are breastfed for a shorter period, receive less childcare time, fewer vaccinations and vitamin supplements, are less likely to be hospitalized, are shorter, and suffer excess mortality via abortion, infanticide and neglect.==== However, discrimination against girls does not merely occur because of unequal treatment of boys and girls within families, but also because of parents’ son-biased fertility behavior that leads to girls living in larger families with fewer resources per child (Jayachandran, Kuziemko, 2011, Jayachandran, Pande, 2017, Jensen, 2003, Rosenblum, 2013). In families that do not have the desired number of sons, daughters are increasingly more unwanted as birth order rises and fewer birth trials remain. To satisfy son preferences, some parents engage in son-biased fertility behavior and exceed the planned family size in trying to conceive a boy (Bongaarts, 2013, Clark, 2000). Jayachandran and Kuziemko (2011) illustrate how the gender gap in breastfeeding increases with birth order, because girls are weaned early to accelerate the birth of a potential son. Sex-selective abortion and female infanticide are alternatives to son-biased fertility and are also more commonly practiced among later born children (Bhalotra, Cochrane, 2010, Jha, Kesler, Kumar, Ram, Ram, Aleksandrowicz, Bassani, Chandra, Banthia, 2011, Klasen, 2003, Muhuri, Preston, 1991).====With this paper we contribute to the literature in two ways. First, we propose an innovative measure of son preference, which relates the preference to a specific child. We ask pregnant women about the preferred sex of the child they are pregnant with. Measured this way, son preference can be studied as a function of previous birth outcomes. Child-specific sex preferences further allow us to distinguish between children that satisfy the mother’s sex preference and those that don’t when studying the ramifications of son preferences for children. Second, we study children’s mental development as an outcome of mothers’ son preference.====Existing son preference measures typically either indirectly measure son preference based on fertility behavior at aggregate levels or capture a static preference for the sex composition of children at the individual level. The more boys are desired given the ideal family size, the more intensive is the individual level son preference (Jayachandran, 2017, Jensen, 2003, Norling, 2018, Palloni, 2017, Pande, Astone, 2007, Robitaille, 2013).==== However, son preference may change with birth order and sex composition of existing children, or simply over time, and for that reason it is important to consider child-specific measures. Child-specific measures allow us to better understand the dynamics and path-dependence of son preference with respect to previous births. In addition, the child-specific measure reveals sex preferences that would remain undetected in sex composition preference measures (desired number of boys relative to all children), such as the preference for an eldest son but no preference for the remaining children.====Studies that investigate the consequences of son preference for children typically compare the outcomes of boys and girls (Asfaw, Lamanna, Klasen, 2010, Barcellos, Carvalho, Lleras-Muney, 2014, Bhalotra, Cochrane, 2010, Jayachandran, Kuziemko, 2011, Jayachandran, Pande, 2017, Oster, 2009). Palloni (2017) argues that such comparisons measure the average discrimination at the population level and highlights the importance of child-specific sex preference measuress to quantify the discrimination coefficient. He uses panel data from Indonesia and the preferred sex composition of potential future children to estimate the discrimination coefficient on children’s health. Jayachandran and Kuziemko (2011) and Jayachandran and Pande (2017) rely on heterogeneous effects by the region’s sex ratio and mothers’ realized preference for the number of sons (i.e. the number of current sons equaling the number of currently desired sons) to proxy heterogeneity in discrimination potential. Our son preference measure avoids bias from measuring population level averages by being specific to the child the mother is pregnant with, irrespective of her sex composition preference.====A crucial argument in favour of studying early childhood development is that it lays the foundation for lifelong human capital accumulation (e.g., Attanasio, 2015, Heckman, 2000). Arguably more importantly, this evidence can inform how we think about son preference, precisely because the home environment is so important. Responsive caregiving, reduced stress, positive experiences and learning opportunities are key inputs to children’s cognitive and social development (Black, Walker, Fernald, Andersen, DiGirolamo, Lu, McCoy, Fink, Shawar, Shiffman, et al., 2017, Walker, Wachs, Grantham-McGregor, Black, Nelson, Huffman, Baker-Henningham, Chang, Hamadani, Lozoff, Gardner, Powell, Rahman, Richter, 2011, Walker, Wachs, Meeks Gardner, Lozoff, Wasserman, Pollitt, Carter, 2007). Child-specific son preferences may have crucial effects on parents’ caregiving and the home environment. When the preferred sex does not match the realized sex, parents’ regret may result in a more stressful and less loving environment. The resentment is likely to intensify with birth order, because it results in either being short of sons, extending family size or using sex selection. The home environment may therefore differ for boys and girls of son-preferring mothers within the family, irrespective of overall resource constraints, leading to differential investments into boys and girls based on their differential expected future payoffs (Asfaw, Lamanna, Klasen, 2010, Barcellos, Carvalho, Lleras-Muney, 2014, Bhalotra, Chakravarty, Gulesci, 2020, Jayachandran, Pande, 2017, Kugler, Kumar, 2017, Rosenblum, 2013).====We measure the child-specific son preference of 1961 women in one district of the Indian state of Bihar and establish that, in accordance with expectations, son preference is more common towards later-born children and in families with fewer sons. At birth order three, the probability of having a son preference is 60 percentage points higher than at birth order one. At a given birth order, mothers with one son are 40 percentage points less likely to have a son preference than mothers without sons.====Next, we estimate the penalty in cognitive and non-cognitive functions faced by daughters who did not satisfy their mothers’ child-specific son preference. We label this the son-preference-specific girl penalty in early skills. We use a model that interacts child-specific son preference with the sex of the child of interest and controls for both indicators separately. The interaction term indicates the unrealized son preference and its coefficient measures the son-preference-specific girl penalty. We estimate the son-preference-specific girl penalty by OLS and instrumental variables. In the OLS estimation, we address in detail selection into the interaction of son preference and child’s sex, focusing on sex selective abortion and son-biased fertility. In the instrumental variables estimation, we use the firstborn’s sex and the interaction of the firstborn’s sex with the sex of the child of interest as instruments, assuming that sex selection is rare among firstborns and son preference is less common in families with firstborn sons.====We find a son-preference-specific girl penalty of about a quarter of a standard deviation in overall development, language and socioemotional skills based on OLS estimations. The IV estimates are much higher at 0.68 standard deviations in overall development and also show a significant son-preference-specific girl penalty in cognitive skills. There is no evidence that motor development is affected by son preferences. The interaction set-up of our empirical strategy allows us to disentangle how much of the son-preference-specific girl penalty is due to discrimination against girls and how much is due to preferential treatment of boys of son-preferring mothers. To calculate the discrimination component we subtract the preferential treatment component, which is the difference in outcomes between boys of son-preferring and non-son-preferring mothers, from the son-preference-specific girl penalty. The results suggest that both discrimination against girls and preferential treatment of boys contribute to the son-preference-specific girl penalty in early skills.====To investigate the mechanisms from son preference to mental development, we consider children’s health, parental inputs (e.g. postnatal care visits), and mothers’ mental health and empowerment as potential mediators. While we do find some evidence that son preference affects girls’ wasting and anemia status as well as mothers’ participation in decisions regarding the family diet and children’s feeding, we find no evidence that these factors indeed function as mediators from son preference to children’s mental development.====The evidence on children’s early mental development is relevant because it (i) illustrates the potential loss in human capital due to son preference, (ii) demonstrates that it is empirically important to distinguish between child-specific son-preferring and non-son-preferring attitudes of mothers, and (iii) suggests that son preference may shape the home environment. Although, we cannot directly measure the son-preference-specific girl penalty in mothers’ care and attention for their children, our results encourage to study how a nurturing home environment can be established. In the short term, one way forward may be to improve nurturing care of girls through effective early childhood development interventions in the presence of continuing gender discrimination (Attanasio, 2015). In the long term, researchers and policy makers must focus on the depletion of son preferences in the first place to overcome unequal treatment. Traditional gender norms are known to be sticky and interlinked with religious and cultural aspects (Jayachandran, 2015). While financial incentives for parents to raise girls have shown to pervert the sex composition to one boy families (e.g., Anukriti, 2018), economic empowerment and representation of women in politics and the media have shown to effectively reduce gender bias (Beaman, Duflo, Pande, Topalova, 2012, Carranza, 2014, Field, Pande, Rigol, Schaner, Moore, 2021, Jensen, Oster, 2009, Qian, 2008, Ting, Ao, Lin, 2014). In the future, similar interventions should be evaluated with respect to their impact on nurturing care of girls.====The paper is structured as follows.

An important empirical challenge with evaluating the impacts of these policies is the endogenous nature of their implementation (==== providers.====Additionally, we examine changes in telemedicine and in-person office visits because many providers have shifted towards telemedicine services during the pandemic, based on recommendations from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (====).

Consistent with the existing literature, we also find that even after controlling for variations in the intensity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the implementation of SIP policies led to a 10% reduction in the use of office-based clinician visits and a 53% increase in the use of telemedicine. However, the absolute change in telemedicine only offset 48% of the reduction in office-based clinician visits. Our results echo previous work which has also confirmed that telemedicine visits have not fully replaced office-based visits (====).====We believe that these results have several important implications for public policy.

Technological progress has also been made in medical procedures, including, but certainly not limited to, relatively noninvasive surgeries for heart attacks, improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of strokes, surgical solutions for various types of cancer, and a variety of effective mental health treatments. Some new procedures involve new medical devices but, as we will show, the majority do not.====A rich economics literature examines firm investments in medical innovations. This literature has primarily focused on investments in ==== innovations and how the resulting drugs diffuse into clinical practice.==== Most of these studies examine the development of new molecular entities (NMEs), which are the most innovative forms of new drugs (in contrast with generics and reformulations/combinations of existing drugs). This focus likely reflects the fact that both the economic model and the regulatory process governing the development of NMEs are more clearly understood. Further, data about each stage of NME development are more widely available, and NMEs usually generate the highest welfare gains.====Economists have devoted far less attention to the development of new medical procedures. Extant studies focus on the approval process for new devices. We show that such innovation represents a minority of new procedures and only a small portion of the overall development process. As a result, little is known about how novel procedures are developed, let alone whether this process is optimal. We fill this gap in the existing literature by examining the underlying economics, rules, and regulations governing the innovative process for medical procedures. As has been done for drugs, we focus on the most innovative forms of new procedures – those that cannot be described by existing Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT codes. These codes are used by virtually all providers and payers for medical record keeping and billing.====The broad economic decisions facing innovators are the same for both products and procedures. Potential innovators must make large, sunk investments in research and development, with uncertain prospects about whether these investments will translate into successful treatments. Despite this fundamental economic similarity, and the potentially large welfare gains afforded by both types of technologies, the regulatory and legal frameworks governing the development of new medical products and procedures are vastly different in ways that can influence both the amount and scope of innovation. Section 2 of this paper contrasts the rules and regulations governing innovative drugs and procedures, including key differences in property rights. One key difference is the important role played by the American Medical Association (AMA), which owns the copyright to the CPT codes and solely manages the assignment process for new codes.==== Section 3 introduces the novel data set, provided by the AMA, that we use to examine procedure innovation and presents basic facts about the approval process for new procedures. Section 4 shows how the granting of new CPT codes by the AMA has a profound impact on the diffusion of new procedures. Section 5 presents additional evidence on the innovative process for procedures, including evidence on the pace of innovation and the ways that innovators overcome limited property rights. Section 6 concludes.====Among our key findings, we demonstrate that the timeline for discovering, developing, and (perhaps most importantly) commercializing novel procedures is far longer than that suggested by prior research on the regulatory process for medical devices (Makower et al., 2010; Stern 2017). This difference results primarily from the fact that previous studies focused on specific stages of the development process and/or could not observe the administrative process determining reimbursement. Looking at the entirety of the development process, we document an average lag of over ten years, comparable to the timeline for new drugs. In addition, we find that this process contains additional uncertainty about whether even successful innovations will be reimbursed by payers and/or implemented by providers. Specifically, only a small fraction of procedures advance from provisional status (Category III CPT codes) to fully reimbursed status (Category I CPT Codes)—among all procedures approved for Category III CPT codes between 2008 and 2014, only 29 percent were promoted after the five-year temporary period.====A second contribution of our paper is demonstrating the importance of securing a CPT code to the pace of diffusion of new medical procedures. This stands in stark contrast to new drugs, where no third-party “seal of approval” beyond the FDA is required for firms to begin earning revenue.==== We estimate that the AMA's decision to promote a CPT code from Category III to Category I causes a statistically significant, nearly nine-fold, increase in the use of these procedures by Medicare patients. The considerable lag between the promotion from Category III to Category I CPT codes represents a meaningful economic cost for innovators. To the extent that the procedure requires a patented medical device, this delay likely affects particularly valuable periods of market exclusivity. This is even more important in the medical device space, since patents for such devices are in general less binding than those for drugs (Halm and Gelijns 1991). As a result, leading device companies can usually obtain profits within only the first two years after product launch – a time period that is much shorter than for pharmaceuticals (Chatterji et al., 2008). The significant delay in reimbursement could sharply reduce the expected profits from medical device innovations.====Finally, we explore how innovators deal with limited property rights by examining the sponsors of applications for new CPT billing codes. Broadly speaking, applicants in our data are either firms, such as medical device manufacturers, or professional medical societies. We find that firms are more likely to apply for CPT codes representing new procedures that involve exclusive patented devices, while medical societies are more likely to apply for CPT codes for procedures that involve non-exclusive devices or no device. These findings suggest that when there is no clear path to appropriability, private firms are less likely to support the procedure and medical societies help resolve the commons problem.",The economics of medical procedure innovation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016762962100134X,31 December 2021,2021,Research Article,85.0

However, in ","The relationship between a patient and their doctor is widely regarded as a critical component in achieving good health outcomes (Institute of Medicine, 2001). Patient-provider relationships that are longitudinal and uninterrupted have been associated with promoting patient engagement in primary and preventive care (O’Malley, Mandelblatt, Gold, Cagney, Kerner, 1997, Saultz, Lochner, 2005) and minimizing risks of adverse health events, particularly in at-risk patients such as medically complex individuals and those with chronic conditions (Bayliss, Ellis, Shoup, Zeng, McQuillan, Steiner, 2015, Bindman, Grumbach, Osmond, Komaromy, Vranizan, Lurie, Billings, Stewart, 1995, Hussey, Schneider, Rudin, Fox, Lai, Pollack, 2014). However, in Medicaid managed care, which covers over 80% of Medicaid beneficiaries via state-contracted managed care plans (Mathematica Policy Research, 2019), institutional factors such as relatively limited provider networks and relatively high provider churn out of networks suggest disproportionately high rates of truncated patient-provider relationships (Ndumele et al., 2018). Moreover, there is sparse empirical evidence regarding the effects of these disruptions on patient utilization and wellbeing, which can be challenging for policymakers and providers who may need to consider interventions that trade off improving care delivery and access with disrupting existing relationships.====In this study, I estimate the causal effect of disruptions to the patient-provider relationship in Medicaid managed care by evaluating the effect of a provider’s exit from a Medicaid managed care network on their patients’ utilization and health outcomes. This approach is similar to several recent papers that have exploited changes in provider availability to the patient, like retirement or practice closures, to estimate the relationship between disrupted relationships and outcomes (Kwok, Sabety, Jena, Barnett, 2021, Simonsen, Skipper, Skipper, Thingholm, 2019, Zhang, 2018). However, these investigations have featured settings with a single insurance provider or health system, and where alternative providers are relatively accessible. By focusing on disruptions in Medicaid managed care networks, I aim to fill in the gap in our understanding of disrupted patient-provider relationships in more restrictive settings in which a provider’s exit from a plan may significantly limit a patient’s ability to access care.====I use a robust administrative Medicaid claims database, the Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX), to evaluate the impact of disruptions to the patient-provider relationship among Medicaid managed care enrollees after their primary provider exits their plan’s network. Because managed care organizations discourage the use of out-of-network providers, this exit likely represents a truncation of the relationship. I focus on the exit of a beneficiary’s “key provider,” a physician or advanced practice nurse of any specialty who is responsible for the plurality of the patient’s outpatient encounters in their first six months of enrollment. This definition is intended to flexibly identify the provider who is most important to the patient, and whose exit represents a significant emotional and/or clinical disruption to care.====I use an event study to estimate the effect of an exit on a patient’s utilization of primary, inpatient, and emergency care in the following year. To improve the precision of my estimates, and to recover a single summary number, I also estimate a pre-post model on the four quarters before and after the exit. I find an average 5% decrease in the number of patients who have a primary care visit following a provider’s exit, and no significant effect on hospitalizations or emergency care use.====I then explore heterogeneity in the treatment effects for a particularly vulnerable and high-risk subset of the population, patients with chronic conditions, for whom continuity in patient-provider relationships has been shown in associational studies to be particularly beneficial. Among this population, I find a slightly higher percentage point decrease in the probability of a primary care visit after a provider’s exit (4.2 versus 3.4 percentage points for chronic and non-chronic enrollees, respectively), and a significant increase of 2.1 percentage points in the probability of hospitalization following a provider’s exit, or an increase of approximately 50% of the pre-exit mean. Finally, I examine how these effects differ along a measure that is analogous to the degree of continuity a patient has with their provider. I find evidence of increasing effects of disruptions on outcomes of interest as continuity increases, consistent with prior associational observations.====This paper contributes to three areas of research. First, it builds on and extends existing literature on access to providers in Medicaid. Medicaid beneficiaries disproportionately experience disrupted care through a variety of different pathways in addition to provider exit, including an individual’s own churn into and out of Medicaid due to state eligibility thresholds. Banerjee et al. (2010) found that 43% of Medicaid enrollees changed coverage annually between 2000 and 2004, while Sommers et al. (2016) found that even after states expanded access to Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act, approximately 25% of Medicaid beneficiaries had changed coverage within twelve months of being surveyed. Ji et al. (2017) established a link between hospitalizations and gaps in Medicaid coverage through disenrollment among specific populations such as adults with major depression, though this study did not include the Medicaid managed care population. In addition to disruptions, Medicaid enrollees face disproportionate challenges in gaining access to providers. Evidence suggests that low reimbursement rates make providers reluctant to treat Medicaid enrollees in general (Decker, 2012), and that, relative to other insurers such as Medicare and private insurance, provider participation in Medicaid is significantly lower (Health Affairs Blog, 2019). Furthermore, there is evidence that not all providers reported as participating in a Medicaid managed care network will actually treat Medicaid enrollees (Office of Inspector General, 2014, Wallace, Lollo, Ndumele, 2020).====Second, this paper contributes to the ongoing discussion on the importance of the provider-patient relationship. Recent research in health economics, in which there is a growing interest in determining the relative contributions of patients and physicians on variations in healthcare utilization, has established a significant influence of primary care physicians’ (PCP) practice style on an individual patient’s spending and utilization, estimated from patients switching PCPs (Fadlon, Van Parys, 2020, Kwok). Additionally, researchers have found significant but mixed evidence of PCP exit on patient-level utilization. In Medicare, PCP retirement has been linked to short-term reductions in primary care utilization, with evidence of substitution towards urgent care and emergency departments (Kwok, Sabety, Jena, Barnett, 2021, Zhang, 2018). In Denmark, practice closures have been found to increase chronic condition diagnoses and slightly increase emergency department utilization (Simonsen et al., 2019). These studies, which significantly contribute to our understanding of disrupted care, cannot necessarily be externalized to Medicaid, which features more vulnerable beneficiaries and more restrictive provider networks.====Third, the paper adds to our understanding of the efficacy of interpersonal continuity in care. Interpersonal continuity of care describes a patient-provider relationship that is “characterized by loyalty and trust” (Saultz and Albedaiwi, 2004), and generally is cultivated over a sustained period of time. Prior research has established consistent associations between continuity in relationships and positive patient experience, including an increase in patient satisfaction with care (Fan, Burman, McDonell, Fihn, 2005, Saultz, Albedaiwi, 2004, Tingley, 2018) and patient trust in their physician (Mainous et al., 2001). Studies that examine vulnerable populations have reported correlations between continuity and often small decreased risks of inpatient and/or emergency department admissions among seniors (Bayliss, Ellis, Shoup, Zeng, McQuillan, Steiner, 2015, Nyweide, Anthony, Bynum, Strawderman, Weeks, Casalino, Fisher, 2013), veterans (Chaiyachati et al., 2014), Medicaid enrollees (Gill, Mainous, 1998, Gill, Mainous, Nsereko, 2000), and other vulnerable populations (Tingley, 2018). Turnover among PCPs has been linked to decreased patient satisfaction in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), but no significant effect on ambulatory care quality (Reddy et al., 2015). While these findings have contributed to our understanding of the importance of continuity in patient-provider relationships, there have been challenges in differentiating between association and causation of continuity and outcomes of interest (Saultz, Albedaiwi, 2004, Saultz, Lochner, 2005).====This paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, I briefly discuss relevant institutional details of Medicaid managed care. I provide details on my data sources and sample construction in Section 3, and discuss key measures relevant to the study in Section 4. I discuss my empirical approach in Section 5, and present results and robustness checks in Section 6.

On net, increasing ==== prices increases costs due to a behavioral response of larger quantities in addition to the mechanical increase.","In many developed countries, hospitals are reimbursed for treating patients based on diagnosis-related group (DRG) systems. In these systems, a hospital receives a fixed price based on the diagnoses and other characteristics of the patient, irrespective of the incurred cost. Such prices per patient in a DRG are typically set by a regulatory agency rather than through market forces. The effects of price-setting, as well as improvements to how prices are set, are therefore of immediate policy relevance.====A multitude of empirical studies has documented distortive incentive effects of prices for individual DRG. Oftentimes, such effects are plausibly nominal, in that they reflect changes in reporting, but not necessarily in treatment.==== However, comprehensive credible empirical evidence on price and income effects, covering the full spectrum of hospital services for a representative (patient) population and demonstrating real responses in who is treated, is limited.====In this paper, we estimate the price and income effects of prices for the full spectrum of hospital services in the German DRG system using quasi-random variation due to regulatory price setting. The German DRG system shares many similarities with other DRG systems such as the Medicare Prospective Payment System in the United States, such that our findings and empirical strategy may have broader applicability. Focusing on the German hospital system for our empirical analysis has two key advantages: First, we observe the universe of hospital admissions from 2005 to 2016. Observing all hospital admissions allows us to accurately measure income and to address substitution between hospitals, DRGs, and insurance types. Second, we exploit the institutional details of the German price setting mechanism for credible causal identification for all DRGs. Prices each year are set according to a two-year lag of average costs in the DRG. We argue that price and income shocks due to this two-year lag in costs are plausibly exogenous conditional on fine fixed effects. Empirically, we demonstrate that a ====-year lag of the same variation does not have a meaningful direct effect, such that the exclusion restriction is plausibly satisfied when using the ====-year lag as an instrument. In other words, we show that our instruments for income and prices, which are based on these historical cost estimates, do not cause substantive anticipatory effects. Our estimated effects therefore are plausibly identifying the effects of changes in income and prices, rather than direct effects of our instruments. We use a “simulated instrument” (cf. Currie, Gruber, 1996, Currie, Gruber, 1996) for income that measures the income a hospital department would realize under new prices if it treated patients with the same characteristics as in a previous year. The instrument isolates and uses only the exogenous variation in income due to the lag in price setting, rather than the endogenous variation due to changes in the number and composition of the patients treated in the hospital department. Since we observe yearly variation in prices for all DRGs and in income for all German hospitals in a panel of 12 years, we are able to also estimate heterogeneous elasticities for clinically defined super-groups of DRG based on the Clinical Classification System categories. We make these heterogeneous elasticity estimates available to other researchers for further use. Overall, our results show that not only changes in relative prices affect hospital behavior, but that increasing or decreasing the price level uniformly also leads to behavioral responses and affects real treatment decisions due to income effects.====We find a positive average price elasticity of quantity==== and a negative income elasticity. Specifically, we find that hospitals respond to a compensated 1% increase in the price of a single DRG by treating approximately 0.2% more such patients, reflecting the increased financial incentive to treat patients of this particular DRG. The income elasticity, in contrast, is negative: If a hospital department’s income increases by 1%, then – holding the price paid for a DRG fixed – it treats about 0.15% ==== patients of a given DRG. This effect is not driven by upcoding (cf. Silverman and Skinner, 2004) responses: The income elasticity remains largely unchanged if the income shock is due to clinically similar or dissimilar DRGs, which differ in their suitability for upcoding. This suggests that we measure real changes in who is treated rather than upcoding or minor changes in treatment.====We estimate a net positive effect on quantity when the price for all DRGs treated by a department increases. A 1% increase in all prices causes hospital departments to treat over ====% more patients. We find that this increase reflects a real increase in the number of patients. For this analysis, we aggregate patients at the department level, such that upcoding does not lead to increases in measured quantity. The effect cannot be explained by reallocation of patients between departments or hospitals: If the price level increases for hospital departments in a given hospital service area, then more patients from the corresponding zip codes are treated in hospitals. These results highlight the importance of calculating not only the mechanical effect of price changes but also analyzing behavioral responses to payment reforms.====While prices in DRG systems most directly incentivize treating more or fewer patients, we also find effects on measures of intensity and quality. Within a DRG, the average length of stay decreases as prices for other DRGs increase income. In addition to potential selection effects, this likely reflects stickiness of both the number of beds and personnel. In particular stickiness of personnel likely drives adverse effects of income shocks on quality. We find mild evidence suggesting that both the incidence of hospital-acquired conditions, such as hospital-acquired pneumonia and infections of surgical wounds, potentially leading to sepsis, and mortality rates increase as a response to changes in prices and income. When hospital departments treat more patients with the same number of staff, nurses and doctors likely have less time per patient, resulting in more preventable mistakes in care and deaths.====We contribute to the literature on hospital responses to price and income changes by estimating average and heterogeneous effects for the full spectrum of hospital services for a representative patient population. A substantial literature has documented responses to incentives for upcoding and intensifying service for specific DRGs (DiGiacomo et al., 2017, Einav, Finkelstein, Mahoney, 2018, Foo, Lee, Fong, 2017, Geruso, Layton, 2020, Gilman, 2000, Jürges, Köberlein, 2015, Papanicolas, McGuire, 2015, Silverman, Skinner, 2004, among others). Dafny (2005) uses price variation due to a 1988 policy reform that affected 43% of Medicare admissions across a wider range of DRGs. However, the population of Medicare beneficiaries differs systematically from the overall population, and represents only a part of hospital income. In our paper, we are able to study the effects of hospital income and the overall price level by observing the universe of hospital admissions rather than those that are part of any particular insurance system. Observing the universe of admissions is particularly important if income gains or losses from one part of admissions can be offset by price and quantity changes for other, unobserved, admissions (Dranove, Garthwaite, Ody, 2013, Feldman, Coulam, Dowd, 2015, Finkelstein, Hendren, Luttmer, 2019). Duggan, 2002, Duggan, 2000 and Baicker et al. (2013) highlight the importance of such reallocation and spillover effects between and within hospitals. Our estimates of the effects of increasing the overall price level are in the same direction as those reported by Clemens and Gottlieb (2014) for physician services, but quantitatively substantially smaller.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we provide a brief introduction to DRG systems and their implementation in Germany. We describe our data in Section 3. We discuss our empirical specifications that isolate the source of identifying quasi-random variation in Section 4. In Section 5, we present our empirical estimates and show robustness to alternative specifications and interpretations. In Section 6, we propose a sufficient statistics approach to the design of optimal DRG systems based on the estimated elasticities.

In this work, we contribute to this line of research by estimating the impact of the exemption of essential sectors from Italy’s national lockdown on reported infections and all-causes of death mortality.

First, although a number of studies assess the effects of Shelter-in-Place policies, which often encompass closure of non-essential sectors, no study, to our knowledge, has so far specifically isolated the impact on infections and mortality of lower constraints on economic activity.

Good health is a crucial dimension of human capital which contributes directly to own utility as well as economic performance (Grossman, 1972). Facing a severe negative health shock in the prime childbearing and/or parenting age not only poses challenges for the parent affected but may also have significant negative effects on children, partner, and the extended family.====While evidence of the intergenerational effects of a health shock on children's physical and mental health is accumulating (e.g., Visser et al., 2004), little attention has been drawn to children's academic achievements. Schooling is an important element of childhood and adolescence and forms the basis of children's accomplishments later in life (Heckman, 2007; Oreopoulos and Salvanes, 2011). There are different potential pathways through which a parent's illness can affect a child's school achievements. Adverse health events can impose pecuniary costs on the family, both directly, in terms of healthcare costs, and indirectly, in terms of income loss due to reduced work supply and productivity. As a result, a major health shock may, depending on a country's public system, affect the family's economic situation in the short and long term, including the ability to pay for schooling (Wagstaff, 2007). A parental health shock may also impose non-pecuniary costs on the children in terms of a direct health effect, an indirect investment effect and a psychological effect. Poor health may impact daily routines and reduce quantity as well as quality of the parents’ time contributed to their children (Buchbinder et al., 2009). Also, parents may spend less time on home production, such as supervision and care of their children, and spend more time on own health production (Jacobson, 2000). This manifests in periods where the parent is hospitalised, and thus away from home, but also throughout the period of illness as the ill parent needs to focus his or her (limited) energy on own recovery. In addition, it is likely that children living with an ill parent, especially if this is the mother, will undertake (more) domestic responsibilities and household roles and assist in caregiving taking away time from schoolwork (Dinku et al., 2018; Grabiak et al., 2007). Finally, the psychological consequences for the children have been shown to be large due to the emotional bond between parents and their children (Bowlby, 1982). Children may experience significant stress when confronted with the potential consequences of the illness and side effects of the treatments, and alterations in daily family routines can also be stressful (Osborn, 2007).====Several theories formulate returns to investments in intergenerational transmission, but the literature estimating the relationship between health shocks and the next generation's school outcomes is small, yet growing. With the exception of a few studies (Joergensen et al., 2018; Kristiansen, 2021; Le and Nguyen, 2017; Morefield, 2010), the majority of studies on non-fatal parental health shocks have been conducted in developing or low-income countries, and with focus on school enrolment and attendance (Alam, 2015; Bratti and Mendola, 2014; Dhanaraj, 2016; Dinku et al., 2018; Luca and Bloom, 2018; Mendolia et al., 2019; Sun and Yao, 2010; Woode, 2017). Although of interest, these findings cannot be generalised to higher income countries with well-established public sectors. Our study fills this gap in the literature. We aim to investigate the impact of a parental health shock on children's final grades in basic school and commencement and completion of secondary school in a Nordic setting.====Our study adds to the existing literature in five ways. First, we utilise the rich Danish registers to establish a cohort of children born between 1987 and 2000 and link the children to their parents at the individual level. The use of administrative data is a strength as we can use large sample sizes and health information is not self-reported. Moreover, we have a good measure of severity of illness based on detailed information on the types of cancer and probabilities of survival, which allow us to potentially limit the analysis to more exogenous types of cancer (e.g., those not depending on lifestyle). Every year approximately 42,000 Danish children (aged 0–18 years) experience a severe parental health shock, and around 2000 experience the death of a parent (Kehlet, 2015). We define a parental health shock as the first occurrence of a cancer. Such an event is likely to be unanticipated in the sense that the exact timing of the shock is unknown, it varies in severity, and it has a relatively high prevalence amongst people in the childbearing and parenting age range. The richness of the Danish registers allows us to tackle the concern of unobserved heterogeneity. For instance, parents with low education are more likely to have a poor lifestyle, engage in risky behaviour, have worse health, and at the same time invest less time and money in their children. In order to address this endogeneity problem, we match children affected by parental cancer with non-affected children one year before the cancer diagnosis. Thereby, we ensure that the school outcomes are likely associated with the health shock and not driven by other systematic characteristics of the exposed children.====Second, we look at heterogenous effects across family-related resilience factors. If health shocks have long-term negative spillover effects on children, it is relevant from a policy perspective to know whether the effects differ across child, parent, and family-related characteristics. Expanding our understanding of these effects may help to identify children and adolescents in high-risk groups who may benefit from appropriate support, thereby promoting educational and health equality. The child's age and gender may influence their accumulation of investments, their stage of cognitive development as well as their capacity to cope with grief (Diareme et al., 2007; Francesconi and Heckman, 2016). The ill parent's gender may determine time, money, and emotional investments, e.g., the mother may invest more time and emotions while the father may be the main provider (Del Boca et al., 2014; Guryan et al., 2008). The family's structure such as whether parents live together and whether they have living grandparents may affect the investment potential (Fallesen and Gähler, 2020; Greeff and Human, 2004). Moreover, it is well-established that parents’ socio-economic situation determines the amount and quality of parental investment (Björklund and Salvanes, 2011; Guryan et al., 2008). It is also likely that culture could modify or accentuate effects on school performance (Kao and Thompson, 2003). This study estimates the importance of each individual factor in turn.====Third, we contribute to the literature by minimising endogeneity problems related to mortality outcomes. Several studies have investigated the effects of death of a parent or sibling on academic achievements (Abdelnoor and Hollins, 2004; Ainsworth et al., 2005; Berg et al., 2014; Case and Ardington, 2006; Chen et al., 2009; Gertler et al., 2004a, 2004b; Høeg et al., 2019). However, the severity of the health shock, including death, may be endogenous, and potentially driven by unobservable personal traits. A major strength of this study is that we measure the severity of the health shock using cancer specific survival rates that are independent of stage at the cancer diagnosis.====Fourth, little attention has been given to understand the consequences of non-fatal health shocks. In this study we are able to measure the impact of health shocks amongst parental survivors and thus able to disentangle morbidity and mortality effects.====Fifth, we contribute to the literature by investigating the relationship between parental health and child development in a Nordic country characterised by a large public sector (including universal healthcare coverage and free education), generous welfare system and high gender equality. Thus, this institutional setting enables us to study the impact of parental health shock in a ‘best-case’ setting. The effect of non-fatal health shocks has previously been investigated in Denmark and Sweden (Chen et al., 2018; Joergensen et al., 2018; Kristiansen, 2021), likewise have the effects of parental deaths (Adda et al., 2011; Berg et al., 2014; Høeg et al., 2019). We extend this line of research by applying a design with greater identification power. We also provide new and more comprehensive empirical evidence by investigating severity and trajectory of illness, potential pathways, and heterogeneity.",Effects of parental health shocks on children's school achievements: A register-based population study,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629621001582,5 December 2021,2021,Research Article,89.0

Using detailed physician ownership information and a universe of Florida discharge records, we show novel evidence of hospital-physician integration foreclosure effects within outpatient procedure markets. Following hospital acquisition, physicians shift nearly 10% of their Medicare and commercially insured cases away from ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) to ==== and are up to 18% less likely to use an ASC at all. Altering physician choices over treatment setting can be in conflict with patient and payer cost, convenience, and quality preferences.","A long-running trend affecting hospitals is the shift from inpatient to outpatient sites of care. This shift more frequently allows patients to avoid a multiple day hospital course and instead receive a same-day discharge following their care. According to recent and national figures from the American Hospital Association, hospitals’ aggregate annual revenue of nearly $1 trillion is now almost evenly split between inpatient and outpatient hospital services (Bannow, 2019). The momentum away from inpatient-delivered care has implications for a wide variety of hospitals’ clinical business lines but has been especially pronounced for surgical procedures, which also account for roughly a third of all US health care expenditures (Muñoz et al., 2010). Outpatient delivery for surgery increasingly substituted for inpatient options starting in the early 1980s and has culminated in the majority of all hospital cases performed on an outpatient basis at this time.====Hospitals, however, are not solely responsible for the redirection toward outpatient settings for surgical as well as other types of procedural care, such as colonoscopies, endoscopies, and therapeutic injections. While inpatient care is limited to intra-industry competition (i.e., hospital-versus-hospital), outpatient procedures have rival industries competing for the same cases––namely, hospital outpatient departments (HOPDs) and free-standing ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs). ASCs are smaller and more specialized firms in comparison to hospitals and typically include direct ownership stakes by physicians. ASCs also try to differentiate themselves from competing hospitals by offering greater convenience and lower price points, which is widely believed to benefit commercially and publicly insured health care consumers (Paquette et al., 2008; Grisel and Arjmand, 2009; Hair et al., 2012; Munnich and Parente, 2014; Weber, 2014; Munnich and Parente, 2018; Aouad et al., 2019; Sood and Whaley, 2019).====There are currently more than 5000 ASCs in the US, and within the Medicare market alone, more than 6 million outpatient services have been annually performed in ASCs during recent years. In 2017, specifically, ASC facilities captured $4.6 billion in total Medicare payments and the rate of growth in ASC Medicare case volumes outpaced HOPDs for the first time (MedPAC, 2019). Unsurprisingly, hospitals are known to suffer weaker consumer demand and profitability when facing greater ASC competition (Bian and Morrisey, 2007; Courtemanche and Plotzke, 2010; Carey et al., 2011), and recent work demonstrates that hospitals may be forced to reduce their service prices in markets experiencing increased patient demand for ASCs (Whaley and Brown, 2018). These previous empirical findings, along with some industry perceptions, imply that market forces have at least partially disciplined hospitals through the threat and experience of losing profitable cases to ASCs. However, hospitals’ responses to business stealing by ASCs are not necessarily confined to consumer welfare promoting actions (e.g., offering more outpatient services, increasing quality, and/or accepting smaller markups). Instead, hospitals may seek to relax the degree of competition between these otherwise rival firms.====One plausible mechanism to do so is through regulation, such as Certificate of Need (CON) legislation, which can restrain the expansion of incumbent ASCs and/or erect barriers to entry for new ones (Hollenbeck et al., 2014; Whaley, 2018). However, lobbying for favorable (i.e., anticompetitive) state laws is costly, with uncertain time horizons and outcomes. Moreover, the likelihood of a slow policymaking process, even for advantageous changes, makes regulatory intervention a challenging and perhaps unprofitable strategic response for hospitals concerned with increasing ASC competition.====An alternative approach with potentially more immediate impact is simply to purchase the upstream supplier that both HOPDs and ASCs rely upon: physicians. Unlike many other markets where firms sell directly to consumers, patients access HOPDs and ASCs through physicians. Thus, HOPDs and ASCs need to attract physicians and their accompanying procedural cases in order to receive the facility component of payment attached to a given case. Physicians, on the other hand, face equivalent reimbursements when performing a surgery or procedure in either setting. Hospitals can either engage in costly effort to match ASCs in terms of physician-patient amenity and convenience offerings, or instead, make a lump-sum purchase in order to exercise more control over where the acquired physician's cases are performed. In other words, the ability of hospitals to vertically integrate with physicians creates a strategic opportunity to deny cases to competing ASCs and reallocate those cases to the owning hospitals’ HOPDs. Doing so avoids direct horizontal competition between hospitals and ASCs and is similar to “exclusive dealing” actions studied outside of health care markets (e.g., see Douglas Bernheim and Whinston, 1998).====Vertical integration between hospitals and physicians is of course not restricted to surgical care and has been on the rise in health care markets across the US (Gaynor et al., 2015; Nikpay et al., 2018; Post et al., 2018). Currently, over a third of all US physicians are employed by a hospital or work within a practice owned by a hospital or health system––an increase of 5 percentage points since 2012.==== Existing research indicates that this form of vertical integration is associated with higher care utilization, service prices, medical spending, and insurance premiums––with little evidence of efficiency or quality gains (Baker et al., 2014; Carlin et al., 2015; Neprash et al., 2015; Koch et al., 2017; Capps et al., 2018; Wendling and Wilson 2018; Post et al., 2018; Scheffler et al., 2018; Jung et al., 2019; Noel Short and Ho 2019). While these studies are documenting important and policy-relevant outcomes, foreclosure effects have received comparatively less empirical attention to date.====Previous economics research finds that vertical integration broadly (Hart et al., 1990; Ordover et al., 1990; Rasmusen et al., 1991; Segal and Whinston 2000) and as applied to hospital-physician alignment narrowly (Gaynor and Vogt 2000; Gaynor et al., 2015; Post et al., 2018), has the potential to exclude competitors from the market. Yet, we are aware of only three published studies that explicitly examine the role of vertical integration on physicians’ choice of care setting. Baker et al. (2016) use discrete choice estimation to show that physicians are much more likely to admit a given patient to their acquiring hospital and that these same hospitals tend to be higher cost, less convenient, and lower quality than nearby options––suggesting negative consumer welfare effects. Carlin et al. (2016) similarly find patients to be redirected toward acquiring hospitals for inpatient admissions and hospital-owned imaging facilities following three multispecialty physician practices being vertically integrated with two health systems in the Twin Cities Minnesota market. And finally, Koch et al. (2017) also observe some declines in physician inpatient claims in competing (non-owning) hospitals post-vertical integration for the 27 practices involved in their study; however, the predominant effect that the authors document is the redistribution of physician office-based claims to hospital outpatient-based care, rather than inpatient hospital switching. Each of these three studies raise key issues for regulatory and payment policy debates, especially as they pertain to hospital-to-hospital competition, but none of them speak to anticompetitive effects across industries where hospitals have private incentives to foreclose non-hospital rivals (e.g., ASCs).====In this paper, we investigate the presence and extent of anticompetitive effects from hospital acquisitions of physician practices in contested outpatient procedure markets. Using detailed physician practice ownership information from 2009 to 2015 linked to the universe of outpatient discharge records in Florida over this same period, we employ difference-in-differences (DD) and event study estimation to quantify how physicians’ treatment setting choices and related outcomes respond to being newly acquired by a local hospital or health system.====We find that physicians consistently integrated with hospitals are 65% less likely to use an ASC at all when compared to physicians that are never vertically integrated over our study period. Physicians that experience a hospital or health system acquisition within our analytic sample reduce the number of ASCs they rely upon by 13% and are 9% less likely to perform any procedures within an ASC. The negative ASC extensive margin effect we observe also grows over time, with an approximately 18% reduction four years out from the acquisition event. Consequently, physicians’ share of Medicare and commercially insured outpatient procedures taking place within ASCs falls abruptly by 8–9% once they are vertically integrated with a hospital. Although hospitals do not induce acquired physicians to perform more cases or more procedures per case, these physicians report charging considerably more for their outpatient services––approximately 29% over their baseline levels by the end of our study period. The increase in reported total charges is also most pronounced for traditional Medicare (i.e., fee-for-service) cases. There is little evidence that competing hospitals experience business stealing following a hospital's acquisition of a physician practice; instead, the foreclosure effects appear concentrated on the non-hospital rival industry.====Taken together, our findings offer a novel insight that augments the growing literature on the economic consequences of vertical integration between hospitals and physician practices. They also suggest risks of incentive misalignment between physicians and patients following the acquisition event. Vertical integration appears to distort physicians’ treatment setting choices by favoring HOPDs over ASCs, which may be in conflict with patient and payer preferences over cost, convenience, and quality dimensions. Subsequent weakening of competition can also negatively affect allocative efficiency in these markets. Antitrust authorities should bear in mind that hospitals’ strategic merger and acquisition (M&A) behavior can negatively impact firms outside of the hospital industry. These more diffuse market ramifications should therefore be a part of any regulatory scrutiny attached to a proposed hospital acquisition of a physician practice or group.",Treatment consolidation after vertical integration: Evidence from outpatient procedure markets,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629621001545,27 November 2021,2021,Research Article,90.0

To address this question, I leverage a discontinuity in legal access to alcohol at age 16 in Germany, a country with high consumption levels and a particularly early access regulation. Using detailed survey data and administrative crime records from 2005 to 2015, I detect considerable increases in drinking participation, frequency, and intensity at the legal cutoff along the middle and lower end of the distribution. These increases coincide with discrete jumps in criminal engagement under the influence of alcohol, mostly due to violent and property crimes. My findings suggest that changes in drinking intensity induce these crimes, implying a drinking-crime elasticity of 0.4 at age 16.","Worldwide, governments aim to moderate the onset of alcohol consumption and its unintended consequences through age-based access regulations. For the US, Canada, and Australia, existing research documents the effectiveness of a minimum legal drinking age in reducing harmful alcohol consumption (e.g. Carpenter, Dobkin, 2009, Carpenter, Dobkin, Warman, 2016, Lindo, Siminski, Yerokhin, 2016).==== While these studies restrict to young adults of full age, some European countries like Germany, Belgium, and Switzerland set a substantially lower age limit of 16 years, which is almost a quarter below the US restriction at age 21.====There is ample reason to believe that an early minimum legal drinking age (MLDA) of 16 years differs from higher cutoffs given important neuronal, cognitive, and behavioral adjustments at this age and throughout adolescence. Studies from neuroscience stress the vulnerability of the teenage brain which is undergoing major functional changes (Blakemore, 2012, Guerri, Pascual, 2010). The toxic effect of alcohol during adolescence does not only impair brain functioning in the short and long run (Ehlers, Criado, 2010, Squeglia, Jacobus, Tapert, 2014) but also predisposes future dependence (Guttmannova, Bailey, Hill, Lee, Hawkins, Woods, Catalano, 2011, Marshall, 2014). Compared to adults, teenagers around age 16 are also more likely to engage in risk or sensation seeking behavior (Steinberg, 2008). A heightened sensitivity to stimulating effects, on the one hand, and an immature cognitive-control system, on the other hand, make adolescents particularly prone to alcohol (Casey, Jones, Somerville, 2011, Miranda Jr., Monti, Ray, Treloar, Reynolds, Ramirez, Chun, Gwaltney, Justus, Tidey, et al., 2014).====The reinforcing impact of alcohol on teenage imprudence and shortsightedness tends to aggravate adverse outcomes. A costly outcome often committed by adolescents and commonly linked to drinking is crime. Within the EU, the estimated burden of consumption-induced offenses amounts € 33 billion annually, which adds substantially to the overall social costs associated with alcohol (WHO, 2009). While causal estimates on the drinking-crime relationship stem primarily form the US MLDA of 21, less is known about lower cutoffs. But evidence on younger ages is important, since an early crime onset is associated with a higher offending frequency and a longer criminal career (Blokland and Nieuwbeerta, 2010). Understanding how early access to alcohol pushes teenagers into crime is thus extremely relevant.====The effectiveness of an early access regulation at age 16 is a priori unclear. Considering adolescents’ development, it is likely to observe substantial increases in consumption and alcohol-induced crime once it is legal to drink. But European countries with a MLDA of 16 also constitute high-consumption environments where alcohol is broadly available and socially accepted.==== On the one hand, this could work against compliance with the regulation. On the other hand, it could induce teenagers at the margin to start and increase drinking once they are legally entitled. It is thus an empirical question to determine the overall impact.====In this study, I investigate the German MLDA of 16 years and its impact on teenage alcohol consumption and criminal engagement using detailed individual survey data and administrative crime records over the years 2005 to 2015. I employ a regression discontinuity design (RD) and leverage the ==== birthday when teenagers in Germany are legally allowed to access fermented alcohol, that is beer, wine and sparkling wine.==== I thus draw on an age cutoff which is among the lowest in the world (WHO, 2016b).====In a first step of the analysis, I evaluate the impact of the access regulation at age 16 on different dimensions of alcohol consumption looking at potential changes in drinking participation, drinking frequency, and drinking intensity at age 16. I also investigate the impact of the access regulation along the whole distribution of drinking frequency and drinking intensity (Carpenter et al., 2016), drawing on very recent consumption questions that allow a clear distinction between both dimensions. This is crucial since alcohol consumption and its pathway on adverse outcomes might neither evolve linearly nor similarly for both types of drinking. In a second step, I examine the criminal engagement of teenagers around the legal cutoff along different types of offenses. The information on whether an individual acted under the influence allows a separate analysis of drunk and sober offenders. In a third step, I investigate gender-specific differences and other heterogeneities to learn more about the mechanisms of alcohol control. The daily structure of the crime records and the option to track individuals over time provide useful information to trace out potential pathways.====My results reveal substantial increases in teenage drinking at age 16, which coincide with discrete jumps in criminal engagement under the influence of alcohol, mostly due to violent crimes (i.e. light and aggravated assaults) and property crimes (i.e. vandalism and theft). These findings prove robust to a broad set of falsification checks and a conservative randomization-based inference approach. Along all dimensions, males react more but effects also appear for females. Besides, crime increases under the influence appear mostly at the weekend, i.e. outside the structured school day that teenagers at age 16 usually attend in Germany. The shift in alcohol induced crimes is also entirely driven by first-time offenses. That is, individuals at the margin of committing an alcohol-induced offense do so for the first time at age 16 by exceeding their critical blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level to become criminal. This finding suggests intensity shifts in teenage drinking as the underlying pathway to more crime. Taken together, a one percent increase of the drinking intensity at age 16 implies a 0.4 percent increase of crimes committed under the influence of alcohol.====My analysis contributes to recent RD studies on the impact of a MLDA on crime (Carpenter, Dobkin, 2015, Hansen, Waddell, 2018) in two important ways: First, I look at a substantially lower cutoff regulation of 16 years. Compared to the US access regulation at age 21 and undergoing changes during adolescence, this age difference is huge. A high teenage sensitivity to alcohol’s stimulating effect makes adolescents at age 16 particularly prone to increase consumption and alcohol-induced misconduct once it is legal to drink. Second, I study a setting where alcohol is broadly available and socially accepted. In European countries with a low MLDA of 16 years, average consumption levels are almost 30 percent above the US and thus highest in the world (WHO, 2010). An easier access to alcohol in high consumption settings might offset the effectiveness of an early access regulation but could also facilitate the onset or increases in consumption and alcohol-induced crimes by indecisive teenagers. But evidence on the drinking-crime relationship within European countries is scarce and only recently, first studies appeared which analyze the impact of access restrictions in Europe on hospitalization (Ahammer, Bauernschuster, Halla, Lachenmaier, Datta Gupta, Nilsson). Interestingly, my analysis reveals increases in alcohol-induced violent and property crimes that are qualitatively equivalent but on average smaller than the estimates documented by Carpenter and Dobkin (2015) and Hansen and Waddell (2018) on the US. In light of similar consumption patterns at the respective age restrictions and a particular stimulating impact of alcohol on teenage imprudence, this finding might be unexpected. While not overinterpreting, it might suggest a mitigating effect of high-consumption settings where cultural knowledge about alcohol is more prevalent. Yet, persistent increases in drinking and crime at an early cutoff like the German MLDA are particular problematic considering the development of important neuronal adjustments and behavioral habits at this age. The implications of my analysis may thus differ from previous studies of higher age restrictions.====This paper also contributes to a better understanding of the mechanisms through which MLDA regulations operate by looking at important heterogeneities. The detailed crime data provide policy-relevant insights while evaluating the occurrence of criminal activities over the course of the week and across gender. By differentiating crimes not only by previous engagement (Hansen and Waddell, 2018) but also whether the offender acted under the influence of alcohol, I link the analysis of drinking and crime. I thereby gain further insights on potential mechanisms of the drinking-crime relationship. Besides, I learn about the types of offenders who are pushed into alcohol-induced misconduct. From a life-course criminology perspective, these insights are important. Finally, my analysis advances the work of Kamalow and Siedler (2019) on the German MLDA by systematically evaluating the different dimensions of alcohol consumption and respective discontinuities along the entire drinking distribution. Overall, my findings thus provide novel insights on relevant margins of the drinking-crime relationship, which are important to consider when constructing effective interventions.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the legal setup that regulates teenage alcohol consumption in Germany. Section 3 presents the data and the empirical strategy. Section 4 covers the results of the consumption and crime analysis, robustness checks, and evidence on potential mechanisms. Section 5 discusses my findings in light of pre-existing studies.

Information on the effectiveness and safety of drugs is an important determinant of appropriate prescribing and utilization. While the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires rigorous evaluation before a drug can enter the market, information can evolve after FDA approval as adverse events and side effects are observed, recorded, and studied. This post-approval information is typically communicated via academic journal publications and various FDA regulatory actions. While a large literature demonstrates that post-approval information shocks have important impacts on doctor practice patterns and consumer utilization of prescription drugs, much less is known about how that information is disseminated or the strategic responses of firms to such shocks.====We examine how pharmaceutical firm marketing responds to an FDA regulatory decision that represents a positive information shock about drug safety, in the context of the smoking cessation drug Chantix. Specifically, we examine the effects of the FDA's September 2016 decision to remove the black box warning from the Chantix label. A black box warning is placed on a drug if there is the potential for serious adverse or life-threatening side effects. It is the strongest warning the FDA issues and is included prominently on the drug's label or packaging. The Chantix black box warning was added in July 2009, after concerns emerged about serious neuropsychiatric side effects; the decision to remove it followed completion of a large randomized trial that demonstrated these risks were lower than previously believed. Notably, the removal of such warnings is not uncommon; since 2016, the FDA has removed at least one black box warning each year.====A priori, it is unclear how a pharmaceutical firm's marketing efforts will change in response to a positive information shock, such as the removal of a black box warning. The firm may increase their efforts, particularly in the short-run, to disseminate the updated safety information to physicians and patients. Marketing efforts could also rise if the returns to promotion increase in the absence of the boxed warning. Alternatively, if pre-existing marketing efforts were aimed at counteracting the negative information associated with the boxed warning, promotional activities may decline with the warning removal. We examine these marketing responses in a context of great importance, as smoking is one of the leading causes of preventable disease and death in the US (US DHHS, 2020).====We focus on two types of pharmaceutical marketing: detailing in the form of monetary or in-kind payments to physicians (e.g., meal provision), typically made during a visit to the provider's office, and direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA). These represent two key channels through which pharmaceutical firms reach providers and patients, each accounting for about 20 percent of medical marketing expenditure in the United States in 2016 (Schwartz and Woloshin, 2019).==== Moreover, these channels are important to study as their regulation has increasingly been the focus of policymakers, due to concerns that they cause inappropriate prescribing.====To estimate the effects of the Chantix black box warning removal on pharmaceutical marketing efforts, we adopt two distinct identification strategies. First, using data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Open Payments database, we estimate the effects on physician detailing payments using difference-in-differences models that leverage pre-existing spatial variation in the latent demand for smoking cessation treatments. That is, we compare changes in detailing in areas with little to no potential demand for the drug to changes in places with high potential demand. This strategy is motivated by evidence that sales representatives’ time and travel is costly; therefore, data-driven pharmaceutical firms strategically target detailing toward more profitable markets with higher potential demand (Mizik and Jacobson, 2004; Fugh-Berman and Ahar, 2007; Datta and Dave, 2017; Fernandez and Zejcirovic, 2018). We proxy for latent demand with county-level adult smoking rates prior to the boxed warning removal, and we focus on detailing to providers specializing in family or internal medicine, as they receive the vast majority (94 percent) of Chantix-related detailing payments.====The removal of the black box warning significantly increased Chantix-related physician detailing. Our results imply that the removal increased the probability of receiving any Chantix-related payments in a given quarter by 0.7 percentage points for physicians practicing in counties with above median smoking rates, relative to those in below median smoking rate counties.==== This represents a 20 percent increase relative to the pre-warning-removal mean. Similarly, the dollar amount and the number of Chantix-related payments increased by 24 to 25 percent for physicians practicing in above median relative to below median smoking rate counties.====To estimate the effects on DTCA, we implement an alternative identification strategy that leverages the fact that the FDA regulatory action was specific to smoking cessation drugs, and therefore, the marketing of drugs in other classes should be unaffected. We use the Kantar Media Ad$pender database and estimate difference-in-differences models, comparing changes in Chantix-related television advertising expenditures to changes for non-Pfizer branded drugs in other unaffected classes. This empirical strategy is motivated by the fact that nearly all (99 percent) of Chantix television DTCA is at the national level as opposed to the local spot market level, a phenomena common to many drugs given the cost structure of TV ads (Peter J Solomon Company, 2017; Geving, 2020). We find quarterly Chantix national TV advertising expenditures increased by about $20 million after the FDA voted to remove the boxed warning, a 71 percent increase relative to Chantix's pre-warning-removal average. Taken together, our results imply that Chantix-related marketing increased substantially following the boxed warning removal.====Our paper makes several important contributions. First, we provide novel evidence on how pharmaceutical firm marketing responds to positive information shocks resulting from FDA regulatory action. The existing literature on drug firms’ responses to FDA regulatory decisions has primarily focused on ==== shocks (e.g., Conti et al., 2011; Macher and Wade, 2013; Krieger et al., 2018),==== and the effects of negative and positive information shocks need not be symmetric. The literature examining positive information shocks has focused on clinical studies and their impact on detailing (Azoulay, 2002; Ching and Ishihara, 2010; Sood et al., 2014; Shapiro, 2018). We complement and extend this work by examining a different positive information shock (i.e., the removal of a black box warning), and by additionally considering impacts on DTCA expenditures.====Our study also complements the literature on ==== and ==== behavior following information shocks. This literature consistently shows that prescribing and drug utilization respond to FDA regulatory action.==== However, evidence on the mechanisms driving information dissemination and the prescribing and utilization responses is sparse (Chressanthis et al., 2012). Our findings, in conjunction with the adjacent literature showing that detailing and DTCA affect physician and consumer behavior (e.g., Mizik and Jacobson, 2004; Datta and Dave, 2017; Bergman, 2018, Fernandez and Zejcirovic, 2018, Shapiro, 2018, Shapiro, 2021, Agha and Zeltzer, 2019, Grennan et al., 2021, Carey et al., 2021), suggest the firm's marketing response may be a crucial factor underlying drug utilization changes following information shocks. Given the increasing calls for regulation of pharmaceutical marketing, understanding its role in information dissemination is particularly timely and important.====We also contribute to the small but growing literature that exploits natural experiments to quantify how various factors or policies impact pharmaceutical firm promotion (e.g., Lakdawalla et al., 2013, Alpert et al., 2018, Alpert et al., 2019, Fernandez and Zejcirovic, 2018, Nguyen et al., 2019, Sinkinson and Starc, 2019).==== Pharmaceutical firm expenditures on marketing have grown rapidly over the past several decades, increasing from about $17 billion (in real 2016 dollars) in 1997 to almost $27 billion in 2016 (Schwartz and Woloshin, 2019), and data from 2013 show that for 9 of the 10 largest pharmaceutical companies, expenditures on marketing exceeded expenditures on research and development (Swanson, 2015). In spite of the substantial and growing role of marketing in pharmaceutical firm budgets, the determinants of these expenditures are not well understood.====Furthermore, we study these effects for a drug that is important and policy-relevant in its own right. Chantix is the most effective smoking cessation medication relative to common alternatives like nicotine replacement therapy and bupropion (Cahill et al., 2013) and smoking is one of the leading causes of preventable disease, disability, and death in the US (US DHHS, 2020). In addition, during our sample period, Chantix faces limited competition as it still enjoys patent exclusivity, and Zyban, the main branded prescription alternative, is off patent and engages in essentially no detailing or DTCA.==== Thus, we provide a clean estimate of Pfizer's response to the information shock, rather than an estimate that also reflects a response to competitors’ actions.====Finally, our use of variation in latent demand to identify the effects of new information on physician detailing is a novel identification strategy in this literature.==== By exploiting pre-existing spatial variation in smoking rates, we do not rely on treatment intensity measures constructed at the provider-level, which would suffer from the concern that drug firms endogenously target providers. This strategy could be promising for estimating the impact of information shocks, or policies more generally, on promotional efforts in other contexts.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides background on smoking cessation products, pharmaceutical detailing, and DTCA.

It is natural to study these two separate research questions together, as a model that addresses question (1) is itself included within a more complex model that addresses question (2). Our analysis is based on three datasets that were gathered over multiple decades and that describe a single sample of US twins. The initial dataset is the Minnesota Twin Registry (MTR). Its follow-up survey, conducted by economists, is the Socioeconomic Survey of Twins (SST). We add to these existing datasets our own, newly-collected, individual mortality data.====The collection of the MTR data began in 1983 in order to identify and study twins born in Minnesota. The SST survey followed up with a subsample of the initial MTR participants. We analyze same-sex twin pairs, in which both twins participated in the SST and both provided information about their education levels. Our estimation sample contains 1,233 twin pairs born between 1936 and 1955. We match the data from the SST to the data from the MTR. We then match the resulting MTR-SST data to new data on mortality, which we gathered from the Social Security Death Master File, the National Death Index, and contact with surviving relatives.====We apply a linear probability model to within-pair differences between identical twins, which allows us to estimate the extent to which a twin with more years of education can be expected to outlive their less educated twin. From this estimate we are able to draw conclusions about the effect of education on longevity. This within-twin-pair approach leverages the common family and genetic background shared by identical twins. We use the same method to study effects of education on health and health behaviors.====To find whether parents use educational investments to compensate for or reinforce differences between their children in endowments that predict health (hereafter referred to as “health endowments”) we adopt the same method initially proposed by Behrman et al. (1994) for studying endowments that predict earnings, called “earnings endowments.” For identification, we rely on the presence of identical genes in monozygotic (MZ, or “identical”) twins, genetic variation in dizygotic (DZ, or “fraternal”) twins, and shared family background for all observed twin pairs. In addition, we reanalyze results by Behrman et al. (1994) regarding earnings endowments using direct measures of wages and earnings from SST (the original paper used earnings imputed from occupations reported in MTR).====We account for a number of econometric issues. By using twin fixed effects we not only control for major confounders, but also control for possible selection biases, including selective attrition (Behrman, Rosenzweig, Taubman, 1994, Heckman, MaCurdy, 1980, Pitt, Rosenzweig, 1990). To account for measurement error in schooling, we use the well-established Ashenfelter and Krueger (1994) method, which takes advantage of each twin’s report about their own education and the education of the other twin. Finally, we control for expected major confounders that could differ across twins: birth weight and disabling injury.====The causal effect of education on health and longevity, our first empirical research question, is still debated in the literature. As we discuss in Section 2.1, many authors support the causal effect, while many others argue against it. Because effects of education on health and longevity likely differ from country to country, the most relevant results for our paper to compare to are results based on US datasets. However, the popular compulsory schooling law instrumental variable is weak for the US (Galama et al., 2018). A sound alternative estimator is the twin fixed effect. However, a small number of papers based on existing US twin datasets reach conflicting conclusions. The results we present here, based on well-established methods and new high-quality data, support the claim that education has a causal effect on health and health behaviors. In addition, to our knowledge we are the first to demonstrate a causal effect of education on longevity by applying twin-first-difference methodology to US data.====Our second research question, whether parents of multiple children tend to reinforce or compensate for differences in their children’s endowments, is also empirical, as both results are theoretically possible. The question is controversial, as for every possible result—whether it be compensation, reinforcement, both effects, or neither effect—there exists a group of papers that supports it, as summarized in Almond and Mazumder (2013). This great variation in literature results is likely driven by differences in the type of endowment (e.g., skill vs. health endowment), type of investment (e.g., education vs. health investment), type of population (e.g., developed vs. developing country), and type of identification method, among other differences. We discuss the literature in Section 2.2 while taking these differences into account. We contribute to this literature by adding unique data and measures of latent health endowments that are new in this literature.====We argue that the literature is biased towards the finding that parents typically reinforce the differences in their children’s endowments. Hence, if the true prevailing behavior is compensation, it can be misclassified in a statistical analysis as either reinforcement or neutral behavior. We are aware of two sources of bias, both going in the same direction. One source of bias is the failure to account for a child’s capacity to make their own decisions—beyond those decisions made by their parents on the child’s behalf—about the total investments in them. For instance, a sicker child may end up with lower level of education not only because their parents may choose to reallocate educational investments to their healthier child, but also because the sicker child has reduced capabilities and economic incentives to study. Another source of bias comes from failing to account for the effect of endowment on investment costs: if a less favorable endowment leads to increased investment costs, the resulting parental choice may look like reinforcement despite parental preference for compensation other things kept equal (Sanz-de Galdeano, Terskaya, Terskaya). To the best of our knowledge, the rest of the literature does not address these types of bias (e.g., Almond and Mazumder, 2013). We return to these types of bias in Section 4.3.====Estimated parameters of our main health-formation model are nominally consistent with parental compensation behavior, that is, investing in additional education for the child with poorer health endowment. Our reanalysis of results by Behrman et al. (1994) for earnings endowments nominally suggests that parents are neutral with respect to differences in earnings endowments. When taking the expected bias into account, we can still claim the compensation result for health endowments, as this result is obtained ==== the bias. In contrast, our reanalysis for earnings endowments does not support reinforcement even before taking the bias into account. After taking the bias into account, these results do not rule out a possible compensation.","Health endowments, schooling allocation in the family, and longevity: Evidence from US twins",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629621001399,16 November 2021,2021,Research Article,94.0

Prenatal tests are offered in the first trimester of pregnancy in many high-income countries to identify possible genetic disorders, for example, Down syndrome and Edwards’ syndrome, in the fetus (Boyd et al., 2008; Palomaki et al., 2006; Grimes and Schulz 2002). Two different types of tests are typically available. Noninvasive ==== tests, such as combined or integrated prenatal screening tests, are generally inexpensive and allow doctors to estimate the risk of genetic disorders. Invasive ==== tests are more expensive but permit doctors to diagnose the presence of chromosomal anomalies with greater accuracy through a genetic map of the fetus.====When combined, these tests can detect congenital anomalies that affect around 0.3 to 0.5 percent of newborns. Congenital anomalies are a leading cause of infant mortality, morbidity, and long-term disability (EUROCAT 2010). Accuracy, safety, and the mother's peace of mind are often cited as the benefits of the prenatal tests (e.g., Dormandy et al., 2005). Types of genetic screening programs, as well as medical recommendations and guidelines, are heterogeneous across countries. At the beginning of the 2000s, many countries implemented reforms to harmonize policies at the national and international levels, but the process remains ongoing (World Health Organization 2016).====The literature (e.g., Crombag et al., 2014) and international health organizations (EUROCAT 2010) highlight the variability in take-up rates for prenatal tests across and within countries as a critical issue. Many factors explain such variability: differences in service delivery and health systems, socioeconomic traits and cultural components of the population, and market failures (e.g., underestimation of benefits and positive externalities associated with the use of prenatal care). Policymakers justify introducing free screening programs to the underserved by pointing to the perceived suboptimal take-up of screening tests within some institutional settings (Currie 2006; Shurtz et al., 2016).====In this study, we apply quasi-experimental methods to investigate whether eliminating co-payments for noninvasive ==== tests is an effective policy to increase the take-up of prenatal testing. We use a regression discontinuity design (RDD) to quantify the effect of a government policy in a large region in Italy (Piedmont) that eliminated co-payments for noninvasive prenatal screening tests. Identification of the treatment effects is determined by a discontinuity in women's eligibility for obtaining free prenatal screening tests before and after the policy cutoff date in October 2009. We, therefore, use time as our running variable and compare women over a narrow time window before and after the policy is introduced.====This paper addresses three research questions. First, we test the extent to which eliminating co-payments for noninvasive tests increases their utilization and whether, in turn, this reduces the use of costlier and riskier invasive tests (a substitution effect). Second, we investigate heterogeneity in the effect across different groups, particularly women from low socioeconomic status. Although some noninvasive prenatal screening tests are inexpensive, even a relatively small co-payment can be a barrier and discourage women from disadvantaged groups from undergoing the tests. We, therefore, investigate whether the elimination of the co-payment not only increases use but also whether it reduces inequalities in access to prenatal care. Third, the lack of prenatal care is associated with poor birth outcomes, such as low birth weight, preterm birth, and infant mortality (Woodhouse et al., 2014; Currie and Rossin-Slater 2015; Corman et al., 2018), as well as worse health of mothers (Conway and Kutinova, 2006). Thus, we investigate whether an increase in prenatal tests affects mothers’ health behaviors and newborn health as a result of additional visits, contacts, and interactions with midwives and doctors.====We provide evidence on these questions by considering the interesting case of Italy. Regions in Italy have a high degree of autonomy in legislating healthcare policies, including prenatal and maternal care. Prenatal tests for the diagnosis of Down syndrome and other chromosomal disorders have been available since 2001 for all Italian women, including those covered by the Regional Health Service of the Piedmont Region.==== The regional co-payment scheme required women to contribute to the cost of these tests. The co-payment for noninvasive screening tests was in the range of €27–€54, depending on the specific test provided (the combined test, the triple test, or the integrated test). The co-payment was in the €160–200 range for invasive diagnostic tests, depending on the specific test provided (chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis) and several maternal characteristics.====In 2009, the regional government of Piedmont eliminated the co-payment for noninvasive screening tests, making the noninvasive tests available to all women free of charge. There was no change to the co-payment for invasive diagnostic prenatal tests. The aim of the policy was twofold.====First, public authorities wanted to improve the ==== of prenatal testing by increasing the take-up of noninvasive screening tests (and, as a result, reducing the inappropriate use of invasive diagnostic tests). According to medical guidelines, noninvasive screening tests allow women with a high (low) risk of delivering an infant with congenital anomalies to be identified. Women identified as “low risk” do not require further testing; this reduces the need for invasive diagnostic tests and the number of miscarriages related to these invasive tests. On the contrary, women identified as “high risk” (i.e., those with a positive screening test) can obtain the invasive diagnostic tests for free. Increasing take-up as a result of the policy is expected to improve detection of congenital anomalies up to about 90 percent since noninvasive tests are more effective than a simple alternative screening method based on a fixed threshold rule identifying all pregnant women aged 35 years or over as “high risk.”==== In addition, recent developments make noninvasive tests almost as reliable as invasive tests.==== Increasing take-up will bring about a relatively minor increase in direct costs (i.e., those associated with the provision of prenatal tests by the national health system) and a reduction in indirect costs (i.e., those associated with invasive tests, like miscarriages) since noninvasive tests are less costly and less risky than the more-invasive diagnostic tests.====Second, public authorities aimed to improve ==== in prenatal testing by mitigating disparities in access to prenatal tests. Observed take-up rates were meager among more deprived areas within the region and lower socioeconomic groups.====The eligibility rules justify our RDD approach to identifying the effects of the co-payment reform. First, after the policy became effective on October 1, 2009, all pregnant women were automatically eligible. Second, the initial general policy was announced in May 2008. Still, the detailed rules about the policy were made public only in August 2009, which almost coincided with the start of the policy on October 1, 2009. The timing of the regulatory acts prevents any strategic behavior of women around the policy change date. Third, we can reasonably rule out any manipulation of the pregnancy decision as a strategic reaction to eliminating the co-payment because the price of prenatal tests represents a negligible portion of the costs associated with having a child. The decision to have a child involves many other factors, including the costs of raising a child, and eliminating the co-payment should not affect the number of women becoming pregnant after the policy implementation.====The policy elements generate a discontinuity in the treatment assignment between women who are tested before and after the policy cutoff date. We exploit this discontinuity in eligibility to obtain an exogenous variation in participation. We, therefore, use time as our running variable, an approach that many recent papers adopted in different empirical settings, e.g., housing (Fetter 2013; Moulton et al., 2018), energy consumption (Ito 2015), health (Halla et al., 2016; Aguilara et al., 2021), pollution abatement (Li et al., 2020), drug consumption (Hansen et al., 2020), and domestic violence (Carr and Packham 2021). This approach exploits the timing of the policy change to causally estimate its effects, under the key identifying assumption that there are no changes in the outcome variable other than those caused by the policy itself. Finally, we use a relatively narrow window of 52 weeks before and after the cutoff date to avoid concerns of secular trends in prenatal testing. We also check that our results are robust to an even narrower (or broader) window. We finally provide several falsification tests using as alternative cutoff dates both the same month but in different years, before and after 2009, and different months in 2009. We show no evidence of a change in testing behavior in these alternative dates, ruling out any potential anticipation effects.====Our key results are as follows. First, in our baseline specification, we find that eliminating the co-payment increases the probability that a woman undergoes any prenatal tests by 6.6 percentage points. Women's increased use in the screening test, by 5.5 percentage points, mainly drives the results. The average pre-policy rate of women taking only the noninvasive screening test was 63 percent; the policy increased the take-up rate for screening tests by 8.7 percent. However, we do not observe any substitution effects because eliminating the co-payment did not reduce the take-up rate of the costlier invasive diagnostic tests. This result is driven mainly by the behavior of women older than 35 years at conception. Before the elimination of the co-payment, these women could already access free diagnostic tests based on a legislative provision that considered them to be at high risk of congenital disorders. After the co-payments were eliminated for all women, women older than 35 could also obtain screening tests free of charge. However, these women have not changed their behavior after the policy change; they are still likely to skip the screening tests and undergo invasive diagnostic tests. Hence, the reduction in the proportion of women who do not undergo any test is due entirely to the increase in the proportion of women who undergo noninvasive screening tests. If it takes time for the effects of the reform to entirely accrue, our RDD approach provides a conservative estimate of the full effect of the policy.====Second, we find heterogeneity in the impact of the reform across women with different socioeconomic statuses. The elimination of the co-payment increased the take-up rate, especially for women 25–34 years old, those born abroad, those who reside in metropolitan areas, and those with an intermediate level of education.====Third, accounting for self-selection into prenatal care, we assess whether screening tests affect the health outcomes of mothers and newborns. Having a prenatal test early in the pregnancy increases the number of visits and contacts with midwives and doctors, which in turn increases the opportunity for clinicians to advise on lifestyle and potentially harmful effects of unhealthy behaviors that may impact newborns’ health outcomes (Raatikainen et al., 2007; Harris et al., 2012; Metcalfe et al., 2013). After ruling out any increase in the number of pregnancy terminations following the policy, we use the discontinuity in eligibility of free prenatal screening tests triggered by the policy as an instrumental variable for utilization. However, the IV results show a reduction in mothers’ weight gain and hospital admissions during pregnancy triggered by prenatal testing, which are only marginally statistically significant. We do not find any effect of prenatal screening tests on the health status of newborns at delivery, which is consistent with the results on maternal behavior.====Prenatal tests have been the focus of economic studies. Fajnzylber et al. (2010) develop and calibrate a model of amniocentesis choice and find that the amniocentesis take-up rate should decrease (instead of increase) with age, once all the risk factors are considered (e.g., the risk of an affected child, the risk of miscarriage associated with amniocentesis, as well as the risk of a decline in fertility with age). Seror (2008) uses an interview-based survey to assess different models of amniocentesis choice. Gajdos et al. (2016) exploit French amniocentesis regulations to offer a measure of the disutility associated with a child with Down syndrome.====The studies by Garrouste et al. (2011) and Shurtz et al. (2016) are the closest to our work. They investigate the effect of public policies aimed at subsidizing diagnostic prenatal tests (amniocentesis) in France and Israel, respectively. Both studies find that utilization rates rise sharply when women are eligible for full reimbursements.====Our contribution differs from previous studies in three key dimensions. First, our main focus is on noninvasive prenatal screening tests. To our knowledge, no other economics paper has studied this type of prenatal test. Screening tests are not conclusive, but they are less expensive and widely used across different medical specialties (e.g., cholesterol measurement tests, Pap tests, fecal occult blood tests, mammograms) to identify subpopulations that may require additional care.==== Our study contributes to identifying the effects of the subsidization of prenatal screening tests on take-up rates and, in turn, on mother and newborn health. Second, we test for substitution effects between screening and diagnostic tests, which none of the preceding papers has investigated. Third, the institutional setting is different, which allows us to compare findings across health systems.====We also contribute to the literature on prenatal care and its short-run effects on the health of mothers and children. Most of the existing literature on prenatal care focuses on children's health (see Corman et al., 2018 for a recent survey). Only a few papers explore, within a causal setting, the beneficial effects of prenatal care on health during pregnancy (e.g., Conway and Kutinova 2006; Yan 2017). Our contribution closes this gap in the existing literature by estimating the causal effects of prenatal screening tests on the health of both mothers and children.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows.

Continuity of care covers both information continuity, management continuity (consistency of patient care), and interpersonal continuity (the patient‒provider relationship); see Haggerty et al. (2003). Continuity of care is a commonly-accepted principle of quality health care delivery and is thought to be especially important in primary care because primary care providers (PCPs), or family doctors, are usually the first to see patients and because they serve as gatekeepers for specialized medical treatment and hospital care. Empirical work on this issue is important for the purpose of correctly assessing the consequence of PCP-patient discontinuities that are necessarily arising because of physician retirements,==== and also potentially for the purpose of informing health care policy.====Our paper provides extensive evidence concerning the consequences for patients of re-matching from one PCP to another provider. In particular, we use population-level administrative Danish data covering the period 1998‒2015 to study the consequences of discontinuities in PCP care through practice closures. Using an event study design, comparing those who experience a practice closure to those who only experience a practice closure later, we ask, first of all, what are the consequences of such practice closures, if any, for patient health care utilization? And, secondly, to what extent are the observed effects the result of the discontinuity itself ==== the result of the patient being matched to a new PCP whose practice style differs from the previous PCP?====Our analyses deliver two sets of results: First, we show that PCP re-matches in our setting are smooth. After a re-match, patients generally see a PCP who is located at about the same geographic distance as the previous PCP. For the re-matched patient, we find that there is essentially no change in the likelihood of visiting the PCP. This smooth transition is arguably due to an institutional feature of the Danish health care system entailing immediate re-matching upon separation by the government. This first set of results allows us to move beyond simple reduced form analyses and speak directly to the link between separations and health care utilization absent any concomitant effects stemming from lack of access to care. We first observe an increase in fee-for-service per visit of around 17% suggesting that patients receive more services after the reassignment. We also detect an unexpected, but potentially beneficial consequence of the new patient-PCP match—an increase in the probability that the patient initiates drug therapy targeting hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. These are conditions that are widely considered underdiagnosed in most populations (Fryar et al., 2010; Wall et al., 2014). We find that a change in provider due to practice closure leads to a 30‒60% increase in the uptake of drugs targeting one of these conditions immediately following a closure. This corresponds to somewhere between 25 and 100 additional patients initiating treatment for these illnesses for every 10,000 patients experiencing a closure. Further, while the change in provider does not lead to diminished access to primary care, we observe increases in the probability of hospital admissions related to these chronic diseases – and even hospitalizations associated with cancer. Finally, we observe a moderate increase in the use of emergency care.====Based on a two-way patient/physician fixed effects model (along the lines of Abowd et al., 1999; Finkelstein et al., 2016, and Markussen and Røed, 2017) we show that the increase in the use of drug therapy is ==== because the newly matched PCPs are relatively predisposed to prescribing these drugs. Instead, it appears that when patients match to new PCPs, this precipitates a consequential reassessment of those patients’ ongoing medical needs. This finding indicates that PCPs are probably not sufficiently attentive to the changing needs of their existing patient base.====Our analyses contribute to the literature concerned with the consequences of PCP-patient separations for health care utilization (e.g., Kwok, 2018; Bischof and Kaiser, 2019). We move beyond this literature and add novel outcomes informative about prescription drug use that are more closely related to actual patient health. We do this in a setting where access to case is continuous, allowing us to ascribe the estimated effects solely to the discontinuity rather than a mixture of discontinuity and access. Finally, our rich and complete administrative data allows us characterize provider behavior, enabling an analysis of pivotal provider-induced mechanisms behind the observed changes in patient behavior.

Although relevant, the individual's ability to correctly predict the valuation that other individuals assign to the risk reduction has been insufficiently researched. We aim to verify whether individuals exhibit pure altruistic preferences and if this is the case, whether the presence of pure ==== leads to biased valuation of public risk reductions due to misjudgement about other individuals' preferences. We conduct a large-scale online incentivised experiment as a variant of a public good game in which the individual's final endowment is determined by choices made in the experiment. Results suggest that individuals act as pure altruists and hence try to account for the benefits obtained by others of being insured. The results also suggest that individuals fail to correctly predict other individuals' benefits from the insurance, which leads to non-optimal outcomes and biased valuations.","It is well-established that individuals are concerned with the well-being of others and that utility functions are interdependent (Arrow, 1974; Bergstrom, 1982). In order to ensure that public sector policies are aligned with citizens’ preferences, it is therefore relevant to consider and account for this interdependency. In countries with a public health sector a key objective is to continuously reconfigure the health insurance package to ensure access to vital health care services. This involves ensuring that the financial responsibility is appropriately shared, thereby minimising the financial risk to the individual (future) patient. Stated preference (SP) methods can be applied to estimate the value of access to specific health care services and the associated improvements in health. Such valuations are framed either as choices made in a private insurance setting or a public insurance setting, with the latter encompassing altruistic motives in addition to self-interests. SP studies have found public valuations to be both higher than private valuations (Araña and León, 2002; Gyrd-Hansen, 2015; Pedersen et al., 2011) but, in contrast to expectations, also lower than values elicited in a private insurance setting (Gyrd-Hansen et al., 2016; Johannesson et al., 1996). These latter counterintuitive findings are highly prominent in the value of a statistical life literature where a meta-analysis of 74 stated preference studies found the value of a statistical life to be 80% higher when WTP was elicited in the private perspective compared to a public perspective (de Blaeij, Florax, Rietveld, and Verhoef, 2003). This finding has been backed up by more recent studies (Hultkrantz et al., 2006; Svensson and Johansson, 2010).====To understand the divergence in estimates across perspectives, attention must be drawn to three key related issues which may play a role. Firstly, a distinction must be made between pure altruistic and paternalistic altruistic preferences. Secondly, reflections are required on the choice of payment vehicle and the implications this has on valuations given these two possible preference sets. Thirdly, to the extent that individuals exhibit pure altruistic preferences, the participant's ability to correctly predict the value that other participants assign to the good in question should be verified.====Jones-Lee (1991, 1992) and Bergstrom (1982) make a distinction between paternalistic altruism and pure altruism. Paternalistic altruism refers to a situation in which an individual cares about a specified dimension of other individuals' welfare. This implies that the individual's utility function contains a single parameters of other individuals' utility function. Paternalistic altruism can for example be health-focused or wealth-focused, depending on which dimension of other people's lives the individual perceives to be paramount. As paternalistic altruism is strictly positive, the inclusion of paternalistic altruism in the valuation of positive increments in health outcomes will all else equal lead to higher valuations than similar health outcomes elicited from a private perspective (e.g. Araña and León (2002)). Pure altruism, on the other hand, refers to situations where the individual is concerned with the overall welfare of others and hence respects other individuals’ preferences. In this case another person's utility will enter directly into the individual's utility function.====Whether an individual is a pure altruist or a paternalistic altruist may lead to different reactions to the choice of payment vehicle. When valuations are elicited from a private perspective, out-of-pocket payment or private insurance premium are the relevant payment vehicles. In contrast, if valuations are elicited from a public perspective, the payment vehicle can be either non-coercive donation or, as is more often the case, coercive (uniform) taxation. If the chosen payment vehicle is a uniform==== coercive tax, the pure altruist will consider the implications an increase in coercive payment has on others’ utility as the implications for others is salient (Beeson et al., 2019; Gyrd-Hansen et al., 2016; Johansson, 1994; Jones-Lee, 1991, 1992;Messer et al., 2013). In this case pure altruism can impact positively or negatively on the valuation of public goods. For instance, an individual may be concerned about coercing others into having to pay the same amount for the public initiative as herself, if she believes that other individuals value it less than she does. This may imply that the individual will state a lower willingness to pay (WTP) relative to what she would have paid in a private perspective. Vice versa, the individual may state a higher WTP relative to her private valuation is she believes that other individuals value the good more than she does. In contrast, for the health-focused paternalistic altruist, the choice of payment vehicle has no impact on the social value, as the payment of others is not of interest.====According to Bergstrom (1982) and Jones-Lee (1991, 1992) pure altruism may lead to inflated valuations (also referred to as ‘double counting’) if the pure altruist only considers the benefits of the public good to others and not the costs. Johansson (1994) demonstrates that unbiased estimates of the value of a risk reduction can be obtained if participants are asked to state their WTP conditional on all other individuals paying an amount that keeps them at their initial level of utility. This condition not only ensures unbiased estimates but entails that any altruistic motivations are annulled and that a pure altruist should state a WTP for the public good equal to her private valuation. Likewise, Beeson et al. (2019) show that unbiased estimate can be obtained from a range of payment vehicles when choices are made under veil of ignorance. Although such payment settings may ensure unbiased WTP estimates, they are not commonly applied. This is most likely because they are less credible and can be criticised for not representing the genuine payment mechanism (coercive tax) used to financing public insurances.====We assert that applying coercive tax can in principle generate unbiased welfare estimates. However, when public goods are funded by coercive (uniform) taxation and individuals hold pure altruistic motivations, it becomes critical that individuals have a good sense of how policy initiatives impact the marginal utility of others. Gyrd-Hansen et al. (2016) found suggestive evidence that the combination of participants being pure altruists and at the same time wrongfully estimating other people's valuations leads to underestimation of the true social value of health risk reductions when payments are coercive.====The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we aim to verify whether individuals encompass pure altruistic motives when evaluating public goods. To do this we elicited preferences for a social insurance with (uniform) coercive payment. Second, we verify if the presence of pure altruism leads to biased valuation because individuals hold wrong beliefs about the value that the other individuals assign to the public good. We conduct a large-scale online incentivised experiment where participants are given an initial endowment and a risk of losing it. Participants are then given the possibility of buying either a private or a public insurance which will eliminate the risk and subsequently asked how much they will be willing to pay for such an insurance. The study is about preferences for reduced financial risk. Since WTP for public goods is ultimately about ensuring access to all without compromising individual welfare, we argue that these financial risks proxy the possible social welfare implications of increased risk of adverse events, including health incidents.====Our study extends previous literature on public valuations and altruism in multiple ways. First, compared to other studies which have looked at the presence of pure altruism, we operate with a larger representative sample of the general population and we are able to link individual responses with administrative data on e.g. socioeconomic status and health state. Second, our study is unique as it has been designed with the purpose of measuring both participants' beliefs about other individuals' valuation of the good and how they react to corrections in these possibly wrong beliefs. Third, we apply an incentivised public good experiment in which the individual's final endowment is determined by the choices made in the experiment.",Pure altruism and misjudgement: A bad combination?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629621001351,1 November 2021,2021,Research Article,103.0

Under capitation, physicians are compensated with a fixed amount per ==== claims and leverage capitation variation within the plan and physician to mitigate selection concerns. The results show that the treatment intensity—primarily derived from therapy and diagnostic testing —of patients under a capitation system is 7–12% lower than that of similar patients in a non-capitated plan. Furthermore, we find no evidence of increased relapse rates for patients in a capitated plan.","Health care spending accounts for an increasing share of gross domestic product in the United States. Efforts to control health care spending have focused on patients incentives, such as deductibles. However, recent studies have found that patients found it challenging to shop for low-price services (Chernew et al., 2018) and responded to deductibles by reducing high- and low-value care (Brot-Goldberg et al., 2017). Providers incentives might be more effective since providers are better informed about the costs and benefits of the treatment. One such incentive is the use of the capitated payment model. Under capitation, physicians are compensated based on the number of patients they treat rather than the volume of services they prescribe. Payers who have adopted capitation claim that this payment model can reduce the use of medical services and the provision of low-value care, which are the two factors contributing to the increased cost of health care services (Waddill, 2020). For instance, Shrank et al. (2019) estimate that the annual cost of overtreatment rose from about $75.7 billion in 2012 to $101.2 billion in 2019 in the US. The literature also documents a range of potentially low-value care.==== Essentially, the capitated payment contract transfers all or part of the financial risk to the physicians, encouraging them to be accountable for the number of services they provide. The recently established accountable care organizations in Medicare and private insurers are examples of the capitation payment model.====It can be challenging to assess whether capitated contracts lead to cost savings because providers and payers can select whether to use capitation. For example, capitation contracts are more common in managed care plans, such as health maintenance organizations (HMOs). These plans may attract patients with lower medical needs rather than truly reduce unnecessary care. Similarly, physicians who tend to prescribe less care may be more willing to participate in a capitated payment model. Understanding the sources of any potential cost difference driven by capitation contracts is essential in evaluating whether such incentives should be implemented more widely.====In this paper, we empirically examine the effects of capitated payment models on physicians treatment decisions. The shift toward managed care in the 1990s and early 2000s led to the growing popularity of capitation contracts in many regions.==== This historical shift toward capitation contracts provides an opportunity to study the issue. To this end, we focus on the treatment of lower back pain (LBP) because the condition is economically significant: about 80% of the US population is affected by LBP at some point, and the treatment expenditure exceeds $50 billion annually. More importantly, the treatment varies greatly across patients and providers (Smith, 2011). For example, certain diagnostic imaging services are costly, with limited benefits (or may be harmful to certain patients) (Chou, Fu, Carrino, Deyo, 2009, Chou, Qaseem, Owens, Shekelle, 2011, Flynn, Smith, Chou, 2011). However, the use of imaging is intensive: Schwartz et al. (2014) estimated that the 2014 Medicare spending on imaging for unspecified LBP ranged from $82 million to $226 million. These findings cast doubts on the efficacy of the treatment. They also raise the question of whether the capitated payment model helps reduce the overuse of low-value services in treating LBP.====We use Truven MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Data from 2003 to 2006, a commercial insurance claim dataset based on the working-age US population. We construct and identify more than 60,000 episodes of treating LBP. For each episode, we identify the primary care physicians, who play a central role in deciding the subsequent care. We directly observe whether these physicians are paid under capitation from the data, and we use this information as the key independent variable. We then build a treatment intensity measure to capture the number of services used for each episode. We remove price variation across plans and providers by estimating the national average price of each procedure using non-capitated claims.====We use a fixed-effects model to control for patient and physician selection into a capitation payment arrangement. First, patients treated by a primary care physician under a capitated plan may differ from other patients who are not. To address this selection problem, we control for patients demographic information and chronic conditions generated from past claims. In addition, we identify patients who stay in the same set of plans during the sample period and control for the plan history fixed effects. By doing so, we leverage two sources of variation in capitation: first, a given plan can contract with multiple providers with different capitation arrangements; second, employers may switch plan types over time (for example, switch from a traditional plan to a managed care plan). This procedure allows us to control for unobserved patient selection into capitated plans. Second, we control for physician fixed effects to account for physician selection in capitated contracts. The specification leverages variation in the capitation status from the same physician treating patients under capitated and non-capitated payment models.====We find that patients treated by physicians under a capitated contract experience a moderate reduction in their treatment intensity. The overall treatment intensity is 7–12% lower for patients in a capitated plan than for other patients, and these results are robust to a range of different specifications. The treatment difference is mainly driven by diagnostic testing (17–30%) and therapy (14–17%). There is almost no difference in the use of surgery. We also find no evidence that capitation leads to significantly different use of any drugs, opioids, or muscle relaxants. We conduct several robustness checks and placebo tests to illustrate the robustness of the key results.====Furthermore, we find that the differences in treatment lead to no difference in relapse rates for LBP in subsequent years. For patients in our benchmark sample who can be tracked over the next four years after the end of their episodes, we find that the likelihood of having another LBP-related episode is similar for capitated and non-capitated patients. This finding suggests that capitation effectively reduces treatment intensity in LBP episodes without causing adverse treatment outcomes.====This paper contributes to the growing literature studying whether the capitated payment model reduces unnecessary care. Much of the existing literature shows that managed care plans lead to higher spending in Medicaid because of weaker bargaining power than federal or state governments (Duggan, 2004) and lower overall spending in private insurance markets (Cutler, McClellan, Newhouse, 2000, Gaynor, Rebitzer, Taylor, 2004). In cases where capitation leads to lower spending, prior works typically attribute the changes to price reduction: capitated plans pay lower prices for the same services (Altman, Cutler, Zeckhauser, 2003, Cutler, McClellan, Newhouse, 2000), partially because they refer patients to lower-priced hospitals (Ho and Pakes, 2014). Physicians under managed-care plans also prescribe more generic drugs (Dickstein, 2017, Limbrock, 2011, Sacks, 2018). We contribute to this literature by showing that capitated providers also lead to real efficiency gains by reducing the treatment intensity of LBP. Our results supplement previous works that find minor treatment intensity differences for more acute or severe conditions (Altman, Cutler, Zeckhauser, 2003, Cutler, McClellan, Newhouse, 2000). In contrast, we find that capitation mainly reduces diagnostic tests and therapy sessions. These findings highlight that capitation plays a more significant role in reducing the treatment intensity for minor conditions and more elective services.====Our study differs from the previous works in identifying variations of capitation. Many studies examine the effects of capitated arrangements using cross-plan or cross-insurer variations (e.g., Altman, Cutler, Zeckhauser, 2003, Ho, Pakes, 2014, Sacks, 2018). The problem with such approaches is that capitation often exists along with other cost-control methods, such as narrow networks, utilization authorization, and selected covered benefits (Glied and Zivin, 2002).==== To address these issues, we construct the capitation measure directly from claims data. Part of our variation in capitation comes from comparing treatment decisions within partially capitated plans, which separates the effects of capitated contracts from other supply-side cost-control incentives.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the background information on LBP and capitation contracts. Section 3 presents the empirical strategy, and the results are presented in Section 4.

Our ==== model addresses simultaneity, homophily, health endogeneity, non-random attrition, and multiplicity of equilibria together. Using network data from the Framingham Heart Study, we find smaller social interaction effects among spouses and friends than Christakis and Fowler (2008) who pioneered such exploration with these data. We also find that social interaction impacts of the endogenous behaviors of siblings or a parent and an adult child are not statistically significant after disentangling them from homophily. In addition, we find that the effects of social contacts’ cardiovascular disease ==== on individual smoking behavior are not statistically significant.","In economics, social interactions reflect the interdependence among individuals when the characteristics and behaviors of one individual influence the preferences, beliefs, or constraints of another (Durlauf and Ioannides, 2010). The impacts of social contacts on individual smoking behavior are of particular interest to public health and health economics researchers (Christakis, Fowler, 2008, Clark, Etilé, 2006, Cutler, Glaeser, 2010, Fletcher, Marksteiner, 2017). A common empirical hurdle in this application, and in the study of social interactions generally, is identification of social interaction effects of endogenous actions, i.e., the causal effects of social contacts’ smoking behaviors on an individual’s smoking behavior (Manski, 1993). The interest in quantifying these effects stems from a desire to better understand smoking behavior as well as to prescribe effective anti-smoking policy. The existence of endogenous social interaction effects suggests that a policy intervention with a direct impact on an individual’s smoking behavior will also indirectly impact the individual’s social contacts’ behaviors and may spread through the social network (Cutler and Glaeser, 2010). Reliable measures of endogenous social interaction effects and hence, the “social multiplier” effects, provide policymakers with an important component involved in cost-effective analyses of anti-smoking policies.====The purpose of this work is to better understand the impact of behavior of a close social contact - a spouse, friend, sibling, parent or adult child - on individual behavior. We do so in the context of a familiar study of smoking behavior, namely Christakis and Fowler (2008). We obtain the network data from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) and replicate the findings of this well-cited publication.==== Having re-constructed their sample of social pairs and replicated their findings using the same empirical techniques, we then consider several econometric concerns simultaneously to improve the consistency and efficiency of the estimated impacts. Our econometric model extends the current literature by addressing simultaneity, homophily, health endogeneity, non-random attrition, and multiplicity of equilibria together.====Studies that attempt to measure the impacts of inter-related smoking behaviors often rely on strong assumptions due to the difficulty of disentangling endogenous social interaction effects from other factors (Christakis and Fowler, 2008). In particular, to identify how social contacts’ smoking behaviors affect an individual’s smoking behavior, researchers must address three important considerations that may lead one to misinterpret an observed correlation as causal. These considerations are: 1.) the simultaneous influence of an individual’s smoking behavior and her social contact’s behavior on each other; 2.) an observed peer relationship that developed because of individual characteristics that also influence smoking (non-smoking), such as they both value health less (more); and 3.) dependence of smoking behaviors on other (exogenous) factors, such as cigarette prices or smoking advertisements. These problems are documented in the literature as ==== and ====, respectively (Bramoullé, Djebbari, Fortin, 2009, Christakis, Fowler, 2008, De Giorgi, Pellizzari, Redaelli, 2010).====We identify the social interaction effects of smoking behavior while carefully addressing these econometric considerations. To address the simultaneity problem, we model an individual’s observed smoking behavior as the optimal solution to a discrete choice problem that depends on her own marginal utility of smoking and her observed social contacts’ smoking behaviors, which are being chosen by those individuals at the same time. According to this game theoretical model, an individual and her (one) social contact’s smoking behaviors are jointly described as a 2-player simultaneous move game (e.g., between the individual and his/her spouse, between two friends, between two siblings, or between a parent and an adult child) with complete information. The game is assumed to have a Pure Strategy Nash Equilibrium, and the players’ decisions are assumed to lead to one of the Pure Strategy Nash Equilibria. We address, in estimation, the multiple equilibria problem by estimating the probability of each equilibrium.==== Identification is achieved using exclusion restrictions, which differ across different types of relationships, for the individual’s smoking behavior and her social contact’s smoking behavior. For example, for spouses, we use information that affects smoking behaviors of each member of the couple before their marriage and assume that this information has no effect on their smoking behavior after marriage, once we control for own past behaviors.====To address homophily, we allow alter characteristics (observed and unobserved) to affect ego behavior. We also study how own and social contacts’ health shocks affect an individual’s smoking behavior. The endogenous health shocks (i.e., a cardiovascular disease event) are modeled as a function of individuals’ past smoking behaviors, one’s history of health shocks, other observed individual characteristics and unobserved heterogeneity. We use high-normal blood pressure (i.e., systolic blood pressure between 130 and 139 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure between 85 and 89 mm Hg) as an exclusion restriction for onset of cardiovascular disease. The relationship between high-normal blood pressure and a cardiovascular disease event was not well known during much of the time span of our data; therefore, we assume that neither the knowledge of nor the experience of high-normal blood pressure influenced individuals’ smoking behavior directly.==== Furthermore, to disentangle the endogenous social interaction effects from confounding, our model of individual smoking behaviors over multiple periods allows that behavior to depend on one’s previous smoking behaviors, permanent individual unobserved heterogeneity, and unobserved time-varying factors.====The data we use to measure social interaction effects are from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) with its complementary social networks information (FHS-Net).==== A unique feature of these data is that researchers followed individuals and identified social contact relationships, such as spouses, friends, siblings, or parents, over time, which is important for our identification strategy. While these data have been used to study social interactions in the context of smoking (Christakis and Fowler, 2008), obesity (Christakis and Fowler, 2007), and happiness (Fowler, Christakis, 2008, Rosenquist, Fowler, Christakis, 2011) among other things, our research differs because we jointly address concerns about simultaneity, homophily, confounding, and attrition in order to identify endogenous social interaction effects, and replicate the sample used by other researchers in order to directly compare results. Other studies have addressed subsets of these econometric concerns using different data sets such as AddHealth in the context of individual behaviors (Badev, 2013, Cohen-Cole, Fletcher, 2008) and auction data in the context of firm behaviors (Bajari et al., 2010).====We summarize our findings here. First, we find statistically significant endogenous social interaction effects for some paired contacts, namely spouses and friends. Our results suggest that a wife who does not smoke decreases her husband’s propensity to continue smoking by 7.8 percentage points relative to a smoking wife; a husband who does not smoke decreases his wife’s propensity to continue smoking by 8.5 percentage points relative to a smoking husband; and a friend who does not smoke decreases her friend’s propensity to continue smoking by 4.2 percentage points. A sibling’s or parent’s smoking behavior does not have statistically significantly effects, but the parent of a non-smoking child (of adult age) is less likely to smoke.==== We find that the estimates for endogenous social interaction effects exhibit a large positive bias when we fail to control for simultaneity or homophily. For example, the marginal effect of a wife on a husband is inflated by about 50 percent if simultaneity is not addressed. With no controls for homophily due to unobserved heterogeneity (even after controlling for past smoking behavior), the estimates would suggest statistically significant (yet upwardly biased) marginal effects of a parent’s smoking behavior on an adult child’s behavior or a sibling’s smoking behavior on another sibling’s behavior (7.5 and 4.4 percentage points, respectively) when a causal effect does not exist.====In addition, we find that the effects of social contacts’ cardiovascular disease shocks on individual smoking behavior are not statistically significant for each of the types of relationships we study. These results are consistent with Khwaja et al. (2006), who find no statistically significant effects of spousal health shocks on own smoking, and consistent with Darden and Gilleskie (2016), who find no statistically significant effects of parents’ health shocks on adult children’s smoking behavior.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

We implemented a cluster randomized control trial that randomly provides four-month-long Behavior Change Communication (BCC) and food vouchers in Ethiopia. We find improvements in child-feeding practices and a reduction in chronic child undernutrition only when BCC and vouchers are provided together. BCC or voucher alone had limited impacts. Our results highlight the importance of adding an effective educational component to existing transfer programs.","In developing countries, nutritional status is a critical component of health, especially for children under the age of two (Schwarzenberg et al., 2018). Child undernutrition is linked to nearly half of all deaths in children under five and affects more than 150 million young children (World Bank, 2017). Child undernutrition is also an important challenge for economic development because it leads to poorer health, education, and labor outcomes in adulthood (Black et al., 2008; Hoddinott et al., 2013). These health and economic effects are long-term, spanning adulthood and even generations (Hoddinott et al., 2008; Chakrabarti et al., 2021).====Drawing from the large literature on the causes of chronic child undernutrition, many interventions have focused on addressing a single cause of undernutrition such as micronutrient deficiencies (Muller et al., 2003; der Merwe et al., 2013), lack of knowledge (Fitzsimons et al., 2016), and lack of income (Manley et al., 2013), but often found limited impact. Moreover, it is estimated that the summed impact of ten single-dimensional nutrition-specific interventions, without accounting for complementarities, would reduce chronic child undernutrition by only 20% at nearly full coverage (Bhutta et al., 2013).====This modest impact could be due to the single-dimensional approach that most interventions take, despite the multifaceted and interdependent causes of undernutrition. To illustrate, nutrition education might have limited impact if low level of income hinders knowledge application. Also, impacts of transfer programs could be limited if lack of information is a binding constraint.====Despite the conceptual and instrumental importance of combining education with transfer programs, many do not have an educational component. In-kind and cash transfers, with improving nutritional status being one of their core aims, reach more than 1 billion people worldwide (Fiszbein et al., 2014; Alderman et al., 2018). Yet, the largest of such transfer programs including the Public Distribution System in India and the ==== program in Brazil lack an effective educational component, even though its end goal is to improve diet quality (Alderman et al., 2018; Paes-Sousa et al., 2011). Moreover, nutrition-related messaging, where provided, is often delivered ineffectively, limiting its ability to affect behaviors (Rivera et al., 2019). Therefore, given the evidence on the limited impact of transfers on child nutrition (Manley et al., 2013), it seems crucial to couple transfers with nutrition education, and to test its effectiveness against standalone programs.====In this paper, we study the roles of knowledge and affordability in changing mothers’ child-feeding practices as well as child growth. To do so, we designed and implemented a community-based cluster randomized experiment in Ethiopia that provides nutrition education in the form of behavioral change communication (BCC) and food vouchers in collaboration with Africa Future Foundation (AFF), an international NGO focused on health and education programs in sub-Saharan Africa. Specifically, we randomly provided four-month-long BCC (====), voucher (====), and both BCC and voucher (====) interventions for mothers with one or more children between four and 20 months of age.====This age range is important because stunting prevalence increases rapidly after the first six months as shown in Appendix A, which is when complementary feeding should start and exclusive breastfeeding no longer meets the energy and nutrients needed for rapid child growth (WHO, 2009). Thus, adopting appropriate complementary feeding during this transitional period is particularly crucial for preventing undernutrition (Black et al., 2013).====As pre-specified in the pre-analysis plan at AEA RCT Registry, our primary outcomes are nutritional knowledge and child-feeding practice measures, with child anthropometry measures being secondary outcomes (Han et al., 2017). One of the strengths of this study is that we examine comprehensive measures of nutritional intakes, food expenditures, and child growth. For example, we carefully measure dietary quality and quantity using various standard World Health Organization (WHO) measures and household expenditures, each examining different aspects of children’s diets. We also take advantage of detailed administrative data on BCC participation and food voucher usage. In addition, we collect various anthropometry data to explore child growth results.====We find large impacts of ====, smaller impacts of ====, and no impact of ==== on child-feeding behaviors. Specifically, ==== improves maternal nutritional knowledge and child-feeding practices and increases purchase of more diverse food to a limited extent. However, these small changes did not translate into child growth improvements. As for the ==== group, we find no effect on nutritional knowledge, child-feeding behaviors, and child growth. To the contrary, ==== considerably augments the positive impacts on nutritional knowledge, child-feeding behaviors, and diversified food purchase. We also find evidence for stunting reduction in this group. The impacts are driven by the prevention of stunting among those who were at risk of stunting or healthy at baseline—i.e., above -2 SD in the HAZ distribution—rather than recovering stunted growth.====Our results render important policy implications. For social protection or nutrition programs aiming to reduce child undernutrition, providing both nutrition education and food voucher simultaneously could be more effective than single interventions. In addition, when implementing programs to address undernutrition, it may be best to target all infant and young children in the critical age range of 4 to 20 months regardless of baseline nutritional status, rather than targeting only the already undernourished children because ==== is particularly effective in preventing stunting from occurring in this age range rather than reversing it.====This research contributes to broadly two strands of literature. First, we contribute to the growing literature on the effectiveness of multifaceted programs on addressing multiple causes of poverty simultaneously. Conceptually, implementing multiple interventions at once to address the same problem has either crowding-out, additive, or complementary effects. It is important to identify interventions that do not crowd-out each other and implement them together to maximize cost-effectiveness. Some existing RCT studies with factorial design show that a program that integrates a water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) intervention with nutrition supplements may not necessarily have complementary effects on diarrhea and child growth (Luby et al., 2018; Null et al., 2018). On the other hand, while not specifically on nutrition, an RCT study conducted in Tanzania finds complementarity between unconditional grants to schools and teacher incentives based on student performance (Mbiti et al., 2019). This suggests that whether a set of combined nutrition interventions have synergistic effects is an empirical question, which may vary by existing constraints and types of intervention. Existing experimental studies on BCC and transfers do not have a factorial design and thus are unable to test complementarity: for example, recent BCC experiments conducted in Bangladesh lack a BCC only arm (Hoddinott et al., 2017; Hoddinott et al., 2018; Ahmed et al., 2019). To our knowledge, this study is the first study to test complementarity between nutrition education and vouchers.====We also contribute to the empirical literature on the effects of stand-alone intervention programs on child-feeding practices and child nutrition such as nutrition education and income support. Our study is unique in that we can directly compare nutrition education and transfers in the same setting. On the effects of BCC, recent experimental studies conducted in Bangladesh and Burkina Faso have provided causal evidence on the effectiveness of nutrition education programs on improving nutritional knowledge among caregivers and neighbors, feeding practices, and nutritional outcomes (Fitzsimons et al., 2016; Hoddinott et al., 2018; Hoddinott et al., 2017; Olney et al., 2015; Zongrone et al., 2018). However, all of these programs except for Fitzsimons et al., 2016 (Fitzsimons et al., 2016) were coupled with other programs such as transfers and agricultural interventions, which limits the ability to single out the effect of BCC. Our study adds to the literature by showing the extent to which a BCC-only intervention with a relatively short-term and cost-effective program could be effective.====On the impacts of food vouchers, we find that food vouchers without any educational component has no effect on child nutrition. This is in line with a meta-analysis examining 21 papers on 17 programs which finds that cash transfers have a positive but small and not statistically significant impact on child height (Manley et al., 2013).====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the study design and the interventions; Section 3 describes the data and sample characteristics; Section 4 presents the conceptual framework and the empirical methods; Section 5 presents the results; and we conclude in Section 6.",The Roles of Nutrition Education and Food Vouchers in Improving Child Nutrition: Evidence from a Field Experiment in Ethiopia,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629621001302,21 October 2021,2021,Research Article,106.0

Due to charity care, they may face an increase in the price of ","Lacking access to other forms of healthcare, the poor and uninsured rely on emergency departments for routine medical care. In part to address this over-reliance, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded public insurance to over 12 million individuals who had previously been ineligible for public insurance (Uberoi et al., 2016). There is an extensive literature investigating the efficacy of public insurance expansions on emergency department usage (e.g., Miller (2012), Taubman et al. (2014), Klein et al. (2017), Dunn et al. (2021), etc.) with mixed findings. The idea of such expansions is that the previously uninsured will seek more cost-effective and appropriate care after receiving public insurance. This idea is incomplete. Medicaid expansions do not usually apply to just the uninsured; “crowd-out” of private health insurance also occurs (Cutler and Gruber, 1996).====There are two separate effects of expanding the eligibility of public insurance. There is the intended expansionary effect – the change in healthcare utilization from consumers going from uninsured to covered by public insurance; but there is also a crowd-out effect – the change in healthcare utilization from consumers switching from private insurance to public insurance. The direction of each effect will be determined by the relative price changes / differential access to healthcare after each group gains public insurance. These relative changes can be radically different between the two groups. The previously uninsured see a stark decrease in the price of traditional primary care after gaining public insurance. However, due to charity care policies, the previously uninsured actually face a small increase in the price of an emergency department visit.==== In contrast, the previously insured see a large reduction in the price of an emergency department visit while their access to primary care is reduced. Understanding how ==== new public insurance recipients utilize healthcare is important for effectively designing future public insurance expansions, preparing healthcare providers for changes in demand, and measuring the effectiveness of current public insurance expansions.====In this paper, we examine the impact of the prior insurance status of the newly publicly insured on substitution between different forms of healthcare. We base our identification on the staggered roll-out of California’s Low Income Health Program (LIHP) and subsequent ACA Medicaid expansions. We first find that California’s total emergency department utilization increased following the LIHP and ACA Medicaid expansions. However, this increase was driven entirely by those who were crowded-out. We then document that the previously insured ==== increased their usage of community clinics, due to the reduced access to traditional primary care that comes with Medicaid vs. private insurance. In contrast, the previously uninsured (1) reduced their usage of community clinics, and (2) did not change their emergency department usage, implying a shift towards traditional primary care, which is typically unavailable to the uninsured. We find that the increase in emergency department utilization by those crowded-out increased healthcare expenditures in California between $130 and $825 million per year, depending on the percentage of emergency department visits that were primary care treatable.====Our study is novel in three key ways. We are the first to decompose the crowd-out and expansionary effects of a public insurance expansion on emergency department utilization. Currently, the literature examines the total effect (e.g., Dresden et al. (2017); Nikpay et al. (2017); Sommers et al. (2016), etc.) or just the expansionary effect (e.g., Dunn et al. (2021); Miller (2012); Taubman et al. (2014), etc.) of a public insurance expansion on emergency department usage. Second, our paper is novel in our combination of the crowd-out literature with the expansionary literature on emergency department usage, which gives a more complete picture of the impact of public insurance expansions. Finally, we are the first to use machine learning techniques to estimate crowd-out. A large literature exists estimating crowd-out following public insurance expansions (e.g., Card and Shore-Sheppard (2004); Cutler and Gruber (1996); Hamersma and Kim (2013); Lo Sasso and Buchmueller (2004), etc.), but the data requirements for directly observing crowd-out are onerous. Instead, we use machine learning techniques to predict prior insurance status based on observable covariates from cross-sectional data – a methodological advance that greatly expands the ability of future researchers to examine the impact of crowd-out in other settings using publicly available data where crowd-out cannot be directly observed. We show through a form of cross validation that our preferred technique, a random forest, has better predictive power and less bias than more traditional estimation techniques.====There are three main choices in receiving healthcare: visit an emergency department, receive primary care in a private clinic, or receive primary care in a community clinic. Prior to gaining Medicaid, the cheapest healthcare options for the uninsured in California with incomes 100% to 138% of the federal poverty line (FPL) were receiving free emergency department care or free primary care at a community clinic.==== Visits to a private primary care clinic were relatively expensive (if accessible at all), with an uninsured individual with income 100-138% FPL paying on average $170 out-of-pocket for these visits. In contrast, the cheapest healthcare options for privately insured individuals with incomes of 100-138% FPL were visits to a private primary clinic or a community clinic, which both have an average out-of-pocket cost of $120. A visit to the emergency department for a privately insured individual with income 100-138% FPL costs on average $185 out-of-pocket.====After gaining Medicaid, the cost of care for each visit type changed. The direction of the change depends on the ==== insurance status of the individual. For the intended recipients of the expansion, the uninsured, the price of a private primary care clinic visit ==== while the prices of an emergency department visit and community clinic visit ====. Those who crowded-out (i.e., already had private coverage before receiving Medicaid) faced the opposite price changes. The effective price of a private primary care clinic visit ==== due to a lack of access and the price of a community clinic visit decreased.==== For those who crowded-out, who were not the intended recipients of the expansion, the price of a non-emergency, emergency department visit ==== to $8 – a 95% price decrease.====The different relative price changes, presented in Figure 1, impact how these two populations – the previously privately-insured and previously uninsured – utilize the emergency department after gaining Medicaid. Those who were crowded-out see a large price decrease for emergency departments and should increase their usage. The previously uninsured should substitute away from emergency department visits towards primary care visits, which are now cheaper.==== If individuals were changing their emergency department usage differentially based on relative price changes, we should expect to see other substitutions in healthcare consumption based on these price changes. We further examine the role of cross-price elasticities and substitution effects in healthcare by examining the impact of Medicaid expansion on community clinic usage. In Section 5, we find that substitutions in primary care utilization align with the relative price changes based on prior insurance status.====Currently, the literature examines crowd-out and the expansionary effect in isolation. The empirical results for the expansionary effect of a public insurance expansion on emergency department usage are ambiguous with some finding increases (Dresden, Powell, Kang, McHugh, Cooper, Feinglass, 2017, Nikpay, Freedman, Levy, Buchmueller, 2017, Taubman, Allen, Wright, Baicker, Finkelstein, 2014, Wherry, Miller, 2016) or decreases (Hernandez-Boussard, Burns, Wang, Baker, Goldstein, 2014, McConville, Raven, Sabbagh, Hsia, 2018, Miller, 2012, Sommers, Blendon, Orav, Epstein, 2016). Other studies, such as Gingold et al. (2017), Pines et al. (2016), and Klein et al. (2017), find no statistically significant impact on emergency department utilization as a result of an insurance expansion.====What explains the wide variety of results when examining the impact of public insurance expansions on emergency department usage across different states? The results in the literature, and our own findings, align when taking into account the state-level regulation (or lack thereof) for hospitals to (1) offer financial assistance for patients that may struggle to afford care and (2) disclose these financial assistance policies to patients. The presence or absence of these policies in a state impacts the relative price change that an uninsured individual faces after enrolling in Medicaid. Individuals who were previously privately insured and gain Medicaid will almost uniformly see a decrease in the price of an emergency department visit, regardless of the financial assistance or financial assistance dissemination policies of the state. The expansionary effect is determined by the presence or absence of financial assistance and dissemination policies in the state. However, the crowd-out effect will be in a similar direction across all states. In Section 4.1, we discuss this mechanism in detail and show that the results of the literature align with these policies.====Starting with Cutler and Gruber (1996), a stream of literature examining the take-up of public health insurance expansions by those already privately insured (i.e., crowd-out) has developed in parallel to the purely expansionary emergency department usage literature. Since then, positive estimates of crowd-out from Medicaid have varied drastically depending upon the estimation strategy, Medicaid expansion, and the population analyzed. (Courtemanche, Marton, Ukert, Yelowitz, Zapata, 2017, Frean, Gruber, Sommers, 2017, Kaestner, Garrett, Chen, Gangopadhyaya, Fleming, 2017, Lo Sasso, Buchmueller, 2004, Sommers, Kenney, Epstein, 2014, Wagner, 2015). However, other studies find little to no evidence of crowd-out following a Medicaid expansion (Card, Shore-Sheppard, 2004, Ham, Shore-Sheppard, 2005, Hamersma, Kim, 2013, Shore-Sheppard, 2008). Gruber and Simon (2008) conduct a detailed literature review and find that the estimates range from 0% to 60%.====Many studies, including our own, are interested in the impact of crowd-out on some other variable. These studies estimate crowd-out as a means to an end, not an end itself. We add to this growing literature by being the first to estimate crowd-out using machine-learning and by showing that, at least in our context, machine learning improves performance. Our use of machine learning techniques allows us to include many predictors of crowd-out while avoiding the over-fitting problem.====For public insurance expansions, the prior insurance status of the newly covered population determines the impact on emergency department usage. Yet, the two streams of current literature – the expansionary and crowd-out avenues – have yet to cross. Only considering the aggregate effect, and not separating by channel, leads to an inaccurate interpretation of how expanding public insurance ==== affects their emergency department usage. This paper is an effort to fill that gap. We contribute to the literature through our connection of the crowd-out and the expansionary literature. Additionally, this paper contributes to the literature examining the efficacy of the Medicaid expansion of the ACA and the interaction of charity care policies with public insurance expansions.==== If a goal of expanding public insurance is to limit emergency department over-utilization, it is imperative to understand the interaction of the expansionary and crowd-out effects and adjust policy accordingly.",Crowd-Out and Emergency Department Utilization,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629621001272,19 October 2021,2021,Research Article,107.0

The majority of these new Medicaid enrollees had been uninsured prior to gaining coverage through Medicaid. Economic theory tells us to expect greater demand for health care services as individuals gain health insurance coverage (Pauly 1968). A large body of empirical research supports this theoretical prediction, documenting increased use of health care services among patients in states that chose to expand Medicaid eligibility, compared to those in non-expansion states (Antonisse et al., 2017; Rudowitz and Antonisse 2018). This finding can be seen across many different types of health care services, particularly primary care office visits and checkups (Sommers et al., 2016; Wherry and Miller 2016; Miller and Wherry 2017).====While much is known about the effect of the Medicaid eligibility expansion on use of care, comparatively little research has examined the supply-side response. For such a dramatic uptick in primary care consumption, clinicians must have been willing and able to provide more care to Medicaid beneficiaries (Polsky et al., 2017; Antonisse et al., 2019). Descriptive evidence supports this, finding that primary care physicians in expansion states treated more Medicaid patients than their counterparts in non-expansion states (Neprash et al., 2018). However, many questions remain unanswered by existing research: Did all primary care clinicians treat more Medicaid patients or was this increase concentrated among only some? For clinicians that treated more Medicaid patients, did they do so by working longer hours? If not, did clinicians treat more Medicaid patients by shortening visit length? By treating fewer patients of a different payer type? Limited evidence suggests that the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) Medicaid eligibility expansion did not reduce the quantity of care received by Medicare beneficiaries (Carey et al., 2020), but we know of no studies that have examined spillover effects on patients of other payer types or clinicians’ labor supply responses.====This paper provides the first answers to these questions, quantifying the effect of the ACA's Medicaid expansion on primary care clinicians’ payer mix and labor supply decisions. To do so, we use a nationwide source of all-payer claims and practice management data from 2012 to 2017. We test empirical predictions derived from a model of clinician supply of services to different markets of patients as described by Sloan, Mitchell, and Cromwell (Sloan et al., 1978). In this framework, clinician response to a Medicaid expansion depends on their previous Medicaid participation intensity (i.e., Medicaid share of patient panel). This framework predicts that clinicians with a high share of Medicaid patients before the eligibility expansion will see even more following the change. However, clinicians seeing few Medicaid patients before the expansion will not necessarily see more after.====Using a difference-in-differences research design, we test this theoretical prediction and find an average increase of 12.2 appointments per quarter (or 48.8 annually) for Medicaid patients provided by clinicians in states that expanded Medicaid eligibility. In context, this increase in appointments for Medicaid patients was large (21%) relative to the pre-period average number of Medicaid appointments. However, as a share of total appointments, it represents less than a 2% increase. Decomposing the overall result into appointments for new versus established patients, we find that 6.2 of the 12.2 additional Medicaid appointments per quarter went to patients who had not previously been treated by that physician. The remaining 6.0 appointments went to established patients, 81% of whom had previously been seen with Medicaid coverage. Consistent with theory, we find the largest response among clinicians already treating a high proportion of Medicaid patients before the expansion. This group of clinicians increased their Medicaid participation by a quarterly average of 19.9 additional appointments (or 79.4 annually), following the expansion.====Advancing the existing literature on this topic, we investigate the mechanism underlying this modest increase in Medicaid appointments. We find no evidence that primary care clinicians increased their total labor supply, either by providing more visits, working additional days, nor adding clinicians to their practices. Instead, clinicians rebalanced their patient panels toward Medicaid and away from commercially insured patients. The 1.7 percentage point average increase in Medicaid share of all visits was almost entirely offset by a 1.6 percentage point drop in the share of visits to commercially insured patients, with no change in the percentage of visits for Medicare patients, patients dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid, or uninsured patients. Compared to pre-expansion commercial payer mix, this change represented only a 2.8% relative decrease. However, any substitution away from commercially insured patients in favor of Medicaid patients may surprise some readers, given the large difference in average reimbursement rates between the two payers. We estimate that the foregone revenue from this substitution likely represents less than 1% of revenue from all patient care and is likely consistent with a model in which physicians gain utility from patient benefit. We note that the lack of a labor supply increase in response to the Medicaid expansion is broadly consistent with existing evidence from other public insurance expansions (Garthwaite 2012; He and White 2013), while the lack of a change in Medicare payer mix is consistent with the only other paper to test for negative spillovers from the ACA's Medicaid expansion (Carey et al., 2020).====Interestingly, we do not find a larger response to the expansion among primary care nurse practitioners, compared to physicians. Much of the previous literature has speculated that non-physician providers may play an outsized role in meeting demand when public insurance programs expand (Garthwaite 2012; Carey et al., 2020). However, we know of only one paper to find evidence of this, in the context of dental hygienists and Medicaid coverage of dental services (Buchmueller et al., 2016). Consistent with existing literature, we find that Medicaid represented a greater share of primary care nurse practitioners’ payer mix prior to the expansion (Barnes et al., 2020; Neprash et al., 2020), but the differential increase in expansion states is slightly smaller than that of physicians (9.5 versus 12.2 additional Medicaid visits per quarter). Additionally, we do not find that practices in expansion states differentially added clinicians (nurse practitioner or physician), following the expansion.====In sum, we provide evidence of a modest increase in care for Medicaid beneficiaries in response to the Medicaid eligibility expansion, achieved by treating slightly fewer commercially insured patients rather than increasing labor supply. If every primary care physician and primary care nurse practitioner in the United States provided an additional 25 Medicaid appointments annually, it would amount to 13.5 million appointments – considerably shy of the estimated 19.7 million additional office visits demanded by newly-insured Medicaid beneficiaries during their first year of coverage (Carey et al., 2020).==== This, coupled with our finding of a much larger response among the subset of already high-Medicaid clinicians, suggests that treatment for Medicaid patients became increasingly concentrated among a relatively small number of health care providers, following the eligibility expansion.====This paper proceeds as follows. Section II provides background on the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid eligibility expansion and existing literature on clinician participation in Medicaid. Section III provides a conceptual framework with which to derive empirical predictions. Section IV describes the data used in this paper. Section V details our empirical strategy.

We predict overall life expectancy to increase further; but the increase will be concentrated among higher SES individuals and mortality inequality will continue to increase.,"Although life expectancy in the U.S. increased during the 20th century, improvements in longevity have slowed and possibly reversed (Woolf and Schoomaker, 2019). Moreover, the longevity gap (mortality inequality) between older individuals of high and of low socioeconomic status (SES) has substantially widened in recent decades (Bosworth et al., 2016; Cristia, 2009; Cutler et al., 2011; Case and Deaton, 2015 and 2020; Chetty et al., 2016; Sanzenbacher et al., 2019).==== To gain new insights into the causes of these adverse mortality trends, this paper documents trends and inequalities in a number of risk factors for mortality that are health related. We ask three closely related research questions: (1) How did the population prevalence of various health-related risk factors evolve over recent decades among 54–60-year-old individuals? (2) Did inequalities in these risk factors change over the same time period? (3) How might these health trends affect the life expectancies of these cohorts, at the population level and, as a measure of inequality, in subpopulations? To answer these questions, we use detailed health outcomes from the 1992–2016 waves of the nationally representative Health and Retirement Study (HRS); we estimate the relationship between these health measures and mortality observed in later waves of the panel; and then we forecast mortality using estimated survival models. Importantly we analyze trends in health and mortality inequalities jointly, exploiting the longitudinal features of the HRS data, and use a consistent sample and methodology. Our measure of SES is the quintile of lifetime Social Security benefits, which, because it is based on lifetime earnings, is a good measure of lifetime economic position.====Understanding the magnitude and correlates of mortality inequalities is a first step toward addressing them. Further, trends and inequalities in mortality affect the financing of government programs that serve the older population, such as Social Security, partially determining the duration of payouts and their distribution.====Changes in population health and health behaviors have likely contributed to recent patterns in mortality (Kallestrup-Lamb et al., 2020). Health varies by SES (Bartley, 2016; National Center for Health Statistics, 2012; Singh et al., 2017); and although many health outcomes have improved in recent decades, some have worsened (National Center for Health Statistics, 2018; 2019). In particular, the opioid crisis (Gomes at al., 2018; Kolodny et al., 2015), obesity (Flegal et al., 2012; Frederick et al., 2014), increases in diabetes (Krug, 2016; Menke et al., 2015) and in suicide rates (Rossen et al., 2018; Steelesmith et al., 2019) point to important recent deteriorations in health. There is less and mixed evidence on how inequalities in these health outcomes have changed recently, and how they may have affected mortality. Cutler et al. (2011), for example, found that most health outcomes, including obesity rates, changed similarly across education groups between 1971 and 2004. Using more recent data Bilger et al. (2017) found that obesity inequalities in the general population narrowed, but inequalities in severe obesity remained large. Pak et al. (2016) found increases in obesity inequalities in the population, as well as in subpopulations by race, gender, and age. Pernenkil et al. (2017) found that smoking inequalities grew in recent decades as smoking rates decreased more strongly among high SES individuals. Currie and Schwandt (2016) found that smoking inequalities increased among older individuals in the U.S., and that younger individuals were substantially less likely to smoke, but inequalities among them remained stable after 1990. Income-related inequalities in diabetes may also have increased recently (Chen et al., 2021).====A second explanation for the changes in mortality inequality centers on income and wealth inequalities. Mortality is related to SES (Kitagawa and Hauser, 1973), and according to some research this association is at least partly causal (Buckles et al., 2016; Lleras-Muney, 2005). Inequalities in income and wealth have increased substantially over the past thirty years (Autor et al., 2008; Burkhauser et al., 2011; Meyer and Sullivan, 2017; Piketty and Saez, 2003), and they may have increased mortality inequalities in the U.S. in causal ways. This would be the case, for example, if poorer individuals cannot afford adequate health insurance and health care for themselves, if their mental health due to poverty deteriorates their physical health, if they live in polluted areas, etc.====Population longevity and longevity inequality affect all public programs that serve the older population, particularly Social Security. Social Security benefits are annuities, and the payouts by the Social Security system to a cohort depend on the average level of benefits and life expectancies; but they also depend on the interaction between individual longevity and individual benefit level (Auerbach et al., 2017; Goda et al., 2011). Because individuals with higher benefits have greater longevity, total payouts are greater than if all persons in a cohort had the average longevity of the cohort. Holding constant average mortality but increasing the survival differential in favor of those with high benefits will increase total payouts. Thus, forecasts of the financial position of the Social Security system depend not only on mortality forecasts, but also on the SES gradient in mortality. The 2015 report of the Technical Panel on Assumptions and Methods to the Social Security Advisory Board (Munnell et al., 2015, pp. 20) explicitly called for more research on the implications of mortality inequality for Social Security. The SES measure that we use in this paper is a function of lifetime earnings which are closely tied to Social Security benefits. It is, therefore, a good classification variable to study mortality differentials.====Medicare and Medicaid are medical care annuities and therefore similar considerations apply about total cohort payouts. But there are additional complexities due to co-pays and differential use as a function of SES which prevent the straightforward analyses of total cohort Social Security payouts.====We focus on trends over the 1934–1959 birth cohorts, using health measures that are consistently observed at ages 54–60 in the HRS. Our mortality forecasts are based on a survival model that estimates the relationship between health at baseline (ages 54–60) and mortality observed longitudinally, in contrast to many models that rely on extrapolations from past trends to forecast mortality of future cohorts. Such extrapolations may be inaccurate because they do not take into account changes in health which may alter future trends.====We analyze numerous measures of health, such as self-assessed health, doctor-diagnosed health conditions (hypertension, diabetes, heart problems, cancer, etc.), limitations with activities of daily living (or ADLs, such as walking, eating, dressing), health behaviors, and obesity.====The main strength of our study comes from our use of the high quality HRS data. The HRS has a large sample size of the older U.S. population, and it has followed a number of successive cohorts over many years. The available detailed health measures and the longitudinal nature of the HRS allows estimating how the health status of individuals in their 50 s predicts survival many years in the future. The HRS expends considerable follow-up effort both to keep respondents in the survey and, when they are not interviewed, to find whether the nonresponse is due to death. Consequently, mortality estimates from the HRS closely match life table estimates (Weir, 2016).====To analyze trends in health inequalities we stratify individuals by Social Security wealth, which is defined as the present value of an individual's expected lifetime Social Security benefits.==== This is a summary measure of individuals’ lifetime economic position as well as an indicator of their command of economic resources. We construct cohort-specific quintiles of Social Security wealth to adjust for cohort trends in these variables over time (Bound et al., 2015).====We use individuals’ own reported forecasts of their survival chances, elicited in the HRS through the subjective probability of survival. Because subjective probabilities are forward-looking, we go beyond extrapolating survival from past trends. Analyses of such forward-looking measures exploit information known to the individual that may not be captured in other observed indicators.====We estimate survival models as functions of detailed health variables, demographics, and Social Security wealth, with gender-specific and Social Security wealth-specific cohort-trends. We use these models to predict median life expectancies from ages 55 of six consecutive cohorts born between 1934 and 1959. To simplify language this paper will occasionally use the term “life expectancy” to refer to the predictions of this model.====We found that health status at age 54–60, declined across the 1934–1959 birth cohorts as measured in all health indicators with just a few exceptions (such as decreased rates of smoking). Particularly striking was the worsening of the rates of obesity, diabetes, and levels of pain. People with high Social Security wealth had significantly better health than those with low Social Security wealth, and health inequalities between these groups grew substantially between 1992 and 2016.====Despite the documented decline in baseline health status, our mortality model predicts increasing population life expectancy over time because the general improvements in mortality offset the negative effects of health. However, the increase in population life expectancy is due to large increases among the high wealth groups: we predict little if any increase among the low Social Security wealth groups. Thus, we predict an increasing gap in mortality between high and low SES groups.====All our data come from the years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic which brought about substantial excess mortality. Our estimates of future mortality differentials implicitly assume that the dynamic relationships between Social Security wealth, health, and mortality that we observe in HRS data will return to their long-run paths. Yet, the effects of COVID have fallen disproportionately on low SES persons (Andrasfay and Goldman, 2021) which may increase mortality inequalities in the future even more than what we have forecast. Thus, our estimates possibly underestimate trends in mortality inequalities. Future waves of the HRS will be needed to study and possibly verify this. The effect of the pandemic on health inequalities is even more complex, because of the direct effect of the virus on health and its indirect effect through mortality that likely changed the composition of the surviving sample.====We first provide an overview of the HRS data and the methods we use for documenting health patterns and for predicting survival. Then we show our main results in three steps. We document trends and inequalities in various health measures; we forecast life expectancies; and we carry out a number of internal and external consistency checks of our main results. Then we conclude and discuss the policy implications of our findings.",Forecasting mortality inequalities in the U.S. based on trends in midlife health,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629621001259,1 October 2021,2021,Research Article,109.0

This growth was accompanied by a 7% (0.4 percentage points) decline in tobacco use disorder hospitalizations, yielding a ","As of 2021, 36 states and the District of Columbia adopted medical marijuana laws (MMLs) authorizing physicians to recommend marijuana for patients with eligible health conditions. A subset of 19 MML states have subsequently adopted recreational marijuana laws (RMLs) allowing individuals ages 21+ to possess, use, and supply limited amounts of marijuana for recreational purposes (ProCon, 2019). The proliferation of marijuana liberalization policies coincides with a shift towards positive perceptions and use of marijuana among pregnant women (Jarlenski et al., 2017), who may seek marijuana recreationally or medically to alleviate nausea and other conditions in pregnancy (Parker, Rock, Limebeer, 2011, Roberson, Patrick, Hurwitz, 2014, Young-Wolff, Sarovar, Tucker, Avalos, Alexeeff, Conway, Armstrong, Weisner, Campbell, Goler, 2019). Past-month marijuana use among pregnant women increased 103% between 2003 and 2017, nearly twice the growth among the general U.S. population (Brown, Sarvet, Shmulewitz, Martins, Wall, Hasin, 2017, SAMHSA, 2004, SAMHSA, 2018, Volkow, Han, Compton, McCance-Katz, 2019). Marijuana use during pregnancy is concerning because of potential adverse consequences on perinatal health. While causality is difficult to establish, descriptive epidemiological studies have found that marijuana is associated with impaired judgement and anemia in mothers, stillbirth, low birth weight, low gestational age, and developmental disorders (Conner, Bedell, Lipsey, Macones, Cahill, Tuuli, 2016, Corsi, Walsh, Weiss, Hsu, El-Chaar, Hawken, Fell, Walker, 2019, Crume, Juhl, Brooks-Russell, Hall, Wymore, Borgelt, 2018, Gunn, Rosales, Center, Nuñez, Gibson, Christ, Ehiri, 2016, Wu, Jew, Lu, 2011). The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) discourages physicians from prescribing marijuana during preconception, pregnancy, or lactation and recommends that pregnant women or women contemplating pregnancy discontinue using marijuana (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2017). Despite these recommendations, most state marijuana liberalization policies are silent regarding marijuana use during pregnancy.====Marijuana liberalization may affect perinatal health through intensive or extensive margin changes in maternal use of marijuana and other substances that are complements or substitutes of marijuana. Changes may occur through legal market responses affecting marijuana supply, potency, prices, and access; the diversion of legally produced marijuana; consumer perceptions about marijuana safety, stigma, psychoactive benefits, and therapeutic efficacy; healthcare provider preferences around recommending marijuana versus substitute prescription drugs; criminal justice responses affecting risks of prosecution; and illicit drug market responses affecting the supply, potency, or prices of illegally produced marijuana and other substances (Meinhofer and Rubli, 2021). Marijuana liberalization may also affect the demographic composition of newborns through increases in the number of women who become pregnant by inducing risky sexual behaviors along with greater substance use (Baggio et al., 2020). These general equilibrium effects make the impact of marijuana liberalization policies on perinatal health theoretically ambiguous, and potentially different from findings in descriptive epidemiological studies of prenatal marijuana use.====Previous studies of marijuana liberalization policies primarily focus on the impact of MMLs on teenagers and adults. Research on teenagers generally finds no association between MMLs and marijuana or other substance use (Choo, Benz, Zaller, Warren, Rising, McConnell, 2014, Harper, Strumpf, Kaufman, 2012, Hasin, Wall, Keyes, Cerdá, Schulenberg, O’Malley, Galea, Pacula, Feng, 2015, Keyes, Wall, Cerdá, Schulenberg, O’Malley, Galea, Feng, Hasin, 2016, Lynne-Landsman, Livingston, Wagenaar, 2013, Mark Anderson, Hansen, Rees, 2015, Martins, Mauro, Santaella-Tenorio, Kim, Cerda, Keyes, Hasin, Galea, Wall, 2016, Pacula, Powell, Heaton, Sevigny, 2015). Research on adults while somewhat inconclusive, generally finds growth in marijuana use along with decreases in opioid and tobacco use, which might suggest substitutability (Bachhuber, Saloner, Cunningham, Barry, 2014, Baggio, Chong, Simon, 2020, Bradford, Bradford, Abraham, Adams, 2018, Bradford, Bradford, 2016, Choi, Dave, Sabia, 2019, Chu, 2014, Harper, Strumpf, Kaufman, 2012, Hasin, Sarvet, Cerdá, Keyes, Stohl, Galea, Wall, 2017, Kerr, Lui, Ye, 2018, Martins, Mauro, Santaella-Tenorio, Kim, Cerda, Keyes, Hasin, Galea, Wall, 2016, Mauro, Newswanger, Santaella-Tenorio, Mauro, Carliner, Martins, 2019, Pacula, Powell, Heaton, Sevigny, 2015, Powell, Pacula, Jacobson, 2018, Shi, 2017, Wen, Hockenberry, Cummings, 2015, Wen, Hockenberry, 2018, Williams, Santaella-Tenorio, Mauro, Levin, Martins, 2017). The handful of existing RML studies find growth in marijuana use among adults but inconclusive evidence for teenagers (Anderson, Hansen, Rees, Sabia, 2019, Cerdá, Mauro, Hamilton, Levy, Santaella-Tenorio, Hasin, Wall, Keyes, Martins, 2019, Kerr, Bae, Koval, 2018, Stormshak, Caruthers, Gau, Winter, 2019, Wang, Davies, Halmo, Sass, Mistry, 2018). A scarce body of evidence examines the impact of these policies on pregnant women. One MML study using a difference-in-differences (DID) design found no changes in self-reported marijuana use in a sample of pregnant women (N=11,700), but did find greater marijuana use in a larger and better powered sample of women with children (N=117,600) (Ali et al., 2020). Another MML study using DID found a 33% increase in treatment admissions for marijuana use disorder among pregnant women (Meinhofer et al., 2019). A related MML study using DID found birth rate increases along with greater risky sex behaviors (Baggio et al., 2020). Evidence of the impact of RMLs on pregnant women comes from single-state, descriptive studies. These studies have found increases in measures of prenatal marijuana use, including self-reports and drug testing in biological specimens (Gnofam, Allshouse, Stickrath, Metz, 2020, Grant, Graham, Carlini, Ernst, Brown, 2018, Jones, Baldwin, Shu, 2015, Lee, Pluym, Wong, Kwan, Varma, Rao, 2020). The literature largely ignores the effect of marijuana liberalization on newborns. One MML study using DID found small growth on birth weight but no changes in other outcomes (Petrova and Gray, 2020). RML studies are also based on single-state, descriptive evidence and findings suggest little-to-no-changes in newborn outcomes (Gnofam, Allshouse, Stickrath, Metz, 2020, Lee, Pluym, Wong, Kwan, Varma, Rao, 2020, Lockwood, Moss, Beck, Francis, Schmoll, Wymore, 2019, Siega-Riz, Keim-Malpass, Lyons, Alhusen, 2020).====This study provides the most comprehensive evidence to date of the effect of marijuana liberalization policies on maternal substance use disorders and newborn health. We pooled restricted data from the 2007–2019 National Vital Statistics System Natality Files (NVSS) and the 2007–2018 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Databases (HCUP-SID). Maternal substance use disorders were measured as hospitalizations involving marijuana use disorder, opioid use disorder, alcohol use disorder, stimulant use disorder, tobacco use disorder, and any substance use disorder, occurring during the perinatal period. Newborn health was measured as low birth weight, low gestational age, prenatal exposure to noxious substances, neonatal drug withdrawal syndrome, fetal alcohol syndrome, and respiratory conditions, among others. Our identification strategy relied on a DID design that exploited the staggered implementation of MMLs and RMLs across states and years. DID coefficients were estimated with a variety of established and novel estimators, including static two-way fixed effects, dynamic event study, and the heterogeneity robust multiperiod estimator (de Chaisemartin and d’Haultfoeuille, 2020). We extended our analysis to consider treatment effect heterogeneity across subpopulations defined by maternal age, race and ethnicity, and health insurance. There is mounting evidence to suggest that the effects of marijuana liberalization may be heterogeneous across these subpopulations. Previous studies have documented higher marijuana use during pregnancy among mothers younger than 20 years old, non-Hispanic White and Black, and with Medicaid (van Gelder, Reefhuis, Caton, Werler, Druschel, Roeleveld, 2010, Haight, King, Bombard, Coy, Ferré, Grant, Ko, 2021, Ko, Farr, Tong, Creanga, Callaghan, 2015, Mark, Desai, Terplan, 2016). Evidence suggests that birth outcomes vary across these demographics as well (Shi et al., 2021). Additionally, we extended our analysis to consider the time when medical and recreational marijuana dispensaries became operational, as prior research suggests that legalization by itself may be an inadequate measure of access (Pacula et al., 2015).====Our study contributes to the growing literature on marijuana liberalization policies in three important ways. First, we focused on pregnant women and their newborns, a vulnerable population frequently cited in debates around marijuana liberalization but for which empirical evidence is currently lacking (Office of the Surgeon General, 2019). More broadly, there is scant research on RMLs due to their relative recentness. As RMLs proliferate, generating empirical evidence is important for informing future legislation. This study provides the first population-level estimates of the association between RMLs and perinatal health. Second, conducting research on the effects of state policies on illegal substance use during pregnancy is challenging due to a lack of large, representative data with reliable measures of illegal substance use in this population. Existing data are either based on a single state, on small sample sizes which hinder analyses of low-frequency outcomes, or on self-reported measures of illegal substance use that are known to suffer from underreporting (Beatty, Svikis, Ondersma, 2012, Mark, Desai, Terplan, 2016, Young-Wolff, Tucker, Alexeeff, Armstrong, Conway, Weisner, Goler, 2017). Underreporting might be especially significant for pregnant women, who could face legal consequences with child protective services in states that consider prenatal drug use child abuse or neglect (Krening and Hanson, 2018). We addressed these data challenges with HCUP-SID containing detailed health information for a near universe of hospitalizations in the 34 states for which we were able to obtain data.==== Substance use-related diagnostic codes in HCUP-SID were designated by healthcare providers during a patient’s hospital stay, and thus not self-reported. Notably, our outcomes captured intense maternal substance use which was most relevant for adverse perinatal health, as opposed to light to moderate use. Lastly, we applied a novel multiperiod DID estimator that corrects for bias arising from treatment effect heterogeneity in often used two-way fixed effects DID estimators and conducted a simulation to show that the estimator’s standard errors may allow for inference in the presence of a small number of treated clusters (de Chaisemartin and d’Haultfoeuille, 2020).====Using the multiperiod DID estimator, we found that the proportion of maternal hospitalizations involving marijuana use disorder increased by 23% (0.3 percentage points) in the first three years after RML implementation, with larger proportional effects among pregnant women who were 21 to 44 years old, White or Hispanic, Medicaid beneficiaries, or lived in states authorizing commercial sales of marijuana. This growth was accompanied by a 7% (0.4 percentage points) decline in the proportion of maternal hospitalizations involving tobacco use disorder. There was no significant effect of RMLs on the proportion of maternal hospitalizations involving opioid, stimulant, alcohol, or any substance use disorder. RMLs were not associated with statistically significant changes in newborn outcomes. We found no association between MML implementation and perinatal health outcomes, and can rule out proportional increases as small as 2.7% (0.2 percentage points) in low gestational age, 3.5% (0.2 percentage points) in low birth weight, and 0.95% (0.1 percentage points) in respiratory conditions. In absolute numbers, our findings implied modest or no adverse effects of marijuana liberalization policies on the array of perinatal health outcomes considered. We caution that our findings reflect the association between ==== and perinatal health, and therefore should not be interpreted as reflecting an epidemiological association between ==== and perinatal health, do not reflect all outcomes that could be affected by marijuana liberalization policies, and need not generalize to all subpopulations.====The paper proceeds as follows.

We derive an explicit formula of the maximal number of feasible ","Every year in the world hundreds and thousands patients of severe kidney disease need kidney transplants. The difficulty of having suitable kidney transplants arises in three major aspects. Firstly, there is a significant shortage of kidneys from deceased donors. For instance, in the United States in 2017 more than 92,000 patients were waiting for kidney transplants and only about 14,077 received transplants from deceased donors and 5,536 received transplants from living donors. While in waiting, over 4,000 patients passed away and about 4,414 were getting too sick to have a transplant and were therefore removed from the waiting list (see the USA OPTN/SRTR annual report by (Hart, 2017)). Secondly, a patient may receive a kidney from a living donor who can be a family member, a relative, or a friend. In this case the patient and the donor are called a patient-donor pair, and the patient is a paired patient and the donor a paired donor. But the patient may not be compatible with the donor and therefore is unable to use the kidney directly because of blood or tissue incompatibility. Kidney transplants can be conducted in two ways: The first is called ==== which involves typically several incompatible patient-donor pairs and refers to a process in which, say two pairs, the 1st paired patient receives a compatible kidney from the 2nd paired donor, and the 2nd paired patient receives a compatible kidney from the 1st paired donor. The other is ==== which involves an altruistic donor, patient-donor pairs, and a patient on the waiting list and is a process in which the 1st paired patient if any receives a compatible kidney from an altruistic donor, the 2nd paired patient receives a compatible kidney from the 1st paired donor, etc, and finally the patient on the waiting list receives a compatible kidney from the last paired donor. ==== ==== means a cycle or a chain of exchange involving ==== patients and ==== donors. Thirdly, although most people have one more kidney than they need, it is almost universally illegal to buy or sell a kidney.====The operation of a suitable kidney transplant must satisfy three basic constraints. The first are two medical constraints: the patient must be both blood-compatible and tissue-compatible with the donor. The second is the incentive constraint. The incentive issue arises when it involves patient-donor pairs. If a paired patient is incompatible with his/her paired donor, the patient need to exchange one kidney for another. Then the order of implementing kidney transplant becomes crucial to incentive-compatible exchange. To avoid the moral hazard caused by the ordering, exchanges between the two pairs must be carried out simultaneously. Because transplants are performed simultaneously, four simultaneous surgical treatments are required for two pair exchanges. The third is the capacity constraint. In practice there is a limit to the number of possible kidney transplants in each hospital. It is desirable to have short chains or cycles of exchange.====Kidney exchange has been previously studied by medical researchers (see Rapaport, 1986, Ross, Rubin, Siegler, Josephson, Thistlethwaite, Woodle, 1997, Ross, Woodle, 2000, Zenios, Woodle, Ross, 2001, etc). Roth et al. (2004) initialized economic analysis of kidney exchange, stimulating considerable interest in the subject. They proposed an efficient and incentive compatible mechanism extending the top trading cycle procedure from Shapley and Scarf (1974); see also Abdulkadiroǧlu and Sönmez (1999) for a related mechanism. In this case cycles and chains could be long. Roth et al. (2007a) considered a simpler but more practical model where patients are indifferent between compatible kidneys and prefer compatible kidneys to incompatible ones, i.e., patients have dichotomous preferences. Their model consists of multiple incompatible patient-donor pairs. They proved that using two-way and three-way cycles could significantly increase the number of possible exchanges, and at most four-way cycles suffice to capture all potential gains of exchange. Roth et al. (2007a) and Saidman et al. (2006) provided simulation results using the USA OPTN/SRTR data from 1993 to 2002.====In this paper we generalize the model of Roth et al. (2007a) by allowing all possible exchanges among incompatible, compatible patient-donor pairs, (altruistic) single donors (decreased or living), and patients on the waiting list and making the model closer to the reality. Our aim is to explore ways of maximizing the number of feasible kidney transplants. Because the model of Roth et al. (2007a) consists of only incompatible patient-donor pairs, only cycles of exchange will be needed. In our model, both cycles and chains of exchange will be needed. We derive for each case of ====-way exchange, ====, an explicit formula of the maximal number of feasible kidney transplants and propose a procedure to find efficient allocations of kidney transplants. We show that two-way cycles and chains of exchange can gain most of efficient exchange, three-ways can still make a visible effect and at most four-ways will be sufficient to capture all potential gains of exchange. This demonstrates that the key insights of Roth et al. (2007a) still hold for the current more general model, although the analysis inevitably becomes substantially more involved and complicated.====We further prove that in every ====-way ==== of exchange, each cycle contains at most two blood-type compatible pairs and each chain comprises at most one blood-type compatible pair. We provide substantial simulation results based on two data sets from the USA OPTN/SRTR from 1993 to 2002 (see Table 3) and from 1995 to 2016 (see Table 4). The second data set covers a longer period of time with more and better information than those collected in the first set. We highlight two important findings: Firstly, we find that under at most three-way exchanges allowing compatible pairs to exchange with incompatible pairs can have at least 10% net increase of feasible kidney transplants and that allowing both compatible pairs and single donors to exchange with incompatible pairs can have at least ==== net increase of feasible kidney transplants (see Table 8). This net increase of possible kidney transplants is very significant, meaning that many more patients can be saved when both compatible pairs and single donors are allowed to exchange with incompatible pairs. Secondly, our simulations clearly indicate that as the number of incompatible patient-donor pairs in the population reaches 100, the slope of matching rates (in percentage) of incompatible paired patients getting transplants becomes almost flat, albeit slightly upwards. This has some novel policy implication: Kidney exchange can be decentralized in the sense that in a country with a relatively large population, separate kidney exchange programs/centers can be established in several major regions. This means that patients and donors can have kidney transplant operations in their own regional or nearby center and save their traveling cost and time and that medical resources can be evenly distributed across the country and need not be concentrated in one place.====Furthermore, we propose a general and abstract model of two-category type-compatible exchanges and prove that it is sufficient to fully achieve efficiency by using only ====-way cycles and chains of exchange where ==== is the number of the primary types and is independent of the number of secondary types. In the context of kidney exchange, primary types in the first category correspond to blood types and have only four types and secondary types in the second category correspond to the classification of tissue types and can vary from one country to another. This abstract model has extended the general model of Roth et al. (2007a) and could have applications beyond kidney exchange.====We conclude this introduction by briefly reviewing several other related studies. Ross and Woodle (2000) suggested the idea of allowing compatible pairs to exchange with incompatible pairs. Roth et al. (2005a) examined a model with both compatible and incompatible pairs under two-way exchanges and dichotomous preferences and developed constrained-efficient and strategy-proof procedures. Sönmez and Ünver (2014) studied a similar model under two-way exchange by exploring the structure of Pareto-efficient kidney transplants via the Gallai-Edmonds theorem from graph theory and also conducting comparative static analysis. Roth et al. (2005b) and Gentrya et al. (2007) discussed the issue of kidney paired donation with compatible pairs and provided some simulation results; see Roth et al. (2007b) for some historical aspect. Unver (2010) studied efficient kidney exchanges in a dynamic environment in which agents arrive according to a stochastic Poisson process. Yılmaz (2011) characterized an efficient and egalitarian two-way exchange mechanism involving paired donations and list exchanges. Nicoló and Rodríguez-Álvarez (2012) presented a model with match quality and patients’ preferences. They proposed an efficient and truthful two-way exchange mechanism. Sönmez and Ünver (2013) offered a survey on the subject.====Ausubel and Morrill (2014) observed that incentive compatibility for kidney exchange requires only kidney donation to occur no later than the associated kidney receipt. They showed that sequential exchanges can increase the number of beneficial exchanges. Bilgel and Galle (2015) examined financial incentives for kidney donation by using a synthetic control method; see also Roth et al. (2007a) for competitive compensation. Nicoló and Rodríguez-Álvarez (2017) studied a model in which patients prefer kidneys from compatible younger donors to kidneys from older ones. They proposed sequential two-way exchange rules being individually rational, strategy-proof and non-bossy. Biró et al. (2019) and Sönmez et al. (2019) explored ways of incentivizing compatible pairs to participate in exchanges with incompatible pairs. Agarwal et al. (2019) reported market failure in kidney exchange and offered some remedy. Andersson and Kratz (2020) introduced a model of kidney exchange that tries to relax the traditional blood type compatibility. In their model, every patient prefers a fully acceptable donor to any donor who is not fully acceptable, and yet prefers an acceptable donor to any unacceptable donor. They showed that more efficiency can be made with also supporting simulation results. See Chun et al. (2015) and Sönmez et al. (2018) for independent related studies.====This paper is organized as follows. The model and basic concepts are introduced in Section 2.

Many developing countries experienced increased economic growth stemming from a rapid export-led industrialization and integration into the world economy. With improved living standards and access to health care, mortality from infectious diseases considerably declined, whereas mortality from chronic diseases, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, is increasing at alarming rates (WHO, 2018). The rise in these “lifestyle” diseases is associated with tobacco use, physical inactivity, excessive use of alcohol, and unhealthy diets. To the extent that globalization promotes economic growth, it is possible that a population’s health benefits from integration. However, understanding the distributional effects of trade liberalization remains a challenge.====This paper investigates the effect of a trade-induced negative shock to manufacturing employment on leading causes of mortality—diabetes, ischemic heart disease, and alcohol-related liver disease—in Mexican municipalities between 1998 and 2013. The country experienced a rapid export-led expansion of its manufacturing sector, an important source of formal employment creation, that started with its entry into GATT in 1986 and culminated with the signing of NAFTA in 1994. China’s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001 generates plausibly exogenous variation in international competition affecting Mexican local labor markets and allows for exploring differential mortality responses to changes in local employment opportunities and income. I exploit cross-municipality variation in trade exposure given the differences in industry specialization before China’s accession to the WTO in 2001, and construct measures of exposure to both import competition in Mexico’s domestic market and export competition in the U.S. market.====A priori, it is unclear how a negative economic shock may affect these “lifestyle” diseases morbidity and mortality. On the one hand, falls in income may limit households’ access to nutritious food and health care (Allcott et al., 2019, Barham, Rowberry, 2013, Behrman and Parker, 2011). On the other hand, a negative income shock could improve health to the extent alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs are normal goods (Lang, McManus, Schaur, 2018, Ruhm, 2005, Ruhm, Black, 2002). While job loss could improve the physical health of individuals employed in industries imposing strenuous physical activity or prone to work-place injuries (Hummels et al., 2019, Mcmanus, Schaur, 2016), it could also deteriorate mental health because of increased stress, anxiety levels, and overall sense of “despair” (Adda, Fawaz, 2020, Colantone, Crinò, Ogliari, 2019, Pierce, Schott, 2020). Finding sources of exogenous variation in income and health behaviors is challenging. In the first part of the paper, I combine data from economic and population censuses with international trade flows to estimate the effect of trade-induced changes in local labor opportunities on mortality. I focus on three leading causes of death, which explain about one third of overall mortality in Mexico, with the aim to provide an insight into channels that affect the prevalence of chronic disease, such as the relationship between income and nutrition, access to health care, and health behaviors.====Diabetes, a chronic disease associated with high blood glucose levels, affects 14 percent of Mexican adults and is the leading cause of death over the period of my analysis (PAHO, 2012, WHO, 2015). Type 2 diabetes is the most common type and is largely the result of excess body weight and physical inactivity. I find that the trade-induced loss in manufacturing employment opportunities at the municipality level is associated with a significant increase in the type 2 diabetes age-adjusted mortality rate. This result is not driven by pre-existing trends in diabetes mortality rate, and it is robust to the inclusion of a rich set of municipality-level controls. An interquartile shift in municipalities’ exposure to international competition is associated with a relative increase of 1.5 to 2 deaths per 100,000 people caused by type 2 diabetes. These changes represent a 9 to 12 percent increase on average with respect to the average age-adjusted diabetes mortality rate across municipalities at baseline. My estimates explain 14 to 19 percent of the average increase in mortality caused by type 2 diabetes over 1998–2003 (10.87 deaths per 100,000 people), and 8 to 10 percent of the average increase over 1998–2013 (20.42 deaths per 100,000).====I also examine whether two other leading causes of mortality, ischemic heart disease (i.e., heart attacks) and alcohol-related liver disease, were affected by the labor market disruption. I find that moving a municipality from the 25th to the 75th percentile of exposure to international competition is associated with a 1 to 2 percent decline (====0.6 to ====0.9 deaths per 100,000 people) in ischemic heart disease age-adjusted mortality rates and a 2 to 4 percent decline (====1.02 to ====1.82 deaths per 100,000 people) over 1998–2013, although these changes are somewhat imprecisely estimated. I do not find any evidence of statistically significant changes in alcohol-related liver disease mortality as a consequence of trade exposure.====I examine whether differing gender and age risk profiles explain the heterogeneous mortality response I find. While the increase in type 2 diabetes mortality associated with the negative employment shock affects both men and women, the decrease in mortality rates from ischemic heart disease is concentrated in men. I also study the effect of trade liberalization on other leading causes of mortality, some of which bear similar risk factors to type 2 diabetes and ischemic heart disease. I find declines in chronic pulmonary disease mortality and increases in hypertensive heart disease mortality in municipalities with higher exposure to the negative manufacturing shock. These results suggest that the factors driving these deaths are affected differently by the negative employment shock; my complementary evaluation of health surveys links each of the above results to specific health behaviors.====My identification strategy highlights the importance of labor market opportunities and income as determinants of health outcomes. In the second part of the paper, I provide additional supporting evidence on the relationship between income and households’ investment in health inputs. First, using data from individual health surveys, I show that trade exposure is associated with a 4 percent increase in the state-level prevalence of obesity (measured using body mass index) and a decline in physical activity, which are risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Results also point to significantly less access to preventive health check-ups, which might affect information availability through delayed diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Declines in alcohol and tobacco consumption are possible mechanisms explaining ischemic heart disease mortality declines and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease mortality declines.====Second, I provide evidence of the effect of trade exposure on the local labor market. The negative trade-induced shock to manufacturing labor demand, measured at municipality level, is associated with wage reductions and increased levels of informality at the local level. I show that differential wage reductions are concentrated in the manufacturing sector in the short term and expand to the overall economy in the long term, implying some sectoral adjustment takes place over time. Additionally, more-exposed municipalities have fewer individuals with health insurance, which is explained by a differential reduction in the share of beneficiaries enrolled in social security through formal employment. Given that I find overall declines in formal employment at the local level, this result implies the loss of access to health care was not limited to manufacturing workers.====This paper makes two main contributions. First, I identify the impact of trade liberalization on chronic disease mortality through its influence on income and employment opportunities. Thus, I provide evidence of a new dimension of the relationship between globalization and inequality in developing countries (Braga, 2018, Dix-Carneiro, Kovak, 2017, Pavcnik, 2017, Topalova, 2010). Distinct from recent work, which focuses on the trade in foods and prices (Giuntella, Rieger, Rotunno, 2020, Gracner, 2021) as determinants of state-level chronic disease prevalence, my empirical strategy allows me to analyze the income effects of trade exposure as a channel affecting health outcomes. Using mortality data from national registries allows me to identify these effects at a smaller spatial unit (i.e., municipality level).====Second, I take advantage of the level of disaggregation and geographical coverage of my data to explore whether the effects of trade-induced worker displacement on mortality are different depending on the source of international competition. Previous research studying the impact of Chinese international competition in Mexican labor market outcomes focuses either on the direct effect via a rise in import competition in the domestic market (Blyde, Busso, Faggioni, Romero, Majlesi, Narciso, 2018, Mendez, 2015) or the indirect effect via a reduction of exports to the United States (Dell, Feigenberg, Teshima, 2019, Gallagher, Moreno-Brid, Porzecanski, 2008, Gallagher, Porzecanski, 2007, Hanson, Robertson, 2008, Utar, Torres Ruiz, 2013). Examining exposure to both types of international competition and using countrywide data is relevant for drawing conclusions regarding distributional implications of trade liberalization. I find that the effects of trade-induced job loss on mortality are similar using either measure of exposure to international competition. Furthermore, the results are robust to a rich set of municipality-level controls—migration pre-trends, employment pre-trends, gender composition, educational distribution, and rural/urban status.====More broadly, my analysis relates to several important literatures. An extensive literature has investigated the health and mortality consequences of unemployment. Following the seminal contribution by Ruhm (2000), which reports a pro-cyclical fluctuation of mortality in the United States, a series of influential papers study the effect of economic conditions on mortality (Autor, Dorn, Hanson, 2019, Ruhm, 2015, Sullivan, Wachter, 2009), workplace injuries (Boone, Van Ours, Wuellrich, Zweimüller, 2011, Mcmanus, Schaur, 2016) and self-reported health outcomes (Hummels et al., 2019, Lang, McManus, Schaur, 2018). Additionally, a recent strand of literature focuses on the deaths of despair—drug overdoses, suicides, and alcohol-related liver mortality—as the main driver of the overall increase in all-cause mortality in the U.S. in the last two decades (Case, Deaton, 2015, Case, Deaton, 2017, Hollingsworth, Ruhm, Simon, 2017, Pierce, Schott, 2020). I exploit exogenous variation in trade exposure at the local level for identification and to shed light into the mechanisms behind this relationship in a middle-income country like Mexico.====Finally, my analysis also relates to an extensive literature examining the effect of Chinese international competition on labor market outcomes in the last two decades (Acemoglu, Autor, Dorn, Hanson, Price, 2016, Autor, Dorn, Hanson, 2013, Autor, Dorn, Hanson, Song, 2014, Pierce, Schott, 2016, Utar, 2018), as well as an array of socio-economic outcomes such as marriage and fertility (Autor, Dorn, Hanson, Autor, Dorn, Hanson, 2019), internal migration (Greenland, Lopresti, Mchenry, 2019, Majlesi, Narciso, 2018), women’s decision making power (Majlesi, 2016) and opportunity cost of criminal employment (Dell et al., 2019). Here, using a similar identification strategy, my results contribute to a better understanding of the implications of international trade exposure on mortality in a developing country.====This paper proceeds as follows.

These refugees left a country where the ","Millions of people worldwide are forced to leave their country or region of residence due to military conflicts and natural disasters. According to the recent numbers provided by the UNHCR (2020), there are 70.8 million forcibly displaced people in the world, of which 41.3 million are internally displaced, 25.9 million are refugees,==== and 3.5 million are asylum-seekers. Due to the civil war that has been going on since 2011, Syria is currently the top source country of refugees (6.7 million refugees), and its northern neighbor, Turkey, is the top refugee-hosting country (3.7 million refugees as of 2020).==== In this study, we examine the effects of the Syrian refugees in Turkey on the health care resources and the mortality outcomes of natives, focusing on neonatal, infant, child, and elderly mortality as of the end of 2017.====Forced migration has important implications for the communities that host the migrants, as well as for the people that move.==== A growing literature examines the impact of immigration on native health in the context of economic migrants in developed countries (see, e.g., Belles-Obrero et al. (2021), Giuntella et al. (2018, 2019), Dillender and McInnerney (2020)). However, very little evidence exists on the impact of displaced people on the health outcomes of the communities in the hosting regions,==== although the effects of forced migration on the health outcomes of migrants have been studied more often.==== Moreover, the literature on the link between refugee influxes and health outcomes in the hosting regions has primarily established associations rather than causal relationships. Among the very few studies that establish a causal relationship, Montalvo and Reynal-Querol (2007) show that mass population movement from a country with high prevalence of malaria has a significant impact on the number of malaria cases in the refugee hosting countries,==== and Ibanez and Rozo (2020) find that forced migration of Venezuelans to Colombia caused a higher incidence of certain infectious diseases in the host country. Baez (2011) examines the health effects of the massive migration in 1994 from Burundi and Rwanda to the region of Kagera in Tanzania. Using Demographic and Health Surveys, Baez estimates the causal effects of refugee intensity on a rich set of health outcomes of local children and finds a 7-percentage-point increase in child mortality. Certainly, more research is needed to understand the causal effect of the refugee shocks on the health outcomes of hosting communities.====As a result of the war that started in Syria in 2011, 3.4 million Syrian refugees arrived in Turkey as of the end of 2017. The war caused substantial destruction of the health infrastructure in Syria. During the war, many internally displaced Syrians were subject to epidemic diseases, including hepatitis A, typhoid fever, and cholera and non-communicable ones due to poor sanitary conditions (WHO, 2013; Petersen et al., 2013; Cousins, 2015). Moreover, these diseases posed a risk to neighboring countries as internally displaced people started arriving there. WHO (2013), Leblebicioglu (2016), and Ekmekci (2017) report incidences of infectious diseases in Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, and Turkey.====Turkey has universal health coverage for its citizens and has implemented a generous health care policy toward Syrian refugees. Turkey's universal health coverage, which gives access to public primary, secondary, and tertiary health care services free of charge, has been extended to cover registered Syrian refugees in the same way as native residents. Unregistered Syrian refugees can use preventive and emergency services for free. Most Syrian refugees are registered as this allows them to use all health and education services of the state and is a precondition for receiving Emergency Social Safety Net (ESSN) cash transfers.====The arrival of refugees could impact natives’ health outcomes via several channels. First, the arrival of such a high number of refugees means that there will be more potential patients per health care resources in the absence of investment in these resources.==== Maternal and infant health service provision could especially be affected due to the high birth rates of Syrian refugees. According to the 2018 Turkish Demographic Health Survey, the fertility rate of Syrian women is 5.3 compared to 2.3 for native women. Poor health conditions of refugee mothers imply that their infants could also face adverse health consequences.==== Second, Syrian refugees faced certain infectious diseases during their exodus and arrived in Turkey with them. In fact, as reported above, certain disease outbreaks took place in Turkey. Third, the arrival of refugees could affect native health indirectly through their economic impact.====This paper focuses on natives’ neonatal, infant, child, and elderly mortality because these are the most vulnerable groups. The high fertility rate of Syrian refugees could put a disproportionate strain on the health system for infants and children.==== For instance, they could cause congestion at neonatal intensive care bed units for the most vulnerable infants.==== Although Turkey has significantly lowered its infant and child mortality in the last 30 years, they remain significantly above those in high-income countries. In 2011, before the refugees started arriving, the infant mortality rate in Turkey was 13.9 per 1000 births compared to 4.9 in high-income countries. The quality of health care resources in Turkey in terms of human resources (doctors, nurses, and midwives per capita) and physical resources (hospital beds per capita, etc.), as well as health expenditures per capita, is similar to those in other middle-income countries, but significantly below that in high-income countries.====For our empirical analysis, we combine several administrative data sources. Mortality data for the 2009–17 period come from Turkey's Central Civil Registration System (which was initiated in 2009). The data on reasons for mortality are drawn from the Death Notification System (DNS) of Turkey. All mortality data in this study cover only the permanent residents of Turkey, hence exclude the refugees. We also use data on the human and physical resources of the health system provided by the Turkish Ministry of Health. We combine these data sources with data on province-level characteristics over time obtained from the Turkish Statistical Institute (Turkish Statistical Institute TurkStat, 2018). To identify the impact of the migrant shock on these health outcomes, we exploit the provincial variation in the ratio of refugees to natives in a difference-in-differences regression. Since this variation across provinces could be endogenous due to refugees’ choice of settlement patterns, we use an instrumental variable strategy. Our instrument depends on the total number of Syrian refugees in four neighboring countries (Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and Iraq) in each year, pre-war population shares of Syrian provinces, the distance of each Syrian province to the closest border entry in each of the neighboring countries, and the distance of each Syrian province to each Turkish province. Hence, it accounts for the potential endogeneity in the level and timing of the arrival of refugees in Turkey.====Our results show that refugees’ arrival put significant pressure on the health care resources—despite the Turkish government's investment in certain resources. The government increased the number of nurses, pediatricians, and hospital beds in the hosting regions. However, this was insufficient to keep all resources per person (native and refugee) at the levels before the refugee influx. The numbers of doctors, midwives, hospitals, and adult intensive care beds decline in per-capita terms. Moreover, the magnitude of this decline is significant in some cases. For instance, we estimate that a 10 percentage-point increase in the refugee-to-native ratio decreases the number of doctors per person by about 9 percent.====In terms of the impact of the refugee shock on natives’ mortality, the OLS estimates provide suggestive evidence that the refugee shock increases neonatal, infant and child mortality. However, this results from the endogenous settlement patterns of refugees; the 2SLS estimates indicate no evidence of the migrant shock on neonatal, infant, child, or elderly mortality. This implies that refugees are more likely to settle in provinces for which, in the absence of the refugee shock, mortality outcomes would exhibit a more negative trend over time.====This study is one of the few to examine the impact of a massive refugee shock on natives’ health outcomes in a low- or middle-income country (in addition to Baez (2011) and Ibanez and Rozo (2020)). The context of Baez (2011) is different: a low-income country with limited health care resources. Although Ibanez and Rozo (2020) examine the effect of forced migrants also in a middle-income country, the natives’ health outcomes they use are different (infectious diseases). While Baez (2011) finds a negative impact of the refugee shock on child mortality in a low-income country, we find no evidence of such an adverse effect in a middle-income country despite the bigger magnitude of the refugee shock and more variation in the key variable of interest.==== Our results imply that the health care resources of a middle-income country—despite the evidence on the worsening of several health inputs in per-capita terms due to the arrival of refugees—were able to cope much better with the refugee shock.====This study also contributes to the broader literature on the impact of immigration on native health (Belles-Obrero et al. (2021), Dillender and McInnerney (2020), Giuntella (2012), Giuntella and Mazzonna (2015), Giuntella et al. (2018, 2019), Orrenius and Zavodny (2009, 2012)). This literature is mainly in the context of economic migrants in developed countries, where the effect of migrants on natives’ health generally results from the change in the type (and hence physical burden and safety) of jobs for natives with the arrival of migrants. Our contribution to this literature is that we examine the effect of forced migrants on native health in the context of the largest refugee group in a single country in the world. Our context is also different from those in the economic migrant contexts in that the massive migration flow took place in a relatively short period of time. Hence, we would expect the supply of medical resources to be relatively more inelastic.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section provides background information.

Fourteen of these states require women to make an additional trip to the facility so that this consultation can be done in person (Guttmacher Institute, 2019a). Proponents of mandatory waiting periods (MWPs) argue that they ensure women receive information about pregnancy and abortion and that they have ample time to weigh their options before deciding to terminate a pregnancy. Others have argued that women requesting abortion are already making informed decisions without the MWP; therefore, these laws impose an unnecessary burden that has the potential to delay or prevent women from accessing abortion care. In particular, women may have difficulty making arrangements for transportation, time off work, child care, or paying for any additional costs associated with the consultation appointment.==== In addition, requiring a separate consultation appointment for all women seeking an abortion may present logistical challenges for providers thereby reducing the number of women they can serve—as a result, women may experience difficulties obtaining an appointment from their preferred provider.====Together, these issues suggest that a MWP may cause delays for women seeking abortions because of: (i) the mandatory wait time after their first appointment; (ii) any additional wait time for appointments due to capacity constraints at facilities; (iii) and any extra time it takes them to make arrangements for another trip to a facility. Any such delays are particularly important because they can limit the types of procedures available which depend on gestational age, and because monetary costs and health risks tend to be higher as gestational age increases.==== The same set of issues suggest that a MWP may ==== some women from obtaining abortions if: (i) they are unable to make arrangements for an additional trip; (ii) the delays push them beyond the maximum gestational age for an abortion; or (iii) the consultation and/or waiting period changes beliefs or preferences. On the other hand, such effects could be mitigated to some degree if forward-looking women who know they are pregnant and know they may want an abortion begin to make arrangements more quickly in anticipation of these obstacles. It is also possible that barriers to abortion access could change other behaviors that mitigate the risk of pregnancy, such as the use of contraception, but prior work has found minimal evidence of such effects (Fischer et al., 2018).====Ultimately, understanding the effects of MWPs on abortion timing and abortion rates requires careful empirical analysis. Notably, a 2009 review of the evidence found just seven studies of the impacts of MWPs on abortion rates and/or abortion timing, and only four of these used approaches that are typically thought to be credible for identifying causal effects (Joyce et al., 2009). Those four studies focused on the effects of MWPs in early-adopting states through the mid-1990s. To our knowledge, no new papers estimating the causal effects of MWPs have been written since. Thus, the evidence base arguably has become dated.====More recent evidence on the effects of MWPs is particularly important because these effects may be different in today’s context, given the major changes in the landscape for women seeking an abortion. One major change is that the number of abortion providers has declined dramatically in many states. Thus, a restriction requiring women to make a second trip to a clinic may involve more travel today than it would have in the past. Another key difference is that the nearest out-of-state provider likely would not have had a MWP for women in early-adopting states. Today it is less likely that a woman can avoid the MWP by driving to her nearest out-of-state provider; most states have a MWP, and these states are clustered geographically (as shown in Figure 1). These two features of the current landscape imply that many women would have to travel farther today to avoid their states’ MWP laws than in years past. While these factors suggest that MWPs may have a greater impact today, it is possible that their effects may be smaller, perhaps because of changes in access to transportation, improved information on navigating the process of obtaining an abortion, or for other reasons. Regardless, given the massive changes in the abortion landscape since the 1990s, including a surge in legislation since 2011,==== we believe it is important to expand on the existing base of knowledge by documenting the effects of MWPs enacted in recent years.====Towards this end, we evaluate the effect of Tennessee’s MWP, which went into effect in 2015 and requires women to wait at least 48 hours after getting in-person counseling from a physician before they can obtain an abortion. With the enactment of this law, Tennessee joined its neighboring states with similar laws on the books. To evaluate causal effects, we use both a difference-in-differences approach and a synthetic control design comparing changes over time for residents of Tennessee to changes over time in two sets of comparison states. We focus on the share of women obtaining abortions in the second trimester of their pregnancy and on abortion rates.====Our difference-in-differences and synthetic-control estimates indicate that Tennessee’s MWP caused a 53–69 percent increase in the share of abortions obtained in the second trimester, completely or almost completely closing the pre-existing gap between women residing Tennessee and women living in the comparison states (approximately 5 percentage points). We highlight the statistical significance of this estimate through permutation tests indicating that no state in the comparison group experienced such a large increase relative to other states. Our analyses of the second-trimester abortion rate indicate that the MWP increased the number of number women having such abortions, though these estimates are not always statistically significant at conventional levels. Our analysis of the overall abortion rate yields suggestive evidence of reductions caused by the MWP though these analyses should be viewed with more caution because of limited statistical power. We also find suggestive evidence that effects on delays are larger in relatively disadvantaged counties.====Motivated by our findings indicating that Tennessee’s MWP led to significant delays in abortion, we provide a number of back-of-the-envelope calculations of the additional monetary costs of the MWP to provide these findings some additional context. We conservatively estimate that the additional consultation appointment increased women’s monetary costs by $173–256 accounting for fees charged by providers, transportation costs, and lost wages or childcare. We also estimate that a delay of one week, which can alter the procedure type and the clinics available to a woman, can increase the monetary cost of obtaining an abortion by up to a total of over $502.",New Evidence on the Effects of Mandatory Waiting Periods for Abortion,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629621001181,16 September 2021,2021,Research Article,114.0

We consider three types of expectations. Myopic patients choose a hospital based on current variables alone, forward-looking but naïve patients consider the future but assume that quality remains constant, and forward-looking and rational patients foresee the evolution of quality. We rank quality provision and show that it is higher under naïve than myopic expectations, while quality under rational expectations may be highest or lowest. This result also holds for patients’ health gains, suggesting that rationality may hurt patients. Additionally, policies to reduce switching costs lead to lower quality, possibly unless patients are rational and cost substitutability between output and quality is sufficiently strong. Finally, we show how optimal price regulation depends on expectations and switching costs.","Motivated by the observation that patients tend to choose a hospital and repeatedly demand treatment from it, even during unrelated episodes of care, recent empirical literature provides evidence of demand inertia in hospital markets (Irace, 2018, Jung, Feldman, Scanlon, 2011, Raval, Rosenbaum, 2018, Shepard, 2016). Like travelling distance and quality of care, prior utilisation emerges as a key determinant of hospital choice, and its effect has been shown to result from persistent patient preferences and switching costs (Irace, 2018, Raval, Rosenbaum, 2018). Persistent preferences denote the time-invariant horizontal preferences some patients have for particular hospital characteristics. Absent significant changes in the market, and upon realising that their tastes or health needs have remained constant, repeated utilisation of the same hospital may be the optimal behaviour for these patients.====Preference persistence, however, does not fully explain the magnitude of demand inertia. Even when their preferences change, patients may still find it optimal to choose the same hospital repeatedly if switching is costly, and there is a variety of reasons why switching costs arise in hospital markets. First, there may be monetary and opportunity costs incurred by patients to have their medical records transferred to a new provider. Second, because evaluating hospital quality is a time-consuming and complex task, switching costs may reflect the risk of trying an untested, alternative provider. Third, switching costs might arise from the need to undergo duplicate procedures, such as diagnostic tests, when patients restart treatment after switching providers. Fourth, switching costs may also be the premium patients are willing to pay, either in terms of higher prices or lower quality, for familiarity with their chosen hospital. Switching costs, therefore, induce state dependence; i.e., a causal impact of current on future choices. If switching is costly, choosing a particular hospital in the present has an impact on the utility patients will derive from treatment at different hospitals in their choice set in the future, thereby affecting their current choice.====Both sources of demand inertia create a link between the choices of hospital patients make at different points in time. And if these choices are intertemporally linked, they are affected by whether patients anticipate the future and the degree of sophistication of their foresight—what we refer to as ====. Were patient preferences at different points in time completely independent and switching costs inexistent, meaning that there would be no intertemporal link, current choices would be unaffected by whether and how patients anticipate future ones. In other words, the role of patient expectations and demand inertia are inextricable.====In this article, we analyse a hospital market where switching costs and persistent horizontal patient preferences generate demand inertia and investigate how different types of patient expectations affect quality provision by two competing hospitals. If patients have rational expectations, they take the future into account and correctly assess the evolution of the determinants of their choices of hospital. In our framework, ==== patients anticipate that their preferences may change over time, are aware of the lock-in effect of switching costs, and foresee future quality. Regarding the last-mentioned aspect, these patients not only know that higher quality attracts demand in the present and that part of this demand will be locked-in, but also predict how this locked-in demand affects future quality provision. In turn, understanding the link between current and future quality, via demand, requires some knowledge of hospital treatment technology; more specifically, how demand affects the marginal cost of quality provision.====Departures from fully rational behaviour may occur because patients are present-biased or because they have incorrect beliefs about the link between current and future quality (Baicker et al., 2015). We look at present-bias by considering ==== patients, who ignore the future and base their choice of hospital on current observable variables only. We also look at incorrect beliefs about future quality by allowing for the possibility that patients are ====. In this case, the difference from full rationality lies not in whether patients anticipate the future but in how they do it. Similarly to forward-looking and rational patients, forward-looking but naïve ones anticipate the possibility of having persistent preferences and the existence of switching costs. They fail, however, in foreseeing future quality. Because predicting the evolution of hospital quality is cognitively complex or because the information required to carry out such a task is unavailable, these patients are naïve in the sense that they resort to the simple rule-of-thumb of expecting that quality will remain constant.====Our analytical framework is a two-period model where patients choose a hospital based on the level of quality offered, their horizontal preferences, and possibly a switching cost. In the second period, patients have either new or the same (horizontal) preferences as in the first period and incur a switching cost if they decide to demand treatment from the hospital they did not choose previously. In the first period, all patients are new in the market, implying that there are no switching costs and that horizontal preferences affect first-period utility only to the extent that they represent contemporaneous tastes. If patients are forward-looking, their choices are also conditioned on what might happen in the second period; namely, the possibility that their preferences may change and that they might want to switch (i.e., patients may see themselves tied to the ‘wrong’ hospital). It is, therefore, in the first period that patient expectations play a role in determining the demand for hospital care and hence in affecting the incentives for quality provision.====We allow quality and output to be either cost complements or cost substitutes for the hospitals. Higher quality by one of the hospitals yields a demand increase, which, owing to inertia, partially carries over into the future. If quality and output are cost substitutes (complements), this increases (reduces) the marginal cost of quality and hence weakens (strengthens) the incentives for quality provision. Thus, under cost substitutability (complementarity), a current unilateral quality increase by a particular hospital foreshadows lower (higher) relative quality by this hospital in the future. This link between present and future quality—and the fact that only rational patients foresee it—partly explain our results.====We show that patient expectations affect quality provision mainly through the responsiveness of demand to quality, with higher responsiveness leading to higher quality. While demand is always more responsive when patients are forward-looking but naïve than when they are myopic, demand responsiveness under rational expectations depends on the actual relationship between present and future quality. The more rational patients anticipate a current quality increase to be reversed in terms of the future quality difference, the less attracted by it these patients are. This is why demand responsiveness to quality is decreasing (increasing) in the degree of cost substitutability (complementarity) when patients are rational. Consequently, demand responsiveness ==== quality under rational expectations rank highest, lowest, or in between the cases of forward-looking but naïve and myopic expectations, depending on the degree of cost substitutability/complementarity. This first main result has important implications for patient utility. In a symmetric equilibrium, expectations affect aggregate patient utility uniquely through quality. Thus, when we rank quality according to the type of expectations, we are also ranking patient utility. This implies that full rationality does not necessarily make patients better off.====Our remaining results are policy-related. First, we investigate the effect of policies to reduce switching costs. Such policies affect the hospitals’ incentives for quality provision through two channels. On the one hand, the presence of switching costs implies that current demand is valuable in the future because it will be partially locked-in, which intensifies the competition for market share and hence leads to higher quality provision, all else equal. This effect is unambiguously weakened by a reduction in switching costs. On the other hand, there is an effect on demand responsiveness to quality, whose sign and magnitude is partly determined by patient expectations. Whereas a reduction in switching costs has no effect on demand responsiveness if patients are myopic, it makes demand less responsive to quality if patients are forward-looking but naïve, or if they have rational expectations and quality and output are cost complements. In all these cases, policies to reduce switching costs will unambiguously lead to lower quality provision. In fact, higher quality provision in response to lower switching costs ==== only occur under rational patient expectations and sufficiently strong cost substitutability.====Second, we characterise the prospective prices that maximise social welfare and show how they depend on patient expectations. Under uniform pricing, the price and switching costs are ==== for all types of patient expectations provided that the degree of cost substitutability between quality and output is not excessively strong. This implies that a reduction in switching costs should optimally be accompanied by a higher prospective price and ====. We also characterise the optimal prices under hospital-specific pricing, when demand is asymmetrically distributed between the two hospitals. We show that, for a moderate degree of cost substitutability, optimal pricing is likely to involve setting a higher price for the larger hospital regardless of patient expectations.====The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In the next section, we relate our study to several strands of literature. In Section 3, we present the model and, in Section 4, derive the equilibrium quality levels in the two-period game. Our primary analysis is given in Sections 5 and 6. In Section 5, we show how patient expectations affect equilibrium quality provision. Implications for policy are studied in Section 6.

The recent past has seen significant consolidation amongst plan providers, notable CVS's 2018 acquisition of Aetna and Cigna's 2018 acquisition of Express Scripts. In this paper, we analyze the effect of consolidation of standalone Part D plan providers on premiums using plausibly exogenous variation in concentration induced by the 2011 ","Around 45 million Americans are enrolled in Medicare Part D plans.==== These plans provide prescription drug coverage to seniors covered by the Medicare program.==== The existing evidence suggests that Part D plans have successfully negotiated lower prices for branded drugs and that this has helped contain costs (Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission, 2010, Duggan and Morton, 2010, Duggan and Scott Morton, 2011). Nevertheless, premiums have increased over time,==== and recent research has identified a number of challenges to the efficient working of the Medicare Part D program.==== Among these is the steady trend of insurer consolidation.==== In this paper, we analyze how insurer consolidation has affected Medicare Part D premiums and how market structure affects the likely impact of such consolidation.====We use the 2011 merger between CVS and Universal American to estimate the effect of increases in Part D plan sponsor concentration on premiums. In addition to providing novel evidence for the Medicare Part D market, our paper extends the previous literature in a few important ways. First, we allow the effect of concentration on premiums to vary with the level of concentration in a market. Structural models support such heterogeneous treatment effects,==== and a central premise of U.S. competition policy is that mergers are likely to be problematic primarily in markets that are moderately (or more) concentrated after the merger and see a significant increase in concentration.==== Despite the centrality of concentration thresholds in U.S. and international prospective merger analysis, there is a dearth of (reduced-form) empirical evidence that justifies them.==== Second, we are able to identify the impact of concentration on both within plan changes in premiums and average premiums in a market while also controlling for a rich set of plan and plan sponsor characteristics.==== Third, the data allows us to analyze non-price responses to an exogenous change in concentration. In particular, we find that the increase in concentration due to the 2011 merger between CVS and Universal American likely led to higher deductibles, fewer plan sponsors per market, and fewer plans.====The raw correlation between concentration and insurance premiums is unlikely to be causal. For example, high concentration may be correlated with low premiums if low-cost plan sponsors offer low-premium plans and consequently win a large market share. Such a relationship would not be causal but rather driven by (unobserved) heterogeneity in firms’ region-specific cost structure. Similarly, suppose costly (and desirable) quality improvements are not completely captured by covariates. Then, high-priced, high-quality plans may displace low-priced, low-quality plans, leading to a positive correlation between high prices and high concentration. Our identification strategy addresses these endogeneity concerns by relying on the local variation in concentration induced by a major national merger—CVS's acquisition of Universal American's Part D business on April 29, 2011—in the 34 prescription drug plan (PDP) regional markets.==== We employ two approaches to estimate the impact of the merger-induced change in concentration on premiums.====First, our instrumental variables (IV) approach estimates how changes in concentration induced by the merger affected premiums. We regress premiums on the change in the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), where we instrument for the HHI using the predicted change in the HHI based on pre-merger concentration, i.e., the change that would have occurred absent any other changes.==== We find that, on average, assuming a homogenous treatment effect, the increases in concentration caused by the merger increased PDP plan premiums by 1.5 percent across the regional PDP markets and 1.3 percent within plans. These findings imply an increase in total premiums paid by standalone PDP enrollees in the U.S. of $166 million per year or around $10 per enrollee (at pre-merger enrollment and premiums). This finding adds to a growing literature using plausibly exogenous merger-induced changes in competition to identify an average treatment effect,==== and is consistent with an emerging consensus that health insurer consolidation may degrade the benefits of privatization when concentration reaches high levels.==== Importantly, we find that the impact is long-lasting (more than five years) and that consolidation does not result in subsequent entry of plans or competitors.====Second, we also show that the estimated average price effects mask considerable heterogeneity in marginal price effects. We find economically and statistically significant increases in premiums in moderately (or more) concentrated markets that saw a significant increase in concentration==== and no significant changes in premiums in other markets.==== Allowing for heterogeneous treatment effects, we find that the merger increased premiums in moderately (or more) concentrated PDP markets that saw a significant increase in concentration by 3 percent but not at all in other markets. The implied impact of the merger-induced increase in concentration on total premiums paid by standalone PDP enrollees in the U.S. is $133 million per year or slightly less than $8 per enrollee (at pre-merger enrollment and premiums). However, this masks considerable heterogeneity across regions: the implied premium increase in highly concentrated regions about $20 per enrollee and year and no change in premiums in unconcentrated regions.====Our results provide evidence of heterogeneity in the impact of concentration on premiums and provide support for the use of concentration thresholds in prospective merger analysis by antitrust agencies. To further illustrate the importance of accounting for non-linearities in the impact of concentration on premiums, we analyze the implied price effect from the recent merger between CVS and Aetna had the U.S. Department of Justice not imposed a remedy. Our homogenous treatment effects model predicts that the CVS-Aetna merger, absent divestitures, would have led to Part D plan premiums increases of 4.2 percent (nearly $500 million per year). Our heterogeneous treatment effect model predicts an even larger premium increase of 5.2 percent (over $600 million per year).====Of course, the DOJ did impose a remedy on CVS and Aetna: it required that the merged firm divest Aetna's Part D lives and additional Part D assets to Wellcare.==== Our homogenous treatment effects model predicts that with the divestiture—which can be thought of as a merger between the Part D lives of Aetna and Wellcare—the merger will lead to an average price increase of only 0.9 percent. The heterogeneous treatment model suggests that the divestiture will be even more effective: it predicts no significant premium increase on average.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the data and the institutional setting. Section 3 provides OLS and IV estimates of the impact of increased concentration on premiums. Section 4 discusses evidence of heterogeneity in the treatment effect due to differences in market structure, and Section 5 simulates the predicted effects of the CVS-Aetna merger with and without divestitures.

Despite the fact that each of these diseases usually affects very few people, currently 7000 orphan diseases are described in the literature, and it is estimated that 25 to 30 million US citizens and 27 to 36 million EU residents suffer from an orphan disease (Health and Safety, 2015). However, treatment with a specific indication is available for less than 10% of known rare diseases (Melnikova, 2012, Tambuyzer, 2010).====The literature provides evidence of a positive correlation between innovation and market size.==== As a result, the low prevalence of orphan diseases often provides insufficient incentive for the private sector to invest in R&D. This has led several countries to introduce special legislation, starting from the approval of the Orphan Drug Act (ODA) in 1983 in the US. The typical toolkit includes both ==== incentives, such as market exclusivity, and ==== incentives, such as tax credits on R&D expenditure. Overall, there seems to be a general consensus that special regulations adopted around the world have contributed to closing the gap between orphan and non-orphan diseases. Braun et al. (2010), Lichtenberg and Waldfogel (2009) and Yin (2008) provide evidence of a positive impact of the ODA on R&D directed at orphan diseases. Similar evidence is provided by Westermark et al. (2011) for the EU.====Our study aims to go beyond the analysis of the aggregate impact of regulations on innovation for orphan versus non orphan diseases, and to investigate how they affect the distribution of additional R&D efforts within the class of orphan diseases. The main question we seek to answer is how the impact of incentives on R&D is affected by the prevalence of a disease. Indeed, some orphan diseases affect almost 100,000 individuals worldwide whilst others have recorded very few cases. We study theoretically how ==== and ==== incentives interact with market size in affecting the distribution of additional R&D efforts across different diseases. In doing this, we separate the intensive and extensive margin of investment. Empirically, we use data from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to investigate how the allocation of R&D within the class of orphan diseases changed over time, as incentives were strengthened due to the adoption of special legislation in additional geographic areas. Based on theoretical and empirical results, we draw policy implications suggesting possible directions for a revision of the incentive system aimed at addressing clinical needs that remain as yet unmet.====The disadvantage for rare diseases in terms of innovation has been studied both theoretically (Jobjörnsson et al., 2016) and empirically (Barrenho et al., 2019). Conti and Gruber (2020) present several motivations for the introduction of specific incentives aimed at addressing this scarcity of therapeutic options. Plausibly, one rationale is related to inequality aversion (McCabe et al., 2005), given the huge differences in the availability of treatments between rare and common diseases. The problem can also fit an equality of opportunity framework, given that disease prevalence is clearly beyond individual control (Roemer, 1998). Another possible rationale is related to a spillover effect: R&D for orphan diseases might generate scientific insights that are useful for the treatment of other diseases (Rodwell and Aymé, 2015).====The possibly heterogeneous impact of the incentives on different orphan diseases is extremely relevant, given the huge number of orphan diseases and the large variability in the level of research; this variability can be ascribed to differences in therapeutic class, prevalence, number of scientific publications (Heemstra, van Weely, Büller, Leufkens, de Vrueh, 2009, Pammolli, Riccaboni, Magazzini, 2009), and population affected, e.g. diseases with onset in childhood (Raïs Ali and Tubeuf, 2019). In the analysis by Yin (2008) on the effect of the ODA on the flow of clinical trials in the years immediately following its approval, differences in impact emerge when the prevalence of rare diseases is accounted for, with a smaller impact on most rare diseases.====Of the reasons to support R&D on orphan diseases at least two suggest that it is not only total effort that matters, but also how the effort is distributed across diseases. First, according to the ‘fair innings’ argument (Harris, 2006), all individuals should be allowed to achieve a minimum health status (e.g. in terms of life expectancy), meaning that gains by those who have not yet achieved this threshold should be valued more. This view is consistent with the objectives of European legislation==== and with robust evidence on individual preferences (e.g. Nord et al., 1995). The second argument is based on the insurance value of innovation. Ex ante, a new treatment can reduce the uninsurable physical risk for individuals who might get sick, by raising utility in the bad state of the world (Lakdawalla, Malani, Reif, 2017, Philipson, Zanjani, 2014). This insurance value increases with disease severity (Lakdawalla and Phelps, 2020). This also means that, in a hypothetical situation with a number of diseases that are equally severe if untreated, the incremental value of an innovation providing a given health gain is largest if it targets a disease with no existing therapeutic option.====The existence of a variety of incentives within orphan drug legislation also raises the question of which of them is best suited to achieve the intended objectives. Concerning the possibly different impact of ==== and ==== programs, the existing literature mainly focuses on the role of asymmetric information (see e.g., Kremer, 2002, Rietzke, Chen, 2020). Our analysis shows that there may also be verifiable dimensions worth considering. In particular, market size is an essentially observable variable that interacts differently with ==== and ==== programs. Accounting for this may allow the two types of incentives to be balanced in line with policy goals or to incorporate this observable variable into the design of the incentive scheme.====Our article contributes theoretically and empirically to the literature in three ways. It is the first to characterize the heterogeneous impact of orphan regulations for diseases with different levels of prevalence over a long time-span (1983–2016). Second, we study the impact of orphan regulation on both the extensive and the intensive margin, by studying: ====) the probability of obtaining an investment in R&D for a certain disease, ====) the intensity of the R&D effort. Third, we contribute to the literature investigating the different impacts of ==== versus ==== R&D incentives. We show theoretically that in our framework both types of incentive have an unambiguously stronger effect on the extensive margin of investment for less rare diseases, meaning that the impact on the probability of obtaining an investment is greater for less rare orphan diseases. However, the mechanisms involved and hence the size of this difference are not the same for ==== and ==== programs. In terms of investment intensity, it is not possible to conclude unambiguously whether more or less rare diseases benefit more from the incentives.====The empirical analysis exploits a dataset obtained by merging data on Orphan Drug Designations (ODDs), used as a proxy for R&D effort,==== with Orphanet data providing information on disease characteristics (INSERM, 1999). We extend the theory-based distinction between the intensive and the extensive margin of R&D to the empirical analysis by means of a zero-inflated count data model, where the dependent variable is the yearly number of ODDs granted by the FDA at the disease level. For the sake of consistency with the theoretical model, the excess of zeros is modeled using the Gumbel distribution, to replace the standard Logit or Probit model. Our empirical approach exploits the fact that different countries (or geographical regions) introduced reforms at different points in time and, according to our theoretical results, diseases with different prevalence may have benefited differently from the regulations.====We find that, within the class of orphan diseases, the increase in R&D efforts is concentrated mainly on less rare diseases. According to our baseline specification, the difference between the predicted number of orphan designations per year for a disease in the highest and the lowest class of prevalence was 5.6 times larger after 2008 than in the period 1983–1992. The main conclusion remains valid even when controlling for a number of other factors potentially affecting the relative convenience of investing in less rather than more rare diseases. To the best of our knowledge, no evidence of this dynamic has previously been reported. Based on our theoretical analysis and the results of model calibration, we argue that how orphan incentives were designed may have contributed to widening this gap. By relying almost exclusively on ==== incentives, European legislation may have exacerbated this tendency.====In terms of policy implications, our results suggest that, if reducing the number of diseases with no therapeutic option available is a priority, then a revision of the incentive tool-kit should be considered, with the aim of curbing the widening gap between less and more rare orphan diseases. One way of mitigating this tendency could be to shift the balance of incentives towards ==== tools. A more radical reform might be to consider abandoning the idea of setting an arbitrary threshold of prevalence, below which all diseases benefit from the same type of incentives, and to move towards prevalence-dependent incentives.====The structure of the article is as follows. Section 2 describes the various regulations that have been adopted over time. Section 3 describes the model, which is solved in Section 4. Section 5 presents the main results of a model calibration.

The purported goal of CON regulations is to reduce health care costs by generating regional ==== mortality spanning 1968 to 1982. I estimate that CON regulations led to an increase in ==== deaths, by 6%-10%, three years after the policy was enacted.","Certificate of Need (CON) is a set of regulations originally conceived to control health care costs by managing the supply of services offered within a geographic region. CON regulations require health care providers to seek approval from a state health planning agency before opening a new facility or offering a new service covered under CON regulations. Although CON regulations can cover any type of health care facility the largest target of CON regulations are traditionally hospitals. However, the focus on regulating the construction and expansion of health care facilities may also affect the quality of healthcare. Measuring the net effects of CON on health outcomes is important for policymakers looking to adopt CON-like policies. Proponents of CON point out that the increase in volume improves the quality of care, whereas opponents of CON argue that CON affects the adoption of new technology and new entrants.====There are many challenges in identifying the effects of CON. Previous studies have found mixed results on the impact of CON in relation to health outcomes (Conover and Bailey, 2020). Since the introduction of CON is voluntary, states may be reacting to their population’s health needs at that time. The selection can be overcome by using fixed effects at the state or county level. However, if underlying regional differences are influencing health trends across regions then another approach is needed to control for these unobserved heterogeneous characteristics.====An additional challenge with contemporary CON programs are that they differ in terms of scope and intensity across states and is a common concern for CON studies (Bailey, 2018, Ho, 2020). For instance, it is reasonable to expect that CON states that only regulate psychiatric beds will have little effect on heart attack deaths, whereas regulations on cardiac services would have a large effect. Thus, the question of which states should be considered as having an effective CON program will arise. The problem is further exacerbated when considering a CON state with a spending threshold. Since the total expenditures needed to provide cardiac equipment is dependent on the price of the equipment and the hospital’s current ability to house the new equipment.====This paper employs a border discontinuity design that compares two adjacent counties on opposite sides of a state border to avoid the endogenous relationship between health outcomes and regional health trends. This approach ensures that the treatment county will be compared to a similar county. To estimate the impact of CON regulations on mortality, I use death certificate micro-data from the National Center for Health Statistics National Center for Health Statistics (2000) between 1968 to 1982. The federal government passed the National Health Planning and Resources Development Act (NHPRDA) in 1974, which tied health care funding to state-level CON policy that complied with federal standards (Simpson, 1985). During this time period, CON programs were roughly similar across states, allowing for all cross-border county pair policy changes to be comparable without needing to control for the size and scope of each state’s unique CON program. Additionally, this time period is associated with rapid adoption of new technologies and high number of hospital entry following the introduction of Medicare in 1965 (Finkelstein, 2007). The expansion of hospital capital should improve an individual’s access to quality care. If CON regulations are adding additional frictions to the market, then this may cause a delay (or prevention) in the accumulation of new capital, leading to a higher mortality trend when compared to a non-CON state. Given the high levels of capital accumulation during the time period, the differences in health outcomes would be much more noticeable between CON states and non-CON states.====To avoid the endogeneity introduced from the patient’s hospital choice, I restrict the analysis to acute myocardial infarctions (AMI), also known as a heart attack.==== The acute nature of a heart attack reduces the ability to select treatment location, thus removing possible endogeneity from selection bias. Heart attacks are particularly worthy of study because capital expenditures related to treatment of cardiac and coronary disease is often targeted by CON programs. While the mid-1960s was the peak of coronary heart disease, the late 1960s to early 1980s saw advances in medicine, technology, and treatment techniques (Jones and Greene, 2013). The concept of a coronary care unit was first written about in 1961 (Julian, 1961). The coronary care unit is a separate area of the hospital where heart attack patients are specifically treated and is equipped with specialized equipment for treating heart attacks, such as heart monitors and pacemakers. Coronary care units were adopted quickly and within five years, the concept had become widely accepted by general hospitals (Braunwald, 2012). The early open artery theory gained popularity in the mid 1970s which eventually led to the first use of coronary angioplasty in 1977 (Braunwald, 2012). The advances in technology during this time period improved the health outcomes of patients experiencing a heart attack, as long as the health care facility made investments for these technologies.====Since CON can impact the access to care and quality of care, this paper will explore the mortality of the population at the county level, rather than those attributed to hospitals. Exploring mortality at the county level will include deaths from individuals who may have died on route to treatment, transfer to another hospital, or selected not to go in for treatment.====Using a border discontinuity design, I estimate that CON regulations led to an increase in heart attack deaths. This study estimates that three years after CON was enacted, heart attack mortality increased by 6%-10%. Policymakers may find these results useful when considering CON-type policies as the cost of lives lost may be an unintended consequence of attempting to reducing health care costs.",The impact of certificate of need laws on heart attack mortality: Evidence from county borders,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016762962100103X,19 August 2021,2021,Research Article,119.0

Existing examples refer mainly to the provider’s side (==== the decision process of physicians, as proposed by Molitor (2018)), with scant attention to the demand side, despite there being substantial scope for spillovers in healthcare-seeking behaviors. Patients often make medical decisions (==== the selection of a specialist or a hospital) that are potentially based on the experience of people in their networks who have had similar medical conditions.====Information transmission among (potential) patients could help explain, for instance, geographical variations in healthcare expenditures and in the use of medical treatments, which are generally explained by looking only at the supply side.==== However, disentangling the role of information transmission from the role of providers is extremely challenging since information recovered through patients is affected by the health “environment” generated by suppliers. We provide a contribution in this direction. Building on Aizer and Currie (2004), we examine the role of place-specific characteristics and potential channels of information transmission in driving the high and medically unexplained geographical variation in the use of cesarean sections (C-sections) in Italy.====Deliveries are among the first causes of hospitalization for people in many countries, and the large variance in the incidence of C-sections, even within a country, is only partially explained by supply-side factors (Bertoli, Grembi, 2019, Costa-Ramón, Rodríguez-González, Serra-Burriel, Campillo-Artero, 2018, Currie, MacLeod, 2008, Currie, MacLeod, 2017, Shurtz, 2014). C-section rates do not match the actual distribution of risk factors in the reference population, and concerns about the adoption of C-sections without medical indications are driven not only by budget constraints but also by the potential health consequences for both mothers and newborns (Card, Fenizia, Silver, 2019, Costa-Ramón, Kortelainen, Rodríguez-González, Saaksvuori, 2019, Tonei, 2019).====Aizer and Currie (2004) find strong correlation in utilization of prenatal care within ethnic (particularly Hispanic) groups in California. However, they argue that much of this correlation is explained by unmeasured characteristics of the location of the group, so-called neighborhood effects (==== attitude towards the use of healthcare services, and ease of access to health facilities), rather than by information sharing between pregnant women, defined as network effects. A similar analysis is performed by Grossman and Khalil (2020), who analyze the role of social interactions among pregnant women in affecting the use of Medicaid benefits for prenatal care. They estimate that currently, pregnant women are more likely (+8% relative to their reference group) to be enrolled in Medicaid if they are exposed to pregnant women from the same census block who also have participated in the program.====We address the role of neighborhood and network effects in the choice between a C-section and a vaginal delivery, defining networks as groups of pregnant women living in the same municipality.==== Given the nonrandom distribution of women across municipalities, we can observe geographic correlation in the use of C-sections that is driven by underlying characteristics of the specific location (====, distance from healthcare services) or the people living there (====, education, income, and occupational status) rather than by information transmission between pregnant women.====To minimize potential differences in the incentives to perform C-sections across geographical areas, we select one Italian region, Lombardy, which has approximately 10 million inhabitants (16% of the Italian population). Since 2005, Lombardy has eliminated the economic incentives to prefer C-sections over vaginal deliveries through a policy equalizing the reimbursement for these delivery methods (Barili et al., 2021). Using 2006–2014 hospital discharge data provided by the Italian Ministry of Health, for each pregnant woman delivering at time ==== (741,154 deliveries), we define an index of ==== to C-section use at the municipality level. This exposure is defined as the share of C-sections used by pregnant women residing in the same municipality during the 12 months preceding delivery.====We control for place-specific effects (==== neighborhood effects) using several measures. To control for the suppliers’ practice style, we employ fixed effects for the hospital in which the delivery took place since Italian physicians work in just one hospital. To control for the general approach to healthcare (==== more or less invasive), we exploit the geographical organization of the Italian healthcare system in local health authorities (==== LHAs, 15 in Lombardy). We add LHA fixed effects and LHA time trends to take into account managerial changes over the years. Finally, we control for changes in the practice style affecting the residential area (==== a gynecologist who strongly prefers C-sections) using the delivery hospital time trends and, alternatively, a weighted index capturing the incidence of C-sections across hospitals treating patients from the same municipality (Section 4).====If the incidence of C-sections within the woman’s network is one standard deviation higher over the 12 months preceding delivery, then her probability of delivering by C-section is 0.007 percentage points (3%) higher. Simulations suggest that information transmission within a municipality accounts for approximately 13% of the between-municipality variation in the incidence of C-sections.====The estimated effect is robust to restrictions on the sample, such as the exclusion of mothers from Milan, which is the largest city in Lombardy (approximately 1.3 million inhabitants), or the exclusion of mothers coming from other regions. Our results are also robust to the use of extra supply-side controls such as the presence of family care centers or the rate of gynecologists (at the LHA level) and to the introduction of local labor market (LLM) fixed effects and trends.====The magnitude of the estimated effect follows a cubic relationship with a saddle point at the median of the exposure distribution. The larger the exposure is, the stronger its relevance for the individual probability of receiving a C-section, but such a relationship is negative and concave below the median and positive and convex above it. This means that the response to exposure is heterogeneous. Exposure to very low levels of C-section use negatively affects the probability of C-section (i.e., positive spillovers) which is in turn increased by high levels of exposure (i.e., negative spillovers). We show that pregnant women also adjust their choice based on complementary information, such as the incidence of C-section complications and dummyTXdummy– the use of C-sections on low-risk pregnancies (i.e., non-medically motivated C-sections). Finally, we provide additional descriptive evidence on the potential channels of information transmission in maternal care by exploiting data collected through a flash online survey.====We verify the role of information transmission between pregnant women by refining the concept of networks with the use of two more homogeneous groups – Italian pregnant women ====. foreign pregnant women– within the same municipality and estimating the impact of complementary information on the two groups separately. First, we observe that the baseline results are also confirmed in the subsample of foreign women, even when controlling for their nationality and the C-section rate in their country of origin. Following Aizer and Currie (2004), we then compute indexes for exposure, distinguishing Italian ==== foreign pregnant women. If there is only a network effect, and if a network is defined by women of the same nationality living in the same municipality, then the probability of giving birth by C-section should only be affected by the incidence of C-sections within that network.==== While this is true for Italian pregnant women, we cannot exclude the existence of a neighborhood effect for foreign pregnant women, who are indeed affected by the incidence in both groups. This effect might indicate the relevance of place-specific characteristics, as in Aizer and Currie (2004), or could partially capture that integrated foreign pregnant women obtain information from both their group and Italian women (Bertoli et al., 2021). Both groups respond to complementary information, but the response is stronger for foreign women.====The estimated effect is driven by women giving birth on weekdays, which is when most elective C-sections that are planned during pregnancy take place. There is no effect on the probability of giving birth by C-section on a weekend, which is when C-sections are more likely to be performed as an emergency procedure after an attempted vaginal delivery. Giving birth in hospitals that are more likely to use non-medically motivated C-sections weakens the effect of exposure to the municipality incidence of C-sections. As the supply-side propensity to non-medically motivated procedures intensifies, there is a weaker role for demand-side preferences that are influenced by the experience of other women within a network. Characteristics of the medical team operating in the maternity ward (==== degree of specialization) also seems to modify the intensity of role of exposure.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the institutional background. The data used are described in Section 3, while the quantitative indexes and the econometric strategy are described in Section 4. The results and alternative specifications are discussed in Sections 5 and 6, respectively.

These spillovers often are unintended by policymakers, but they can have large impacts on how individuals respond to policy changes and the resulting social welfare effects of those policies. The opportunity for these unintended spillovers is particularly large in the United States, where an array of different government organizations at the federal, state and local levels enact separate policies that interact with one another in complex ways. These interactions mostly have been studied with respect to the social safety net in the US.==== Little research has addressed spillovers from health care policy into the educational sector.==== This lack of research is surprising, since education and health together accounted for 25.2% of GDP in 2017. Health and education are strongly linked through their central role in the development of human capital, and there also are direct policy linkages between the health care and educational systems that both provide services to students with disabilities.====In this paper, we provide one of the first analyses of how healthcare policies spill over to the education sector by examining the effect of Michigan’s Autism insurance mandate on the educational services received by, and achievement outcomes of, students diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). While our analysis contains broad lessons for how health care policies affect educational services and outcomes, the specific focus on students with ASD also is of high importance as ASD is one of the fastest-growing developmental disabilities in the United States. The diagnosis rate among eight-year-olds increased from 6.7 per 1,000 students in 2000 to 16.8 per 1,000 in 2014.==== Among students 3-21 years old, the rate of special education primary disability identifications with ASD rose from 0.2% in 2000 to 1.2% in 2015 (a 500% increase). The overall student disability rate declined slightly over this time period, from 13.3% to 13.2%.==== A recent study using self-reports from 2016 found that among children aged 3 to 17, 2.8% were diagnosed with ASD (Xu et al., 2018). Students with an ASD diagnosis are growing in absolute terms (617,000 children in 2015) and are an increasing proportion of all students with disabilities (9.2% in 2015, up from 1.2% in 2000). Children with ASD typically have substantial learning disabilities that require intensive therapy services throughout childhood as well as coordination between the health care system and the education system. These students cost schools $8,610 more than the average non-ASD student (Lavelle et al., 2014), while the cost to families varies dramatically by health insurance coverage but has been estimated to be as high as $47,000 per year in the US.====Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) is the main therapy used to treat students with ASD. It is not a “cure” but has been shown to substantially improve symptoms through behavioral modification therapy (Peters-Scheffer, Robert, Korzilius, Sturmey, 2011, Dawson, et al., 2010, Virués-Ortega, 2010, Howlin, Magiati, Charman, 2009, Eldevik, et al., 2009, Foxx, 2008). Meta-analyses of ABA trials find that the therapy generates moderate to large positive effects on short-run measures of cognitive performance, including IQ and communication skills (Makrygianni, Gena, Katoudi, Galanis, 2018, Virués-Ortega, 2010). Although there is little direct evidence of ABA on academic achievement, one would expect these improvements in early childhood cognitive skills to lead to better academic outcomes (Duckworth, Quinn, Tsukayama, 2012, Fagan, Holland, Wheeler, 2007, Watkins, Lei, Canivez, 2007).====ABA is most effective when implemented early in life and when done intensively, often for at least 20 hours per week. Because of the high cost of these therapies, schools and families often lack the resources to provide sufficient services to ASD students. Until recently, ABA and other autism therapies were often excluded from health insurance because they were considered “experimental” and/or “educational.” Even when a therapy is not explicitly excluded, coverage may be uneven across health insurance plans both in terms of what is covered and the ages for which therapies are covered.====The lack of coverage for autism services in many private health insurance plans highlights that what treatments students receive relies on the interaction between school-based services and the health insurance plan to which a family has access. The interaction of health insurance and school special education services is not unique to ASD, as these issues are present for many student disabilities.==== Currently, there is very little understanding of how the health insurance and special education systems interact in the production of education services for students with disabilities. The need for expensive extra-curricular treatments that are unevenly covered by health insurance plans makes students diagnosed with ASD an informative group through which to study this interaction.====We provide the first analysis in the literature of how mandating insurance coverage of ASD treatments such as ABA affects the special education services received by and educational outcomes of students diagnosed with ASD. Beginning in October 2012, Michigan required that all private state-regulated insurance plans cover ASD treatment services through age 18. Self-insured plans, while not mandated to cover ASD therapy, were provided generous financial incentives to do so. Medicaid also provided coverage, but only for children under age 6.==== The difference between the Medicaid and private insurance coverage forms the basis of our empirical strategy.====We use administrative data on all public K-12 students in the State of Michigan from the 2009-2010 to the 2014-2015 school years. The data are extremely rich and include not only traditional test scores, demographics, and schools attended but also specific disability diagnoses and the services students receive in school through their Individual Education Plans (IEPs). The data do not include information on the health insurance plan under which each student is covered, so we rely on the close overlap of Medicaid and free/reduced price lunch (FRPL) eligibility. We estimate intent-to-treat models that examine how outcomes among non-economically disadvantaged students (who are mostly covered by private insurance) change when the mandate is enacted in 2012 relative to economically disadvantaged students (who are less likely to be covered by private insurance).==== To further increase the accuracy of our proxies for insurance coverage, we restrict our sample to students who are economically disadvantaged in all years that we observe them in grades 2 through 8 and those never observed during those grades as economically disadvantaged, conditional on being observed for at least two years. We use this sample because students who are persistently eligible for FRPL are the most disadvantaged (Michelmore and Dynarski, 2017), and therefore, most likely to be covered by public insurance.====In a difference-in-differences setting, we first show that the mandate has little effect on the likelihood that a student in grades 2-8 will have an ASD diagnois listed on an IEP. This finding is interesting in its own right, as private insurance can cover diagnostic services. However, most medical diagnoses for ASD occur before the age of six (Fountain et al., 2011), which is likely why we find no effect on ASD identification. We are also only able to observe identification for special education services from the student’s IEP, which is distinct from a medical diagnosis. While these measures are likely highly correlated, special education identification probably underestimates the overall incidence: a surveillance study in the Atlanta metro area found that children with an ASD special education identification almost always met the medical criteria (Newschaffer et al., 2005).==== One net, the lack of any meaningful effect on overall ASD incidence supports a triple difference strategy to examine education services and achievement. We estimate how outcomes among ASD students who are not economically disadvantaged change relative to ASD students who are and how this change relates to the change in outcomes among non-ASD students who differ in disadvantage status.====We find that the insurance mandate reduces the set of special education resources ASD students receive and shifts students towards less restrictive environments. Among ASD students who are never disadvantaged, the mandate causes a 6.4 percentage point (9.5%) reduction in placement in resource room (pull-out) or cognitive impairment programs (self-contained classes for students with cognitive impairments) and a 3.4 percentage point (26.4%) increase in placement in no special education program. These ASD students are 2.3 percentage points (17.7%) less likely to be assigned an ASD-specialized teacher consultant and somewhat less likely to receive social work services. Taken together, these measures indicate that the private insurance mandate led to lower special education resource provision for affected students in schools.====Our data do not allow us to observe the use of ASD therapy services outside of school. To provide some evidence on whether the mandate generates crowd out versus reducing the need for in-school services, we examine student test scores that yield insight into the extent to which the mandate supports or detracts from student learning. There could be a negative effect if service crowd-out is more than 100% or if the privately provided services are of lower quality. Conversely, student learning may increase if overall services increase and/or if the quality of services provided increases. Additionally, providing ABA outside of school may facilitate more inclusion of ASD students in general education classrooms, which can be productive for learning among students with disabilities (Ruijs and Peetsma, 2009). The inability to observe privately provided services precludes a direct analysis of these mechanisms, but we are able to identify the net policy effect that shows how the policy impacts achievement. The achievement results thus provide suggestive evidence of the mechanisms at work.====We find little evidence of a net change in reading or math test scores. In our preferred model that uses non-disabled students as a comparison group, the 95% confidence interval for math in standard deviation units is [-0.046,0.056], and in reading it is [-0.039,0.075]. We thus can rule out anything but modest-to-small changes in math and reading scores due to the mandate. This finding suggests either that crowd-out was complete (and thus total services did not change) or that any reduction in services is balanced by the effects of being in a more inclusive general education environment. Nonetheless, these results suggest there was no adverse effect on students’ academic performance from the mandate.====We also examine heterogeneous effects by gender, race, and grade level. Our results do not vary much across groups, but we do find that girls are more likely to be removed from resource/cognitive programs and more likely to be placed in no special education programs than are boys. Effects are similar for White and Asian versus Black and Hispanic students, but we lack power to estimate precise effects for the latter group. We also find that the effects only begin to appear in grade 2. This grade heterogeneity is sensible, as nearly all students in Kindergarten and some in grade 1 are younger than six and therefore receive increased private ASD services under the mandate regardless of their health insurance status. In terms of test scores, we find little evidence of heterogeneous treatment effects.====This paper contributes to several different strands of research. The first is the small literature that examines the effects of health care policies on student achievement. Most of the prior literature focuses on Medicaid (Cohodes, Grossman, Kleiner, Lovenheim, 2016, Levine, Schanzenbach, 2009) or examines direct health interventions in schools (Lovenheim, Reback and Wedenoja 2014; Reback and Cox 2018; Buckles and Hungerman, 2018). To our knowledge this is the first paper to examine the interaction between the health insurance and special education systems. More specifically, our study is the first to identify causal effects of Autism insurance mandates on the educational services disabled students receive and their subsequent educational achievement.====The second literature to which we contribute is the crowd-out of public goods by private provision (Bergstrom et al., 1986). Such crowd-out (or the lack thereof) has been documented in several contexts like Medicaid (Cutler, Gruber, 1996, Gruber, Simon, 2008, Ham, Ozbeklik, Shore-Sheppard, 2014, Hamersma, Kim, 2013), charitable donations (Payne, 1998; Gruber 2007; Andreoni and Payne, 2011), religion (Hungerman, 2005), and school funding (Gordon, 2004). Ours is the first analysis to show that private health insurance mandates crowd out special education services in public schools. This is an important contribution because special education is by design at the intersection of publicly provided education and often privately provided health care. That changes to private insurance can affect the services that disabled students receive in public schools is a novel finding that has implications for health insurance policies and the funding and provision of special education services.====We also contribute to a growing body of work on policies surrounding ASD students. ASD is a very expensive disability to treat, with current estimates in the US indicating that it costs about $17,000 per year to treat a student with ASD through health care and special education services (Lavelle et al., 2014). There also is suggestive evidence that ASD leads to lower labor force attachment and earnings among parents (Cidav et al., 2012). The lifetime cost of supporting a child with ASD, including potential labor force effects among parents, is between $1.4 and $2.4 million in the US (Buescher et al., 2014). A large literature has arisen that examines the causes of the rise in ASD (see e.g., Hansen, Schendel, Parner, 2015, Matson, Kozlowski, 2011), but to date very little work has been done on what school or health policies can support the academic development of ASD students and how to deliver services to them in a cost-effective manner.====Finally, we present direct estimates of the effect of the Michigan insurance mandate on special education services and academic outcomes. These mandates are growing in prevalence: 46 states (plus D.C.) currently have some form of regulation that requires ASD services to be covered by health insurance plans. However, the scope of what is covered and the ages of children included in the regulations vary considerably across states.==== A small literature has arisen that examines these mandates. Mandell et al. (2016), Barry et al. (2017), and Candon et al. (2019) find that they increase treatment prevalence and spending for those with private insurance: ASD mandates lead to a $77 increase in monthly spending on ASD services. Chatterji et al. (2015) use the passage of state Autism insurance mandates from 2005-2006 to 2009-2010 across the US to examine health care effects on children with ASD relative to non-ASD disabled children. Analyzing children with private insurance, their findings demonstrate no effect of ASD mandates on caregiver self-reports of financial burden, access to care, unmet need for health services, or private insurance coverage. These results are suggestive of full crowd-out of services due to the mandate. We add to this literature by directly examining special education services and student outcomes. Furthermore, the Michigan mandate is among the most expansive in terms of what must be covered and in terms of the ages of children included. Our analysis thus is informative with respect to the potential for these types of policies to impact educational services and outcomes among students with ASD.",Do Health Insurance Mandates Spillover to Education?

However, there are a number of countries where the c-section rate is as high as 50% and little is known about the consequences of such prevalence. According to WHO Statement on c-section, the ideal rate in the population is 10%-15%; “there is a negative correlation between c-section rate and infant mortality up to the c-section rate of 10% and there is no gain from increased c-section rate beyond 10% and up to 30%”. Furthermore, the statement declares that current data does not allow researchers to assess the link between infant mortality and cesarean rates of above 30% (WHO, 2015). Our study fills this gap and provides evidences on Iran where 55% of births by 2014 were delivered by c-section. For that purpose, we take advantage of a quasi-experimental variation following a major health care reform in 2014 which was designed to reduce the rate (see Table A.1 for more details).====C-section rates above the WHO recommended rate is a worldwide phenomenon. In the past 30 years, a rise in the share of cesarean delivery has been observed in almost all countries, for example, in the USA, the rate increased from 20% in 1995 to 32% in 2007 (Martin et al., 2018). Furthermore, there is a large variation in c-section rates between countries, ranging from 0.4%-58% (see Althabe, Sosa, Belizán, Gibbons, Jacquerioz, Bergel, 2006, Cavallaro, Cresswell, França, Victora, Barros, Ronsmans, 2013), and within countries (see Hanley, Janssen, Greyson, 2010, Li, Luo, Trasande, Hellerstein, Kang, Li, Zhang, Liu, Blustein, 2017, Martin, Hamilton, Osterman, Driscoll, Drake).====Although cesarean sections are life-saving if medically indicated, like any other surgery, they can cause complications, especially in settings that lack the facilities to properly conduct safe surgery. At the same time, many developing countries (e.g. Iran, Turkey, Brazil and Egypt) have very high rates of non-medically indicated cesarean cases where the proper facilities might be lacking. In 2014, Iran had one of the highest c-section rates in the world, which motivated the ministry of health to start a country-wide programme to reduce this rate.====The programme started on 5th May 2014 in all public hospitals in the country. The c-section rate in public hospitals was lower than the national average, although still reached as high as 47%. Following the programme, vaginal deliveries became free of charge, the performing doctors received bonus payments for vaginal delivery and they were subject to an annual quota for the maximum number of cesarean deliveries====. Five months later, on 23rd September 2014, the national relative payment scheme was revised so that doctors are paid more for vaginal delivery than cesarean. Since this new scheme satisfied the goal of the policy of providing financial incentives for doctors to perform vaginal delivery and also due to the high cost of the reform, the bonus payment in public hospitals was cancelled at that time. The new payment scheme affected the financial incentives of doctors whether working in public or private hospitals. We consider this as the second phase of the intervention although it was not officially part of the reform.====As shown in Fig. 1, the c-section rate declines sharply after the first phase of the programme. This reduction is higher in public hospitals which were the main target of the reform. Furthermore, first-birth mothers at their peak fertile age (17–35 years old) are the main complier group as the c-section rate among this group decreases at a higher rate than the average. The absolute magnitude of reduction is 5, 6 and 13 percentage points for the total, sample of public hospitals and first-birth sample in public hospitals, respectively. Since the c-section is a very persistent procedure and many medical guidelines recommend or allow women to choose repeated c-sections after a prior procedure, reducing the rate among first-birth mothers is expected to reduce the total rate further in the long run.====In this study, we show that high c-section rates are due to the frequent use of elective (planned) cesarean births==== and in order to plan the procedure with certainty, many infants are born early term i.e. in the 38th week of gestation. After the programme, by decreasing the number of early term deliveries, gestation length increases by, on average, three days for compliers, which results in 130 g increase in birth weight. Apart from the effect on gestation age and birth weight, we do not observe any adverse health effect on infants in terms of Apgar score, hospitalisation and mortality rates. We also do not see any change in access to c-section for high-risk pregnancies.====The novelty of our research is not restricted to the health outcomes of the infants. The structure of the programme enables us to disentangle different demand and supply side incentives for c-section deliveries. We show that financial incentives of doctors, whether in the form of absolute payment or the quota, play a major role in the effectiveness of the programme; however, other incentives of doctors such as leisure time (cesarean is a quick and certain procedure in comparison to vaginal delivery) as well as demand for cesarean are very strong in a country with very high rates; because of that, the national rate is still higher than many developed countries.====Furthermore, although we do not have any specific information about doctors, we demonstrate that doctors are quite heterogeneous in their response to the programme. Those whose propensity to perform a cesarean was above the quota responded twice as strong as low-propensity doctors. In the short run, low-rate doctors increased their work in public hospitals; but in the medium run, the programme shifted high-rate doctors out of public hospitals. These doctors lost their market share in terms of the number of annual deliveries. Doctors who lose their patients are those who have the flexibility to work in both public and non-public sectors and their procedures are taken up by doctors who are limited to working in one sector. Working in non-public hospitals is not an option for all doctors. Based on the Iranian health care code of conduct, registrars must work for four years as part of their training in public hospitals. Apart from registrars, studies show that other doctors who mainly work in public hospitals are either recent university graduates with low levels of experience or relatively low ability doctors who could not attract enough patients to their private offices (Alijanzadeh et al., 2016). Therefore, we expect that the programme shifted high-skilled doctors out of public hospitals.====Our paper contributes to the literature of physician induced demand, when physicians shift the demand of patients according to their own self-interest (McGuire, 2000). In the case of child birth, Gruber and Owings (1996), in a seminal paper, show that American gynaecologists compensated their income shock which resulted from the decline in fertility by substituting vaginal delivery with the highly reimbursed c-section. Further studies discuss other channels such as leisure incentives (Brown III, 1996, Costa-Ramón, Rodrıguez-González, Serra-Burriel, Campillo-Artero, 2016, Halla, Mayr, Pruckner, Garcia-Gomez), fear of malpractice (Dubay et al., 1999) and tort reforms (Currie and MacLeod, 2008). The programme in Iran, by targeting the financial incentives of doctors, helps us to discuss the relative importance of different channels for demand inducement. We show that financial incentives are strong determinants, but other supply side channels as well as inelastic demand for c-section also play major roles in the very high c-section rate in the country.====This study is also related to the literature of causal effect of c-section on infants’ health outcomes. Most papers in this area used an instrumental variable approach to identify the marginal infant who could be born vaginally but ended up receiving a cesarean (Card, Fenizia, Silver, 2018, Costa-Ramón, Rodrıguez-González, Serra-Burriel, Campillo-Artero, 2016, Jachetta, 2014); while we benefit from an exogenous shock to the access to c-section produced by the reform. Apart from methodological differences, our paper is distinguished from previous studies because first, we focus on a developing country with very high rate of c-section; and second, we estimate the total effect on both planned and unplanned cesareans (and actually our variation mostly comes from the change in the frequency of planned c-sections) while all other studies only focused on emergency c-sections in order to maintain the relevance of the instrumental variable. The results of the previous papers with regards to the health measures are diverse. For example, Card et al. (2018) find a significant impact on mortality rate while failing to document any effect on Apgar score====. On the other hand, Costa-Ramón et al. (2016) and Schulkind and Shapiro (2014) find a significant effect on Apgar score but fail to observe any change in mortality rate. Taheri et al. (2021) report no effect on Apgar score but a reduction in infant hospitalisation. We do not find any effect in terms of Apgar score, mortality rate and admission to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) which is consistent with reported outcomes in this strand of literature.====Finally, our results are in line with the literature on the birth timing manipulation and its consequences for the health of newborns. Most studies have exploited temporary birth scheduling near the cut-off of a policy change on baby bonus or child tax benefits (Borra, González, Sevilla, 2019, Brunner, Kuhn, 2014, Neugart, Ohlsson, 2013, Schulkind, Shapiro, 2014). Our point estimates in terms of the effect of shorter gestation length on birth weight is similar to Schulkind and Shapiro (2014). Like Neugart and Ohlsson (2013), we fail to find any effect on very low birth weight. Jacobson et al. (2021) explore a birth timing manipulation near US holidays in California and, other than a slight reduction in birth weight, fail to show any significant effect on Apgar score, labour complications, admission to NICU or the use of assisted ventilation. They show that providers’ incentives play a crucial role in manipulating births around holidays. Their results both on health outcomes and on demand and supply side incentives are in line with our findings. Note that, in our study, we focus on a larger scale birth timing manipulation at all times in the population, resulting from high rates of c-section deliveries.====The paper is organised as follows: Section 2 talks about the background of this specific health care reform in Iran.

Particulate matter air pollution is associated with high economic damages, having deleterious effects on infant mortality, life expectancy, physical health, mental health, and health costs (Bishop, Ketcham, Kuminoff, 2019, Chay, Greenstone, 2003, Deryugina, Heutel, Miller, Molitor, Reif, 2019, Dockery, Pope, Xu, Spengler, Ware, Fay, Jr, Speizer, 1993, Pope, Burnett, Thun, Calle, Krewski, Ito, Thurston, 2002, Pope, Dockery, 2006). Particulate matter has been shown to affect earnings, property values, criminal behavior, labor productivity, and educational attainment (Chang, Graff Zivin, Gross, Neidell, 2016, Chay, Greenstone, 2005, Colmer, Voorheis, 2020, Ebenstein, Lavy, Roth, 2016, Graff Zivin, Neidell, 2012, Herrnstadt, Heyes, Muehlegger, Saberian, 2019, Isen, Rossin-Slater, Walker, 2017).====Conventional wisdom, and a growing literature, suggest that marginal health damages from pollutants like particulate matter are high in developing countries.==== However, the mechanisms are not well understood. High marginal damages in developing countries could be explained by higher levels of pollution if damage functions are convex. It is well-documented that current particulate concentrations are many times higher in urban areas of India, China, Pakistan, Ghana, etc. than in urban areas of North America and Europe (Bombardini, Li, 2020, Currie, Vogl, 2013, Greenstone, Hanna, 2014, Pullabhotla, 2019). Under this logic, cost-effectively reducing marginal damages involves reducing pollution levels. Another possibility is that high marginal damages in developing countries may be due to the limited ability of exposed populations to manage the consequences of pollution. Differences in institutional and economic conditions could lead to different marginal pollution damages, regardless of the shape of the damage function. Following this logic, efforts to reduce marginal damages by directly reducing pollution may be less cost effective. Incremental investments in population health and human capital, health care, and other infrastructure may be more cost-effective.====Here, we inform the debate over the channels explaining lower marginal particulate matter damages in developed countries by re-examining the relationship between gestational PM exposure and infant health using administrative data on the universe of births and deaths in high particulate pollution, high income Hong Kong between 2001 and 2014. Existing analyses of marginal PM-health relationships come from high income, low particulate matter settings (i.e. developed nations) or low income, high particulate matter settings (i.e. developing nations). By contrast, Hong Kong offers the unusual combination of both high pollution and high income. Hong Kong’s particulate matter levels are close to those in mainland China, India, and Pakistan yet its per capita income levels compare to the United States. Hong Kong’s population has excellent baseline health and universal access to free high-quality health care. Life expectancy ranks in the top-10 worldwide.====We identify the effects of endogenous particulate matter exposure on birthweight, low birthweight, and neonatal mortality by exploiting plausibly exogenous variation in thermal inversions (Arceo, Hanna, Oliva, 2016, Chen, Oliva, Zhang, 2017, Chen, Oliva, Zhang, 2018). We find that higher gestational particulate matter exposure is associated with significant reductions in birthweight and significant increases in low birthweight. These marginal PM-birthweight effects are substantial; a 10 ==== increase in particulate matter is associated with the equivalent of the estimated effects of smoking 15 cigarettes per day during pregnancy (Currie et al., 2009). Birthweight outcomes are important indicators of health that have been shown to have persistent effects on later life (Almond, Chay, Lee, 2005, Almond, Doyle, Kowalski, Williams, 2010, Bharadwaj, Vellesen Loken, Neilson, 2013, Colmer, Voorheis, 2020, Currie, Moretti, 2007, Isen, Rossin-Slater, Walker, 2017). By contrast, we fail to detect significant marginal effects of gestational PM on neonatal mortality. The marginal effects of PM on neonatal mortality are noisily estimated but small both in absolute terms and relative to the existing literature. We fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no marginal effect on neonatal mortality in Hong Kong in all specifications.====One interpretation of our Hong Kong results is that the location’s wealth and health may not strongly influence marginal PM-birthweight relationships but may play an important role in mitigating marginal PM-mortality relationships. Hong Kong has excellent healthcare yet marginal changes in particulate matter have large effects on birthweight. Since interventions targeting child health are challenging prior to birth, birthweight effects may be less responsive to health and other institutions. Hong Kong has high particulate matter concentrations yet marginal changes in PM have small effects on neonatal mortality.==== When PM concentrations change, Hong Kong’s wealth, health, and institutions may facilitate post-natal health interventions that buffer against effects on neonatal mortality.====To explore this latter conjecture, we combine data from multiple internally valid studies - including our own - to examine and contextualize marginal PM-mortality damage estimates across the literature. This comparative exercise sacrifices precise identification in order to inform unanswered broad economic questions (Akerlof, 2020). We standardize and transparently quantify marginal PM-mortality effects across contexts. We focus on policy-relevant absolute marginal PM-mortality effects. We directly examine macro-level correlates of marginal PM-mortality damages. We find that marginal PM-mortality effects across locations are sharply decreasing in baseline health and decreasing in GDP per capita. By contrast, we find that marginal mortality effects are largely unrelated to a location’s baseline mean particulate matter concentrations. Although conventional wisdom suggests that marginal particulate matter damages are high in less-developed countries because they are highly polluted, we provide early evidence that marginal PM-mortality damages are high in less-developed countries because they are less developed.====We make three contributions. First, we provide new evidence on the marginal damages of particulate matter pollution in a unique context. The existing literature provides limited evidence on the marginal effects of pollution on ==== and ==== in a ==== setting, as related studies typically focus on the low-pollution settings of the developed world for data availability reasons. Although an emerging literature does explore the effects of pollution on neonatal ==== in ==== settings, most other studies do so using data from low-income developing countries. Second, our comparative exercise allows us to explore correlates of the marginal particulate-mortality relationship across diverse settings. Existing studies take disparate approaches to quantifying estimates, make relatively few cross-institutional comparisons and provide limited detail on how comparisons are constructed, and frequently interpret results in relative percentage terms. Our standardized approach focusing on absolute marginal PM-mortality effects addresses the concern that a given percentage reduction in neonatal mortality means something different in countries with vastly different baseline conditions. Third, the free, high quality healthcare system in Hong Kong facilitates access to excellent data for an entire population. Free universal healthcare offers particularly compelling data on vulnerable populations often undersampled in other contexts.====Our paper is most closely related to recent work by Cheung et al. (2020). Cheung et al. (2020) exploit transboundary pollution to examine the effects of pollution on mortality across the age distribution in Hong Kong, with a focus on cardio-respiratory mortality. Cheung et al. (2020) explain trends in the effects of air pollution over time in Hong Kong, noting significant declines in marginal mortality damages after the SARS epidemic and in neighborhoods that do not have a hospital with accident and emergency services. Our paper differs in several ways. First, outcomes differ. We focus on birthweight, low birthweight, and neonatal mortality. Infant health and mortality are of interest because policy makers focus on protecting vulnerable populations and because infant outcomes have implications for long-term health and human capital development (Currie, 2011). Second, identification strategies differ. Our paper exploits thermal inversions for identification. Studying infants also has advantages for identification since causal relationships between pollution exposure and outcomes occur over short time horizons (Currie et al., 2009). Third, economic questions differ. Our broad aim is to develop insights for the economic question of explaining differences in marginal pollution damages across economic circumstances.","Why are pollution damages lower in developed countries?

On the contrary, our results suggest a strong role of women in affecting their children’s health outcomes across generations in developing countries.","Equality of opportunities is often declared as a societal objective. However the extent to which individuals have the opportunity to fulfil their aspirations largely depends on the ability to overcome intergenerational constraints. Economists have long been interested in measuring the intergenerational transmission (IGT) of socio-economic outcomes (Black, Devereux, 2010, Solon, 1999). A key policy interest is to distinguish the role of the environment a child is growing in (“nurture”) from the genetic transmission of parents’ characteristics (“nature”). Nurture calls for targeted actions aiming at strengthening the initial endowments of individuals in terms of physical and human capital.====In this paper, we estimate the intergenerational elasticity of lifespan between parents and children, using linked registered data from rural China between 1789 and 1906. We find strong intergenerational transmission in health between parents and their sons, in particular for mothers. Controlling for assortative mating, the intergenerational correlations for fathers and mothers stand at about 0.27 and 0.58, respectively. We then compare the outcomes of children born from fathers who are brothers or twins. Interestingly, when comparing children from twin brothers, the intergenerational transmission of health between fathers’ and children’s lifespans is null, suggesting that it is mostly driven by genetic factors.====Our contribution lies at the crossroad of two strands of literature: first, studies using health outcomes to shed light on intergenerational mobility and, second, studies that highlight the relevance of such mobility in developing countries. While the economic literature in the IGT has focused on earnings, education or welfare dependence (Chetty, Hendren, Kline, Saez, 2014, Holmlund, Lindahl, Plug, 2011, Solon, 1992), there is still limited evidence on the intergenerational transmission of health outcomes. Existing studies establishing a positive intergenerational association in a variety of health outcomes are Currie and Moretti (2007), Classen (2009), Royer (2009), Bhalotra and Rawlings (2011), and Parman (2012). Most of them focus on weight, a relatively short-term and more volatile health outcome. An exception is Bhalotra and Rawlings (2011) who investigate the association between mothers’ health and children’s anthropometric measurements, together with neonatal, infant and under-five mortality, for 38 developing countries. Beyond the scope of their analysis, a major difference with our study is that they do not attempt to disentangle nurture from nature and focus on the associations between two generations. That is also the case for most of the other studies using weight as a health outcome.====We consider a long-term health outcome, the lifespan, i.e. the approximated number of years between birth and death. As pointed by Parman (2012), lifespan has the major advantage to receive a common interpretation across contexts, time and gender. Parman (2012) is certainly the closest to our work. Using data on North Carolina, he finds very strong intergenerational correlations of lifespans between daughters and mothers and between sons and fathers. In particular with sons, the intergenerational elasticities for fathers and mothers stand at about 0.36 and 0.16, respectively. In our study, we find strong elasticities for mothers, whereas the association with fathers’ lifespan is always weaker, especially when the specification is augmented with grand-father or father twin fixed effects, which are more likely to control for unobserved heritable traits (“nature”). Our results also contrast with Lindahl et al. (2016). By exploiting a sample of adoptees and non-adoptees, they find largely similar intergenerational transmissions of health between biological mothers and fathers in Sweden. However, they also provide strong evidence of a nurturing role for mothers since the level of education of the adopting mothers has a significant effect on the health of the adoptive children.====Furthermore, the study of intergenerational associations between parents and children is very relevant in developing countries, where imperfect credit and labor markets limit the ability to escape poverty traps across generations. While the literature has reached a relative consensus of an income intergenerational elasticity between 0.3 and 0.45 (Chetty, Hendren, Kline, Saez, 2014, Solon, 1999), little is known about the magnitude of such correlation in developing countries. The gender dimension is particularly interesting to study, given the potential role of mothers in nurturing children (Duflo 2012). As far as we know, only few recent papers focus on the intergenerational transmission of health in developing countries (Bhalotra, Rawlings, 2011, Bhalotra, Rawlings, 2013, Eriksson, Pan, Qin, 2014). As explained above with Bhalotra and Rawlings (2011), one major difference with the existing literature is that we seek to distinguish between nurture and nature, using grand-father and father-twin approaches. Eriksson et al. (2014) use age and gender adjusted average health measures in the parent’s province as an instrumental variable, to assess the transmission of health across two generations in China. Compared to their approach, the use of grand-father and father-twin fixed effects does not require exclusion restrictions and the results are not driven by local average treatment effects (Black and Devereux, 2010). One of the strengths of our analysis is to consider successive generations, to assess the relevance of the AR(1) model and the stability of the IGT across generations. Furthermore, our paper does not only contribute to the more established literature on intergenerational transmission but also to the more recent advancements on multigenerational transmission (Anderson, Sheppard, Monden, 2018, Barone and Mocetti, 2020, Lindahl, Palme, Massih, Sjogren, 2015, Solon, 2018).","The transmission of health across 7 generations in China, 1789–1906",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629621000783,24 July 2021,2021,Research Article,125.0

The worldwide efforts to raise awareness for contraception and the absence of cheaper alternatives of reversible birth control suggest the prevalence of this method will expand (United Nations, 2015). However, to a large extent, access to the Pill is determined by dynamic market forces. Individuals may opt-in or out of this product depending on price fluctuations, which could affect the odds of conception and the conditions under which a potential pregnancy develops.====This paper quantifies the Pill’s role in fertility and child outcomes using a sequence of events in which unexpected shocks affected the access to oral contraceptives. In particular, we exploit a well-established case of anticompetitive behavior in the pharmaceutical market, which—after a year-long price war between the three largest pharmaceutical retailers in Chile—triggered a sharp and unexpected increase in the prices of birth control pills.====The price war took place during 2007, and it effectively reduced the prices of medicines across the board. In particular, prices of oral contraceptives fell by 24% during that year. By the end of 2007, the three largest pharmacies agreed to end the price war and engaged in a collusion scheme in which they strategically increased the prices of 222 medicines. Oral contraceptives were included in this group, experiencing price increases ranging from 30 to 100% in just a few weeks (45% on average in the first three weeks). We use daily information on prices and quantities sold in the country by the three companies from almost 40 million transactions to determine the date when the price changes for birth control pills took place. Using these data, we implement an interrupted time-series analysis (Bloom, 2003, Cauley, Iksoon, 1988), which takes into account the seasonality of births, the general trends of fertility, as well as dynamics that arise because it takes time for the menstrual cycle to be fully regulated after discontinuing the Pill’s intake. We complement the pharmacies’ transaction data with administrative information from birth and death certificates collected between 2005 and 2008 and administrative records on school enrollment from 2013 to 2016. Our empirical strategy considers two different treatments: one stemming from a sustained and steady decline in prices (2007) and another one from a massive and sudden increase (first weeks of 2008).====Our estimates suggest that consumers are reactive to increases and decreases in the price of contraceptives. However, these responses are asymmetric. By the end of the year-long price war, the demand for the Pill increased by 28%. However, the subsequent skyrocketing increment in prices caused a sharp decrease in contraceptive use. Within four months after the price increase, consumption of oral contraceptives was back to pre–price war levels. As a result, at the peak of the effect, about 146 additional individuals were born in Chile per week, a 3.2% increase in the weekly birth rate. That contrasts with the small changes in fertility in response to the steady and incremental price reduction observed during 2007. We find significant effects of the price increase on the numbers of children born out of wedlock and from women in their early twenties. Furthermore, although the price war significantly reduced the incidence of underweight births, and fetal and infant deaths, the price spike that followed led to increases in these dimensions that exceeded the gains achieved while contraceptive prices were falling.==== We do not find significant impacts among teenage mothers or households located in economically deprived areas, as was expected due to their typically low usage of oral contraceptives (Ministerio de Salud, 2007).====Lastly, we analyze the long-term consequences of the unexpected price increase of 2008. In particular, we estimate its impact on kindergarten, first-grade and second-grade enrollment for the years 2013–2016, when the children born in 2008 reached school age. We find that children conceived shortly after the price shock were less likely to enroll relative to those conceived during the 2007 price war. Furthermore, conditional on enrolling, these children were more likely to attend education programs for children with intellectual disabilities.====These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that those conceived during the first weeks of 2008 were relatively more likely to face less favorable conditions during critical periods of development. As an extensive literature has shown, the development of healthy children and adults is greatly affected by economic and environmental deprivation while in-utero (Almond, Currie, 2011, Black, Devereux, Salvanes, 2007, Eriksson, Kajantie, Osmond, Thornburg, Barker, 2009, Kiernan, Huerta, 2008, among others); stress, depression, and emotional hardship during pregnancy (Black, Devereux, Salvanes, 2016, Class, Lichtenstein, Långström, D’Onofrio, 2011, Huttunen, Niskanen, 1978, Kiernan, Huerta, 2008); and maternal behavior (Currie, Moretti, 2003, Jayachandran, Pande, 2017). In addition, previous studies have shown that unintended pregnancies are more likely to suffer from such deprivations. According to public health and medical studies, women with unintended pregnancies are less likely to abandon unhealthy habits (Dott, Rasmussen, Hogue, Reefhuis, 2009, Hellerstedt, Pirie, Lando, 1998), may delay prenatal care (Mayer, 1997), and the pregnancy itself may become a source of stress and anxiety (Biaggi et al., 2016). In consequence, children born from unintended pregnancies may be on average less healthy than those born from intentional ones (Bustan, Coker, 1994, Sharma, Synkewecz, Raggio, Mattison, 1994).====Two aspects of our setting strengthen the interpretation of our findings. First, we may expect a lack of timely complementary investments in the health of the pregnancy as the numbers of unwanted and/or cryptic—when a woman does not find out she is pregnant until 20 weeks along or later—pregnancies increase.==== Second, throughout the period of analysis, not only abortion was illegal in Chile but also other medications that could interrupt pregnancy (e.g., Misoprostol) were not sold in the country. As a consequence, we can isolate the impact of the Pill’s price fluctuations on fertility from statutory changes affecting abortion availability and/or access (Lu, Slusky, 2019, Myers, 2017).====This paper extends several branches of the literature. First, it contributes to the limited evidence on the relationship between prices and demand for contraception and its effects on fertility.==== Second, it provides new evidence linking changes in the Pill’s availability to shifts in the average health of the children conceived, which highlights the role of selection into and out of the consumption of the Pill due to changes in its affordability.==== Third, our analysis pins down a channel by which anticompetitive agreements between firms can cause substantial long-lasting harm even if antitrust enforcement stops them (Baker, 2003, Levenstein, Suslow, 2006). In fact, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to quantify the short- and long-term impacts of anticompetitive behavior in the pharmaceutical industry on both consumers and their descendants.==== As a consequence, our findings should serve as a cautionary tale for current cases of market failures in the pharmaceutical sector all around the world, most notably in the US, where cases like the EpiPen, insulin, and Daraprim—to name a few—have caught the public’s attention.====The paper is organized as follows.

During this time, caloric intake — particularly of foods high in sugar or fat — has increased considerably, likely due to declining prices of unhealthy relative to healthier foods (Brownell, Farley, Willett, Popkin, Chaloupka, Thompson, Ludwig, 2009, Cutler, Glaeser, Shapiro, 2003, Drewnowski, Darmon, 2005, Popkin, 1994, Powell, Chriqui, Khan, Wada, Chaloupka, 2013, Rehm, Peñalvo, Afshin, Mozaffarian, 2016, Slining, Popkin, 2013). In response, policymakers have been considering various price-based interventions, such as taxes on specific products like sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) (see Cawley et al., 2019b for review), on high-calorie foods (Aguilar, Gutierrez, Seira, et al., 2019, Batis, Pedraza, Sánchez-Pimienta, Aburto, Rivera-Dommarco, 2017, Batis, Rivera, Popkin, Taillie, 2016, Taillie, Rivera, Popkin, Batis, 2017), or on foods similar in nutritional content across products, e.g. rich in sugars or fats (Harding, Lovenheim, 2017, Thow, Quested, Juventin, Kun, Khan, Swinburn, 2011, WHO).====Increasingly, raising prices of foods similar in nutritional content is being discussed in light of concerns that in response to, for instance, a SSBs tax, consumers may substitute taxed sugary drinks with other high-calorie sugary foods or foods rich in fats (Avena, Bocarsly, Hoebel, 2012, Finkelstein, Zhen, Nonnemaker, Todd, 2010, Gearhardt, Corbin, Brownell, 2009, Harding, Lovenheim, 2017, Schroeter, Lusk, Tyner, 2008). Prior work has suggested that compared to taxes like SSBs, targeting foods rich in sugar, for instance, has larger effects on nutrition. A 20 percent tax on sugary foods reduces caloric intake (across sugar and fats) by more than 18 percent, but a 20 percent tax on soda decreases caloric intake by about 5 percent while increasing the intake of fats (Caro, Ng, Taillie, Popkin, 2017, Dubois, Griffith, Nevo, 2013, Harding, Lovenheim, 2017). Higher prices of sugary foods may therefore cause weight-loss either through decreased consumption of sugary foods – known to be a main source of excessive calorie intake (Bowman, Gortmaker, Ebbeling, Pereira, Ludwig, 2004, Popkin, Nielsen, 2003) – or of some other high-calorie diet. How such diet responses to price changes map to health, however, is hard to predict, as it also depends on the productive relationship between nutrients and health and on how pre-existing health mediates that relationship (Basu, Yoffe, Hills, Lustig, 2013, Cândido, Valente, Grześkowiak, Moreira, Rocha, Alfenas, 2018, Lustig, 2013, Lustig, Schmidt, Brindis, 2012, Samaha, Iqbal, Seshadri, Chicano, Daily, McGrory, Williams, Williams, Gracely, Stern, 2003, Slining, Popkin, 2013).====This paper provides new evidence on how changes in the prices of nutritionally similar foods, particularly those rich in fats or sugars, affect prevalence of (overall and abdominal) obesity, diabetes and hypertension, and further examines the extent to which these health responses to price changes vary by ones pre-existing health – links not yet examined in this literature. Prior work had limited access to a detailed nutritional breakdown of foods: it largely relied on cruder classifications to distinguish prices of “healthy” (e.g., vegetables and fruits) versus “unhealthy” high-calorie foods (e.g., hamburgers, candies, fries, or sugary drinks), which varied in items as well as in their nutritional composition across studies (Auld, Powell, 2009, Beydoun, Powell, Wang, 2008, Giuntella, Rieger, Rotunno, 2020, Kim, Kawachi, 2006, Sturm, Datar, 2005). Thus, most of the studies so far linked weight gain to changes in prices of specific product groups, such as prices of SSBs==== or fast-foods,==== and results have been inconclusive. Additionally, only a handful of studies have linked these prices to chronic disease (Anekwe, Rahkovsky, 2018, Goryakin, Monsivais, Suhrcke, 2017, Wang, Coxson, Shen, Goldman, Bibbins-Domingo, 2012), or to obesity measures other than body mass index (BMI) (Burkhauser, Cawley, 2008, Chou, Rashad, Grossman, 2005).====This study investigates how prices of ==== of unhealthy foods matter for health in the context of Mexico, which constitutes an ideal setting for overcoming some of the obstacles in the literature. In contrast to limited exogenous variation in processed food prices observed in the US (Cawley, 2015), Mexico experienced significant variation in relative prices of foods since the mid-1990s both spatially and over time. Though there were several possible sources of price variation during this period, one source that is especially relevant to variation in prices of processed and unhealthy foods was the gradual expansion of trade policies such as import quotas, reduced tariffs, and the removal of barriers to foreign direct investments after the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was signed between Mexico and the US in 1994. These policies resulted in an outward shift in the supply of processed foods rich in added sugars and fats, followed by a significant decrease in their prices (Barlow, McKee, Basu, Stuckler, 2017, Clark, Hawkes, Murphy, Hansen-Kuhn, Wallinga, 2012, Giuntella, Rieger, Rotunno, 2020). As Mexican domestic markets at that time were poorly interconnected and heterogeneous, supply of these foods and price changes varied differentially across regions and over time (Giuntella, Rieger, Rotunno, 2020, Nicita, 2009, Unar-Munguía, Flores, Colchero, 2019). Though identifying the specific source of price variation is beyond the scope of this paper, I provide supportive evidence on this trade-driven variation in prices.====I use representative price data for urban areas that track retail prices for over 25,000 food products annually across 46 Mexican cities over a 15-year period between 1995 and 2010, and link them with detailed hand-collected product-specific nutritional information. I then use nutritional information of these products to classify them into nutritionally-similar food clusters using ====-mean clustering analyses.==== Using these data-driven classifications, I construct price indices for nutritionally-similar foods at either the state or city level. Specifically, I construct prices of foods rich in sugar (FRIS), fat, fat and protein, protein and fiber, sugar and fats, and sugar and fiber. Food prices,tracked continuously at the product-store level, are comparable over time.==== I combine these longitudinal price indices with (i) 15 years (1995–2010) of state-level administrative data on diabetes and hypertension incidence drawn from the Mexican health care system, and (ii) a nationally representative, individual-level panel data on health outcomes for children and adults, covering the period 2002–2009 (Mexican Family Life Survey or MxFLS: Rubalcava, Luis y Teruel, Graciela, 2006; Rubalcava, Luis y Teruel, Graciela, 2008; Rubalcava, Luis y Teruel, Graciela, 2013). The state-level dataset offers to study long-term effects of prices on objectively measured health outcomes, whereas MxFLS allows us to study heterogeneity in results by measuring health outcomes on both chronic disease (e.g., self-reported diabetes, hypertension) and several obesity measures (e.g., measured weight, height, waist and hip circumference) with rich information on individuals’ health profiles and behaviors at baseline and over time.====Exploiting the within-city or state yearly price changes between 1996 and 2010, I estimate a linear specification using ordinary least squares, modelling health outcomes of Mexican children (aged 6–19) and adults (aged 20+) as a linear function of prices of FRIS and of other foods; individual or state fixed effects (to account for unobserved time-invariant tastes, preferences or other factors as well as baseline differences); calendar year indicators (to account for nationwide secular trends); local characteristics (eg., rainfall, GDP, number of fast-food restaurants and their advertising expenditures to account for the widespread availability of cheap calories and local demand shocks); and individual characteristics, including distance to the nearest city, working status, medical insurance, age, socio-economic status, years of schooling, mental health and health behaviors, such as exercise, cooking, TV or internet use, and sleep. I assume that conditional on these controls, local changes in prices are exogenous and that changes in unobservable determinants of one’s health are uncorrelated with changes in prices of FRIS over time.====I find that prices of FRIS are associated in a statistically and economically significant way with changes in health outcomes, whereas prices of foods rich in other nutrients mostly are not. On average, a decrease in prices of FRIS significantly increased BMI, waistline circumference (WC) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), as well as the probability of being obese and abdominally obese, key risk factors for developing metabolic disease.==== These elasticity estimates (====0.02 and ====0.04 for BMI and WC, respectively) are comparable in size to estimates of BMI elasticities to fast food prices in the US (Chou, Rashad, Grossman, 2005, Powell, 2009). They explain about 15 percent of the rise in obesity prevalence in Mexico between the mid 1990s and 2010; a finding similar to Giuntella et al. (2020), who show that imports of unhealthy foods decreased their prices, and explain up to 20 percent of the rise in obesity prevalence among Mexican women during a similar period using different data. Lower prices of FRIS also increased the likelihood of being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and hypertension; for instance, a ten percent decrease in prices of FRIS increases the probability of receiving a diabetes diagnosis by about five percent. I find that the association between FRIS prices and most health outcomes is the strongest in the first year following a price change and diminishes over a period of four to five years.====I document a relatively fast impact of FRIS prices for several health outcomes. For weight, waistline, and obesity measures, this is expected and consistent with Lin et al. (2011) and Finkelstein et al. (2013) who show that more than 90% of the weight-loss after a price intervention is expected to be achieved within two years. Though one may expect chronic diseases (like diabetes or hypertension) to take a longer time to develop and manifest, research has consistently shown that even a short duration of sub-optimal diet may lead to a diagnosed chronic disease for those with an elevated risk of these conditions.==== In line with this evidence, I show that individuals with a higher baseline risk of developing diabetes or hypertension indeed drive the relationship between changes in FRIS prices and chronic disease incidence. First, I divide individuals (at baseline) into 3 risk groups (low, medium, and high risk) of developing diabetes or hypertension using established health risk assessment forms, and show that the price elasticity is the highest for those in the high-risk group. Second, in line with previous studies in the US (Powell, Auld, Chaloupka, OMalley, Johnston, 2007, Sturm, Datar, 2005), I find higher price elasticities for FRIS among overweight and obese individuals. Specifically, abdominally obese individuals, who are at a significantly increased risk for developing metabolic disease (see review by WHO, 2011) exhibit an elasticity about three times as large as individuals who are not. Apart from supporting and lending credibility to the empirical estimates in this paper, these results also suggest that people benefitting from price-based policies the most may be those at the highest risk for metabolic disease; that is, the least healthy individuals.====The relationship between lower FRIS prices and worse health is robust with regards to checks that address concerns such as spurious correlation between prices and health, reverse causality, or omitted variable bias. I show that the results are robust to the inclusion of region-year fixed effects, linear state trends, to controlling for trends by individual baseline risk for chronic disease and are not sensitive to exclusion of selected controls. Applying several falsification tests, I find no evidence that, conditional on controls, changes in prices of FRIS are correlated with local conditions that might influence health regardless of their price change.====Though excessive consumption of added, non-natural sugars has been linked to a host of negative health outcomes (Basu, Yoffe, Hills, Lustig, 2013, Johnson, Segal, Sautin, Nakagawa, Feig, Kang, Gersch, Benner, Sánchez-Lozada, 2007, Lustig, 2013, Lustig, Schmidt, Brindis, 2012, Teff, Grudziak, Townsend, Dunn, Grant, Adams, Keim, Cummings, Stanhope, Havel, 2009), this paper does not show how a particular diet is harmful to health. It does show, however, that lower relative prices of foods rich in specific ingredients such as sugar lead to a diet that might be. This empirical finding that price changes of FRIS, in particular, alter health outcomes contributes to current debates on how to best design price-based policies to influence dietary patterns and health (Adda, Cornaglia, 2006, Batis, Rivera, Popkin, Taillie, 2016, Cawley, Thow, Wen, Frisvold, 2019, Evans, Ringel, 1999, Fletcher, Frisvold, Tefft, 2010, Mullainathan, 2005, Powell, Chaloupka, 2009, Wasserman, Manning, Newhouse, Winkler, 1991). The findings in this study are particularly important in light of several countries considering taxes on unhealthy foods that are particularly rich in added sugars. Though several countries are well on their way to taxing SSBs (see review by Cawley et al., 2019b), examples of countries that instituted broader taxes with less risk of unhealthy substitutions include Hungary, where the public health tax applies to the salt, added sugar, and caffeine content of various ready-to-eat foods (WHO, 2015b); Mexico, which taxes high-calorie non-essential foods (Batis et al., 2016); and French Polynesia, which taxes a wide range of foods that are high in added sugars (Thow et al., 2011). Finally, this paper is one of the first to link prices of nutritionally similar foods to obesity and chronic disease in a low- and middle-income country setting. Once associated with high-income countries, obesity is now prevalent and growing the fastest in these regions, where at the same time we have observed an influx of cheap, high-calorie unhealthy foods high in sugar and a drop in their relative prices (Atkin, Faber, Gonzalez-Navarro, Barlow, McKee, Basu, Stuckler, 2017, Clark, Hawkes, Murphy, Hansen-Kuhn, Wallinga, 2012, Giuntella, Rieger, Rotunno, 2020, Hawkes, 2006).====This paper proceeds as follows.

Moreover, I find a strong and persistent learning spillover that amounts to an average increase of more than 150% in medical expenditure relative to prior to the health shock, and I demonstrate that this effect promotes health investment. While the first result is in line with previous findings in the literature, the second is novel.","Although the influence of social networks on healthcare consumption is increasingly recognized (Debnath, Jain, 2020, Deri, 2005), relatively little attention has been given to the role of the family. This lack of attention remains despite the potential for a health event experienced by one family member to spillover to the health care consumption of relatives through at least two channels. The first, emphasized by Fadlon and Nielsen (2019), is a behavioral channel: witnessing the ill-health and medical treatment of a relative increases the salience of health behaviors, causing changes in risk perceptions, health habits and utilization of healthcare. The second is a learning channel: a relative’s experience of medical treatment provides information about the effectiveness of healthcare as well as the coverage and benefits of a health insurance plan. To date, empirical research on learning in health insurance has focused on choice between plans (Abaluck, Gruber, 2011, Abaluck, Gruber, 2016, Brot-Goldberg, Chandra, Handel, Kolstad, 2017, Kaufmann, Müller, Hefti, Boes, 2018, Ketcham, Lucarelli, Miravete, Roebuck, 2012, Kling, Mullainathan, Shafir, Vermeulen, Wrobel, 2012, Schmitz, Ziebarth, 2017). This paper extends the literature by examining learning within a specific plan achieved through observing a family member’s claim experience.====The goal of this paper is to study how health shocks trigger spillovers through behavioral and learning changes among family members. I provide evidence that aims at separately identifying and quantifying these channels, as they are distinct determinants of healthcare consumption and have different policy implications. My identification strategy exploits two types of unpredictable shocks that allow detection of a causal effect operating through each channel: a spouse’s non-fatal heart attack or stroke, and a severe injury to a child. I use an event-study framework to estimate how a non-injured adult family member (spouse or parent) responds to these shocks through the consumption of healthcare. Identification relies on exogeneity of the shocks, which is arguably plausible because the timing is likely unforeseen. Also, the research design relies on the shock severity requiring immediate and considerable medical care that sufficiently drives spillover effects. Hence, the nature of these shocks, together with the examined kinship relationship, addresses potential endogeneity problems.====I study each channel by classifying the healthcare utilization of the non-injured family member following the shock. In the context of the behavioral channel, the main outcome is consumption of preventive care that is directly linked to the shock’s risk and consequences. The reasoning for that outcome is salience. Following a relative’s health event, one’s attention and awareness of the event domain increases and in turn leads to re-evaluation of behavior that could relate to the health event, including an increase in the demand for preventive care to avert a similar shock. This approach is motivated by Fadlon and Nielsen (2019), who examined family health-behavior spillovers under similar settings and found strong evidence of a local behavioral effect following a health shock. To study the learning spillover channel, I construct a measure of residual changes in healthcare utilization that include treatment unrelated to the health shock. I use this outcome as a proxy for learning based on the reasoning that the demand for treatment unrelated to the event risk or consequences is not likely to be driven by a behavioral change, resulting in learning as the main alternative explanation. Other mechanisms could naturally confound the analysis. For example, the consumption of event-related healthcare could increase due to learning that the marginal benefits of medical care are higher than expected, or that the consumption of non-event-related healthcare could increase because it also become more salient. Yet, given the strong evidence provided by Fadlon and Nielsen (2019), it is reasonable that the demand for event-related healthcare is driven by behavioral spillover and that salience plays a major role in generating this effect. Also, identification strategy of the learning channel relies on the argument that the effects on healthcare unrelated to the event are most likely operating through this channel, but are not necessarily exclusively driven by it.====Within each channel I examine two health-care utilization variables: total medical expenses that represent the health insurance consumption value, including out-of-pocket expenses and expenses reimbursed or covered by insurance, and the number of interactions with healthcare services.==== These two measures capture both the intensive and extensive margins of health care utilization and generate a comprehensive picture of the role of spillovers in shaping healthcare demand.====To empirically investigate these spillover channels, one must use an extensive data set with linkages across family members, including details on diagnoses and healthcare spending. Moreover, information on the family’s insurance plan is necessary, such as benefits, coverage, and cost structure. I use data provided by the RAND Health Insurance Experiment (HIE), a large-scale, randomized-controlled trial that was conducted from 1974 through 1982. The random assignment of families to insurance plans applied in the RAND HIE provides exogenous variation that assist in overcoming potential identification problems including adverse selection, selection based on age, and selection caused by past experience with health insurance plans.====I begin by studying spouses’ responses to their partners’ non-fatal heart attacks or strokes to compare the magnitude and persistence of the learning and behavioral spillover channels. I associate the behavioral channel with consumption of cardiovascular-risk-related preventive care and the learning channel with treatments unrelated to a cardiovascular risk. The cardiovascular preventive-care outcome includes medical testing for hypertension, testing for cholesterol levels, and use of medicines for lowering cholesterol levels and treating blood pressure. Given this approach, I estimate a long-lasting and significant spillover effect through each channel. In particular, I find that over a four-year horizon, on average, behavioral spillovers increase the medical expenses (reimbursed and unreimbursed) of the spouse by more than 200% relative to expenses incurred before the health shock to their partner. In addition, I find a strong and persistent effect associated with learning spillover among spouses represented by an increase of more than 150% in healthcare utilization unrelated to the health shock, relative to prior to the health event. While the first result is in line with previous findings (Fadlon and Nielsen, 2019), the second is novel.====I further explore the learning spillover channel by studying changes in parents’ healthcare consumption after a sudden and severe injury to their child. To deal with endogeneity concerns, I choose injury categories unrelated to the underlying health of the parent and exploit the potential randomness of the timing and occurrence of the injury. The goals of this analysis are as follows. First, to assess the generalizability of the evidence on learning spillovers obtained from spouse responses to their partners’ health event; second, to investigate the means by which the learning channel operates; and third, to preclude alternative mechanisms.====The main alternative mechanism is through the structure of the health insurance plan. When a family’s medical out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditure reaches a threshold in a calendar year, there are no additional coinsurance payments above this maximum. Thus, if a health event experienced by one family member has left them with a permanent health condition that required OOP spending up to the maximum in subsequent years, the consequent lower marginal price faced by other family members could cause them to increase their consumption of medical care irrespective of any spillover effect (Lin and Sacks, 2019). To address this, I examine a sub-sample of families that did not reach the OOP maximum following a child’s unexpected injury (hereafter, “restricted sample”). I find that a child’s injury significantly increases the parent’s health care consumption not only in the full sample but also in the restricted sample. This finding suggests that learning is a plausible explanation for the increase in the parents’ healthcare consumption, as well as for the increase in a spouse’s use of healthcare that is unrelated to the risk or consequences of the heart attack or stroke experienced by his or her partner.====I use the parental response to a sudden injury of a child to investigate how spillovers occurring through the learning channel shape individuals’ healthcare utilization and particularly the effect on the type of treatments that individuals demand. I test the hypothesis by which a health shock generates learning spillovers about health insurance coverage and the effectiveness of healthcare by showing that a shock triggers investments in elective healthcare, but does not impact the demand for emergency care. I use wellness physician visits and wellness dental treatments as proxies for health investment under the assumption that these treatments are dependent on the discretion of the insuree, as well as treatment for chronic conditions and hospital visits as examples for urgent and non-postponable treatments. A comparison of the consumption of these treatments types following the injury yields striking results. The findings indicate a significant increase in the demand for elective treatment, with a similar persistence to those observed in the inclusive utilization measures, while the demand for chronic treatments and hospital visits remains virtually unchanged. This analysis reveals a health-care consumption pattern following a health shock that is strongly indicative of learning even in the absence of direct measures of knowledge acquisition.====My paper builds on several studies. The notion of behavioral spillovers relates to studies that have documented correlations among family members in health-related behaviors.==== Cutler and Glaeser (2010) found that spousal peer effects have a substantial impact on smoking behavior; Cawley et al. (2017) found evidence of positive sibling effects on weight and obesity using genetic risk scores; and Fadlon and Nielsen (2019) found intra- and inter-generational family behavioral spillovers in healthcare consumption that are consistent with evidence presented in this paper.==== Although these studies underscore the key role that the family unit plays in shaping one’s health, much uncertainty remains regarding the magnitude of such effects on general healthcare consumption and the mechanisms by which they operate. This paper fills this gap.====Health economists have previously studied the concept of learning about health insurance plans. Ketcham et al. (2012) used learning about Part D providers to explain the reduction in over-spending implemented by switching plans. Abaluck, Gruber, 2011, Abaluck, Gruber, 2016 discussed the absence of learning and described inconsistencies in optimizing behavior when choosing insurance plans. Kling et al. (2012) emphasized the complexity of health insurance products and found that increasing competition, which results in a larger number of health insurance plans from which to choose, harms rather than improves welfare. Supported by a growing body of literature on health insurance literacy documenting the limited ability of individuals to access, process, and understand health insurance information,==== these papers and others have agreed that individuals have a limited understanding of health insurance features. However, as previously mentioned, empirical research has mainly examined consumer choices between health insurance plans. Here, this approach is expanded to study the learning process that occurs within a specific plan.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the conceptual framework for both the behavioral and learning spillover channels. Section 3 discusses features of the RAND HIE data that make it suitable for studying family spillovers. Section 4 outlines the empirical settings and the analysis sample. Section 5 describes the empirical framework. Section 6 presents the findings on family spillovers through behavioral and learning channels, discusses the operational mechanisms through which spillovers might drive changes in healthcare demand, and addresses concerns regarding alternative mechanisms.

Policies include state of emergency declarations, blunt general restrictions such as stay-at-home (SAH) orders, and targeted rules such as restrictions on bars, restaurants, entertainment venues, and schools. Exploiting variation in the timing of policies in difference-in-difference models, we show that much of the decline in foot traffic early in the pandemic was due to private precautionary behavior. SAH orders explain almost none of the foot traffic decline in industries with high risk of virus transmission, but they do explain a substantial share of the decline in moderate- to low-risk industries such as outdoor sports and visits to parks. Targeted restrictions tend to impact intended industries, as well as complementary ones. We show that the impact of targeted restrictions is largest in counties with no SAH restrictions, suggesting that better targeting of public restrictions can have important efficiency gains."," Public support for SAH restrictions has been high throughout the pandemic. A nationwide survey of 2,200 adults by Morning Consult found that 69 percent of respondents supported SAH orders in June, falling only to 68 percent by November.==== Despite their popularity in these surveys, many also consider SAH restrictions to be the cause of recent wide-spread economic dislocation. ==== show that SAH restrictions reduced spending at small businesses and large retail stores. Moreover, protests against SAH restrictions have occurred in a number of states,==== with court cases filed in numerous jurisdictions challenging the constitutionality of SAH orders.====, ====, ==== and ====), ==== and ====), and ====. ====) provide a detailed review of this literature. A large cross-section of this literature argues that the bulk of the decline in measures of social distancing that occurred in the early months of the pandemic was not due to SAH restrictions, but rather to voluntary precautionary behavior on the part of individuals. ==== conclude that information such as the first case in an area drove increased social distancing much more than SAH orders.====As the literature on what drives social distancing has advanced, so has our knowledge of how the virus is transmitted. ==== use cell-phone records to model mobility and subsequent case counts and argue that 80 percent of COVID-19 infections can be traced to a small number of super-spreader locations such as restaurants, bars, gyms, hotels, and houses of worship. Using case-control methods ==== confirm the impact of eating and drinking establishments as a source of high transmissions. In contrast, surveillance data suggests that daycare centers (====) and elementary schools (====) are not particularly important sources of transmission. Likewise, outdoor activities appear to pose much lower risk to participants than virtually all indoor activities (====; ====; ==== and the result has been interpreted by many to suggest supermarkets are super-spreader locations.==== Grocery store workers appear to be at a high risk of infection. A study of 104 grocery store employees in Massachusetts found an infection rate of 20 percent (====). Despite this, a study that examined an outbreak of COVID-19 among supermarket employees found high rates of transmission from employees to family members but low rates of infection among store customers (====).====, we consider foot traffic patterns in 10 industries that we categorize into three different groups: higher transmission risk venues (restaurants, bars, hotels, churches, and indoor entertainment), medium-risk venues (essential retail, non-essential retail, and business services), and lower-risk venues (outdoor sports and parks). We also use one omnibus measure of social distancing: the fraction of cell phones that are home all day. All ten industry-specific foot-traffic measures declined substantially as the pandemic aged while the latter increased considerably.====We begin by documenting what others have found – much of the increase in social distancing is not attributable to SAH restrictions but, rather, precautionary behavior on the part of individuals. We show this in two ways. First, we use structural break models to show that the most dramatic declines in foot traffic occurred prior to the adoption of legal interventions. In particular, we find that in a seven-day period from March 8-14, industry-specific foot traffic measured at the national level dropped dramatically, well before any state or local restrictions of note were in place. For most mobility measures we analyze, the structural shift occurs in most states in a very short period. For example, during the five-day window from March 8-12, all states saw a structural break in the fraction of cell phones that are home all day.====Second, we exploit state and county variation in the adoption date of specific social distancing orders in difference-in-differences models to estimate their impact on the mobility measures outlined above. The orders we consider are state of emergency declarations (SOE), public school closings, bans on dine-in restaurants, restrictions on entertainment, bans on gatherings above 50 people, and SAH restrictions. The business services industry is unique in that employers’ decisions about employee remote work likely plays a larger role in driving the response than customer mobility. In all other industries, foot traffic likely contains a more even mix of individual customer responses and supply responses such as business closings. In these models, we control for county and day ====, as well as quadratics in average daily temperature and precipitation at the county level. We illustrate that these controls are key in eliminating pre-treatment trends in event-study results present in some earlier studies. We then use these difference-in-differences results to decompose how much of the decline in foot traffic in the early stages of the pandemic can be attributed to precautionary behavior, SAH restrictions, and other industry-specific orders.====We report several key findings. First, from peak to trough, the decline in foot traffic is both massive and correlated with the risk-level of the establishment. We document declines between 67 and 84 percent for establishments that are higher risk and 41 and 69 percent for medium or lower risk. Second, unlike some work that finds no impact of government restrictions, we find that SAH restrictions explain between two and 25 percent of the mobility decline, depending on the mobility measure. Moreover, we are the first to show that the share of the decline explained by SAH orders is closely related to the riskiness of the activity. Almost none of the decline in foot traffic in high-risk establishments is due to SAH orders; however, a quarter of the decline in essential retail and 10-16 percent of the decline in outdoor activity is due to SAH orders. Third, restrictions on particular industries have predictable and measurable impacts, similar in magnitude to the SAH restrictions. For example, restrictions on dining in restaurants reduce traffic in restaurants, but also in complementary industries such as hotels and indoor entertainment venues (e.g., movie theaters and bowling alleys). Fourth, after aggregating policy effects, we confirm that the majority of the decline in foot traffic is due to precautionary behavior rather than induced by policy.====These results indicate that precautionary behavior was tied closely with underlying risk, with individuals avoiding the riskiest venues the most. At the same time, the bluntness of the SAH order meant that the impact of the restriction was greatest in establishments with the lowest transmission risk. SAH orders never applied to essential retail but they reduce traffic in those venues by 25 percent. Likewise, SAH orders had a large impact on outdoor activity, which has little risk of transmission and may be beneficial if they allow exercise or an escape from the quarantine.====These results led us to consider whether more targeted policies could potentially have an impact. While our previous analysis showed that the most well targeted policy to date, restaurant dine-in bans, reduced restaurant foot traffic, most jurisdictions faced a SAH restriction shortly after their dine-in ban, potentially mitigating any long-run effects. To address this, we reduce the sample to the 455 counties facing neither state- nor county-level SAH restrictions, but a variety of other state-level restrictions, including restaurant dine-in bans. In these models, we find that restaurant dine-in bans yielded large, statistically significant reductions in restaurant foot traffic, without lowering foot traffic in unrelated industries. In fact, the estimated effect of this targeted policy in counties without a SAH restriction is more than twice as large as in counties with a SAH restriction. These results suggest that mobility restrictions targeted towards industries associate with higher virus transmission risk possibly offer a more efficient means of reducing virus spread than blunt SAH restrictions.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: ==== details the mobility and policy data used in our analysis. In ====, we present basic time-series for industry foot traffic and social distancing, establishing that mobility declines began well in advance of most legislative actions. In ==== and ====, we use difference-in-differences models to estimate the impact of both targeted and non-targeted policies on mobility. In ====, we estimate the effect of highly targeted restaurant dine-in bans in the absence of SAH restrictions. In ====, we conclude and discuss future policy implications.","Total shutdowns, targeted restrictions, or individual responsibility: How to promote social distancing in the COVID-19 Era?",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629621000825,17 July 2021,2021,Research Article,130.0

His knee was repaired to the extent possible at the time. Years later Mr. Jones visited a Veterans Affairs physician to complain about the condition of his knee, as it was causing him considerable discomfort during routine activities. The physician informed him that his knee was in a continuous state of decline, and that short of total knee replacement, there was nothing either of them could do about the condition of his knee. In addition, the physician stated that the decision to undergo total knee replacement was entirely up to Mr. Jones, as he was in the best position—not the physician—to judge how his quality of life was being affected by the declining condition of his knee. Mr. Jones was also informed that the outcome of the surgery is expected to be better, and the risk associated with it lower, the longer he waited to undergo surgery, due to advancements in medical technology and accumulation of surgeon experience.

(2017, p. 1430), “Patients who are considering undergoing joint replacement should balance the potential benefits of an improvement in their quality of life against the potential risks of the intervention: death, medical complications, infection, poor functional outcome, and the need for revision surgery.”====In order to more generally frame the present contribution, consider a patient who is diagnosed by an ethical and honest physician with a non-life-threatening condition or ailment. The condition is known to grow worse over time and there is nothing that can be done about it either by the medical community or the patient, other than for the patient to undergo a medical procedure. The medical expertise and technology exists to correct the ailment and is known to yield better expected outcomes with less risk the longer the patient waits to undergo the procedure—these are two key factors providing incentives for the patient to delay the medical treatment under consideration. The decisions of if and when to undergo the procedure is entirely up to the patient, not the physician, as the patient is in the best position to determine the degree to which the ailment is affecting their quality of life. The procedure is fully covered by insurance, so out-of-pocket expenses are sufficiently small and fixed. What would be a rational patient's choice of time to undergo the medical procedure to correct a non-life-threatening ailment? This decision problem is formally modeled and the model's qualitative properties—the central results of the paper—are studied.====The resulting model is purposely uncomplicated but uses general specifications for the primitive functions. As a result, the refutable implications derived from it are robust and do not rely on the specification of functional forms that are chosen because, say, they provide a closed-form solution. The main finding is that the time at which an elective medical procedure is chosen by a risk averse and prudent patient, and the expected lifetime utility of said patient, respond to changes in the exogenous variables in a more or less intuitive and predictable fashion. In short, the paper provides a basis on which to examine how an expected improvement in treatment outcomes due to progress in medical technology and surgeon experience affects a patient's decision as to when to undergo the medical procedure.====Not surprisingly, versions of the Mr. Jones story are commonplace. According to Williams et al. (2015, p. 5), total knee replacement was among the five most frequent inpatient surgeries from 2000–2010 in the U.S., and it was the most frequent in 2008, 2009, and 2010, with nearly 700,000 total knee replacements performed among inpatients aged 45 and over in 2010. Similarly, Wolford et al. (2015, p. 1) reported that approximately 326,000 total hip replacements were performed in the U.S. in 2010, while Sloan et al. (2018, p. 1458) forecasted that there will be 635,000 to 909,900 total hip replacements and 1.26 to 1.68 million total knee replacements by 2030 in the U.S. What is more, these estimates understate the number of total joint replacements, seeing as they do not include ankle, elbow, and shoulder replacements, nor do they account for partial joint replacements.====Labek et al. (2011) have documented that the revision rates are positive but small for all joint replacements—the revision rate for total hip replacement is 6.45% after five years and 12.9% after 10, with slightly lower percentages for total knee replacement. They also documented considerable variation in revision rates across countries for the same type of joint replacement. In other words, joint replacement surgery entails at least some risk, seeing as an exogenous, uniform, non-stochastic rate of depreciation cannot fully rationalize the above. Accordingly, surgical risk plays a fundamental role in the proposed model of patient decision making. Moreover, Stavrakis and SooHoo (2016, p. 1453) argued “ … that total ankle replacement would demonstrate increasing utilization and lower complication rates given advances in implant design and growth in surgeon experience.” Indeed, over time, surgical outcomes have generally improved and the risks associated with them have declined because medical technologies and surgical skill have improved. These facts are taken into account in the model. In particular, medical technological progress and the accumulation of surgical experience are the central features of the model that motivate delaying a medical procedure by a patient who elects to correct a non-life-threatening ailment.====Another condition that exhibits the above flavor is cataract, whose numbers are considerable. According to Lindstrom (2015, p. 62), cataract surgery is the most common procedure performed by an ophthalmic surgeon, with an estimated 3.6 million cataract procedures performed in the U.S. in 2015 and more than 20 million performed worldwide. The intraocular lens used in cataract surgery is permanent and will never cloud, and unlike an artificial joint, there are no moving parts in the lens that could wear out over time. Hence revisions are rare, but if they do occur they are the result of less-than-perfect, i.e., risky, surgeries.====There is also evidence of a delay between diagnosis and surgery for the kinds of ailments under consideration. For example, using information from more than 1 million beneficiaries aged 40 and older with cataracts who were enrolled in a US nationwide managed-care network from 2001 to 2011, Kauh et al. (2016) found that 23% underwent cataract surgery, all of whom experienced a delay from the date of diagnosis until surgery. The shortest median delay by hospital referral region was approximately two and one-third weeks in Victoria Texas, while the longest was just over one year in Yakima Washington. Attributing observed waiting times in the range of a few weeks to expected advancements in treatment seems plausible only in the unlikely event of an imminent implementation of an improved treatment and, hence, it is questionable whether the delays were due to medical technological progress and the accumulation of surgeon experience. On the other hand, 77% of the patients did not have surgery during the study period, implying that patients either waited longer to undergo surgery or never elected it. Similarly, based on data from 3.07 million Medicare and Veterans Health Administration patients from 2002 to 2012, Wu et al. (2018) found that 21% had cataract surgery within 5 years of being diagnosed, or in other words, 79% of the patients waited as least 5 years after their diagnosis of cataract to have surgery or decided not to have it.==== None of this is surprising, however, seeing as “With cataract surgery, there can be a 10- to 20-year delay between diagnosis and treatment because the surgery is elective,” according to Rapaport (2018). Moreover, standard medical advice regarding cataract is that one should (i) not rush to surgery because cataract is not life threatening, and (ii) only consider surgery when cataract sufficiently interferes with one's vision or daily activities.====It is important to point out that there is at least one complicating factor to consider when interpreting empirical evidence akin to that in the preceding paragraph regarding waiting times, viz., observed waiting times are the equilibrium outcomes of demand and supply forces. For example, a comparative statics result derived in Section 4 shows that as a medical procedure becomes less risky due to medical technological progress and surgical experience, risk-averse and prudent individuals will choose to undergo the procedure sooner. This will increase the current demand for the particular medical procedure. If the increase in demand is not offset by a corresponding increase in supply, the observed waiting time will increase, despite the fact that a patient prefers to undergo the surgery sooner. It is therefore worthwhile to remember that only demand-side factors are accounted for in the present work, as the model pertains to the medical-procedure optimal timing decision of a patient.====Marshall et al. (2018) provided complementary evidence regarding the factors which affect the time at which patients prefer to undergo total joint replacement. Using a questionnaire designed for a discrete choice experiment, Marshall et al. (2018, p 525) found that “Surgeon reputation … was the attribute with the greatest relative impact on patient choices” and that “Patients are willing to wait longer for surgeons having better reputations (‘excellent’) than for those who have lower reputations (‘good’ or ‘satisfactory’).” In other words, patients are willing to delay surgery when the outcome of it is expected to be better.====Taking a different approach, Kern and Pliskin (2011) developed mixed-integer mathematical programming models to determine the optimal time at which to undergo total joint replacement when the objective is to maximize quality-adjusted life-years. They noted four reasons for delaying joint replacement surgery: (i) weight bearing implants have a finite life, eventually resulting in pain and the need for replacement, (ii) implant survival is a decreasing function of its use, implying that joint replacement should be postponed for more active patients, (iii) implant survival is a decreasing function of a patient====s weight, thus joint replacement for heavier people should be done as late as possible, and (iv) new materials and techniques are developed over time, so joint replacement should be delayed as long as possible in order to use the most updated technology. Kern and Pliskin (2011) attempted to account for the first three in their quantitative model, whereas the model developed here accounts for medical technological progress, i.e., reason (iv), and the accumulation of surgeon experience over time. Using actual data for one of the authors, Kern and Pliskin (2011) calculated that the optimal time to wait was 5 years in the deterministic version of their model and approximately 2.5 years in the stochastic version. In other words, delaying surgery beyond the time of diagnosis was always optimal in their models, which, it should be noted, model the demand side of the market.====There is also a small literature related to, but decidedly different from, the present work, most notably that by Whynes (1995), Driffield and Smith (2007), and Meyer and Rees (2012). All three model a condition that involves “watchful waiting.” According to Whynes (1995, p. 478), “Watchful waiting refers to the provision of routine, supervisory care within a monitoring regime which will alert the practitioner to any change in the patient's condition.” It may be prescribed for slow growing cancers such as lymphoma or prostate cancer, or for diseases that progress slowly. Watchful waiting is also a recommended treatment option for benign prostatic hyperplasia, inguinal hernia, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and mild chronic hepatitis C, and is also a recommended treatment for conditions that have the potential to resolve themselves due to the body's curative capacity, such as the common cold, ear infections, and mild forms of depression. This stands in contrast to the class of ailments contemplated here, which are not life-threatening, do not resolve themselves on their own, and for which only a medical procedure can halt their progression. Moreover, the monitoring and testing that goes along with watchful waiting is used to inform the physician—the decision maker in such instances—as to when surgery or more aggressive medical intervention is required. For the class of ailments contemplated herein, the patient is the decision maker and knows fully well how the progression of the ailment is affecting their quality of life but does not know with certainty the outcome of the procedure. Compared to models of watchful waiting, which assume that a patient's state of health before intervention is stochastic and may get better or stabilize, and that the treatment outcome is deterministic, the present theory more or less models an opposite situation.====The salient and distinguishing features of the proposed model are that (i) it includes gradual improvements in the expected outcome of a medical procedure due to medical technological progress and accumulation of surgical experience, (ii) the ailment is not life threatening, (iii) the medical procedure is elective, (iv) the decision to elect the procedure is that of the patient, not the physician, and (v) the medical procedure is risky. In contrast, Whynes (1995) employed a watchful waiting framework and contemplated a physician-made decision to minimize total expected treatment costs for a given population by choosing the optimal time to switch from a treatment that involves a strictly positive risk of relapse, to a treatment that entails a definite cure. Meyer and Rees (2012) considered the optimal timing of a patient undergoing a medical treatment as an optimal stopping problem when the state of health of a patient evolves stochastically. The decision maker in their framework is not the patient, as it is here, but rather an omniscient regulator who knows a patient's preferences, observes the patient's state of health at every point in time, and knows the stochastic process governing the evolution of the patient's state of health. Driffield and Smith (2007) were the first to employ a real-options approach to the optimal timing of a medical treatment. Their model is essentially a special case of that considered by Meyer and Rees (2012).",Non-life-threatening ailments and rational patience when expected treatment outcomes are continuously improving,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629621000801,16 July 2021,2021,Research Article,131.0

Forced migrants, for instance, commonly experience risky journeys with limited access to health services, inadequate rest, and insufficient supplies to meet their basic needs. Additionally, this population consistently reports having had limited access to any health services, pharmaceutical and health preventive supplies, and adequate food and water within their country of origin for extended periods of time before migrating.==== As such, forced migrants arrive at their hosting locations in extremely poor health, which can facilitate the spread of infectious diseases.====Our purpose in this paper is to study the role of forced migration in the spread of infectious diseases and explore some of the main transmitting channels. We make several contributions to the understanding of the role of social interactions in the spread of infectious diseases. First, we focus on the effects of forced migration. Previous studies have analyzed the role of trade (Oster, 2012), school, and public transportation closures (Adda, 2016). As of today, however, the incidence of involuntary migration on the spread of diseases remains largely unstudied==== despite the increased growth of involuntary migration flows—which by 2019 reached almost 80 million individuals (UNHCR, 2019). Montalvo and Reynal-Querol (2011) and Baez (2011) are two noteworthy exceptions, documenting that forced migration caused by civil wars increased the spread of malaria, diarrhea, and fever in hosting locations. Understanding the role of forced migration in the spread of a more comprehensive list of infectious diseases is key for the adequate formulation of control and preventive public policies in the hosting communities.====Second, we use unique and rich monthly municipal data on the incidence of 15 infectious diseases within a developing country. The data span the period between January 2012 and December 2018. In contrast to Montalvo and Reynal-Querol (2011) and Baez (2011), we are able to examine all the infectious diseases of interest for the migrant population and distinguish between age groups by type of disease. The age-based analysis is important given that children and elderly are typically more vulnerable to infectious diseases and can show different transmission patterns. Examining the spread of a broad range of infectious diseases is novel in the economics literature, which has mostly studied the incidence of HIV (Oster, 2005, Dupas, 2011, Lakdawalla, Sood, Goldman, 2006, Oster, 2012), influenza, chickenpox, and gastroenteritis (Adda, 2016).====Third, we provide suggestive evidence on which stage of the migration process may drive the incidence and subsequent spread of a large number of infectious diseases. The vulnerability of migrants to infectious diseases depends on the epidemiological profile of the country of origin, the migration process, and the conditions at the destination (Montalvo, Reynal-Querol, 2011, Barnett, Walker, 2008, Baez, 2011, Castelli, Sulis, 2017, Kluge, Jakab, Bartovic, D’Anna, Severoni, 2020). The type of infectious disease acquired varies for each of these stages. For example, poor travel conditions may increase the incidence of tuberculosis, while a collapse of the health system in origin may explain the incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases. In addition, the spread of diseases on the local population may result from contact with migrants that arrived infected to the destination country, a congestion of health services due the increasing pressures from the arriving migrants or, indirectly, a decrease on the income of natives due to a stronger competition in labor markets. Identifying the spread of particular infectious diseases and the main transmitting channels is important to provide more fine-grained policy recommendations on the stage of the migration process at which policy-makers should intervene (e.g., vaccination of newly arrived migrants or increasing access to health services at destinations).====Fourth, we examine the effects of forced migration on the health of natives and exclude migrants. This is important as we are able to cleanly measure the added effect of migration on the native’s health as opposed to the displacement of health problems from one country to another. For instance, the health of migrants may improve upon arrival to Colombia as they have better access to health services. This is a relevant dimension in which our paper is different from Montalvo and Reynal-Querol (2011) and similar to Baez (2011). However, relative to Baez (2011), we study the effects of migration on a larger population, more health outcomes, and different age categories.====We examine the role of Venezuelan forced migration in the spread of 15 infectious diseases in Colombia. As a consequence of the intense political, social, and economic crises in Venezuela, out-migration from that country has been ongoing since early 2015. The United Nations Refugee Agency estimates that by 2018, 4.2 million Venezuelans, over 14.5% of the country’s population in 2018, left and were being hosted by regional neighbors in Latin America (see UNHCR, 2019). Data from ====, the Colombian migration agency, suggests that by December 31, 2018, 1.26 million Venezuelans had migrated to Colombia with the intent to stay there. However, the actual number is likely higher because many forced migrants refrain from reporting their status due to their fears of being deported.====The fifteen diseases that we study are the most predominant within Venezuelan migrants according to several health local authorities, and some of these diseases have also been identified as diagnoses of national interest by the Colombian Ministry of Health due to recent increments in their incidence (see CHM, 2019, CHM, 2019, Grillet, Hernández-Villena, Llewellyn, Paniz-Mondolfi, Tami, Vincenti-Gonzalez, Marquez, Mogollon-Mendoza, Hernandez-Pereira, Plaza-Morr, et al., 2019, Human Rights Watch, 2019; and WHO, 2019). We classified the diseases into three groups as follows: (i) vector-borne, which includes malaria, dengue, leishmaniasis, chagas disease, and yellow fever; (ii) vaccine-preventable, which includes chickenpox, measles, rubella, tuberculosis, diphtheria, and whooping cough (pertussis); and (iii) sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), which include HIV, syphilis, hepatitis B, and chlamydia. The data that we use on the prevalence of these diseases are predominantly based on Colombian patients with access to the subsidized or contributory health regimes, which cover 95.5% of the population (Ministry of Health, 2020).====Our empirical strategy exploits the fact that municipalities closer to the five migration points in Colombia face a greater level of exposure to infected migrants when the total monthly inflows of Venezuelans increase. More formally, as data on migration flows are not available at the municipal level, we construct a monthly municipal measure of ==== based on the interaction of the inverse distance to the main migration points and the total monthly migration flows from Venezuela to Colombia. We use the population census of 1993, 2005 and 2018, the last three census with micro data available, to verify that our ==== measure performs well in predicting the location of Venezuelan migrants in Colombia. We test for the validity of the parallel trends assumption by estimating separate coefficients for predicted migration inflows between 2012 and 2014, when migration was low, and 2015 and 2018, when migration greatly intensified (Figure 4). We also perform a placebo test assigning the predicted inflows between 2012 to 2017 to the incidence of diseases between 2009 and 2014. Both robustness tests confirm that predicted inflows is not capturing differential trends for municipalities in close proximity to the border and farther away.====We find that larger forced migration flows cause a higher incidence of vaccine-preventable (including chickenpox and tuberculosis) and sexually transmitted diseases, namely syphilis and HIV for some regions, but no significant changes in the incidence of vector-borne diseases. For vaccine-preventable diseases, our preferred point coefficients suggest that when our measure of ==== increases by one standard deviation, chickenpox and tuberculosis incidence increase by 0.22 and 0.23 cases per 100,000 individuals, respectively. These increases represent sizable effects considering that the mean incidence of chickenpox and tuberculosis during the period of study was 5.58 and 6.57 cases per 100,00 individuals, respectively.====Concerning the effects of migration on STDs, our estimates suggest that when ==== increase by one standard deviation, syphilis incidence increase by 0.088 cases per 100,000 individuals. This increase correspond to alarming effects given that the mean incidence of syphilis during the period of study was 1.73 cases per 100,00 individuals.====The heterogeneous effects by region document that the Caribbean regions is disproportionately carrying the burden of the impact. A one standard deviation increase on ==== results in an increment of 8.8% on the incidence of chickenpox, 15.6% for syphilis and 7.1% for HIV. The historic flows of Colombian migrants in the 80 and 90s from the Caribbean region to Venezuela created strong social networks between both regions, attracting large inflows of migrants.====When examining the effects of migration by age group, we find that the effects of forced migration on chickenpox incidence are disproportionately concentrated in minors (individuals 18 years of age or less) and adults between 19 and 64 years of age. The result makes sense because the vaccine for chickenpox has only been mandatory in Colombia since 2015. We also find that tuberculosis is more prevalent in seniors (ages 65 or more), while syphilis is concentrated in adults (ages 19 to 64), the population that is typically more sexually active.====We also explore two potential transmitting mechanisms: contact between migrants and locals upon arrival, and changes in the composition of the local population brought by out-migration of natives. Our results suggest that contact with infected migrants is the main potential driver. First, chickenpox, and syphilis spread from the first month up to five to six months upon the arrival of migrants. Second, the incidence of chickenpox occurred in municipalities in which the incidence of the disease was below the national mean in 2016 (before the upsurge of migrants started) and in municipalities in which the disease had been already eradicated. Third, natives did not respond to the inflow of migrants by out-migrating and thus the increase in the incidence of chickenpox, tuberculosis, and syphilis is not the result of changes in the composition of the population or the spread of the disease by internal migration.====Our estimates include fixed effects for municipality, month-year, and department-year, and as such, they are not sensitive to time-invariant differences between municipalities, aggregate time trends, or regional time trends. We also include controls for multiple weather proxies, interacted with altitude, which control for negative income shocks as well as geographic and weather conditions that may facilitate the spread of the disease, as well as interactions of year time fixed effects and a rich set of pre-existing municipal characteristics. These pre-existing municipal characteristics include proxies of economic growth (night light density and public income), social and economic conditions of the population (poverty rates, informality in labor markets and population density), and proxies for institutional capacity (central government transfers and municipal spending). To account for additional unboservables that may determine the location of migrants and the incidence of diseases, we also control for the shift share of Venezuelans using the 2005 census data interacted by year fixed effects. Our estimates are consequently only threatened by unobservable differences (not controlled for) between municipalities closer and farther away from the migration points of entry, which are also correlated with the time variation in Venezuelan total migration inflows.====To assess this possibility we perform several robustness exercises. First, we test for the effects of forced migration on the incidence of chronic diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension. These diseases are not infectious, and as such, they should not be affected by forced migration. We find no effects of forced migration on these health diagnoses. Second, we carry out tests to identify whether differential trends, prior to the intensification of migration, between municipalities in close proximity to the border and far away are confounding our main the results. We find no evidence of differential trends by proximity to the border.====Our results underline the urgency of implementing massive vaccination campaigns in regions with a high density of migrants and offering full health service access to forced migrants when they arrive at their hosting locations. Access to health services is important to identify and control clusters of contagions. Importantly, health access may not be effective if it does not go hand in hand with regularization of migrants to ensure that they will not refrain from using health services out of fear of facing deportation. For example, the Colombian government has maintained a generous policy of granting free access to emergency and preventive health services to all Venezuelan refugees in the country, independent of their migratory status.==== However, qualitative evidence from focus groups of irregular migrants in Colombia suggests that Venezuelans are afraid to use health services in Colombia out of fear of being identified as irregular migrants and subsequently deported (IPA, 2020).",Forced Migration and the Spread of Infectious Diseases,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016762962100076X,15 July 2021,2021,Research Article,132.0

We document sharply differing gender patterns. Among women, mortality trends improved fairly monotonically with education. Conversely, male trends for the lowest three education quartiles were often similar. For both sexes, the gap in mortality between the top 25 percent and the bottom 75 percent is growing. However, there are many groups for whom these patterns are reversed – with better experiences for the less educated – or where the differences are statistically indistinguishable.","There has long been an interest in the patterns and causes of social disparities in health. Research documenting the gradient between health and socioeconomic status dates back even before the famous Whitehall studies (Marmot et al., 1984; Marmot et al., 1991), with many analyses conducted in recent years.==== Despite considerable research (Lleras-Muney, 2005; Cutler and Lleras-Muney, 2010; Clark and Royer, 2013), there remain unresolved questions regarding the causes of the inverse relationship between educational attainment and mortality. Contemporary studies have also highlighted differences in mortality trends over time by educational group (Meara et al., 2008; Cutler et al., 2011; Montez et al., 2011; Olshansky et al., 2012; Montez et al., 2019a). Recently, particular attention has been paid to reversals in historic progress in reducing death rates. Life expectancy at birth in the United States fell from 78.9 to 78.6 years from 2014 to 2017 (Murphy et al., 2018, National Center for Health Statistics, 2017), the first such three-year decline in a century. This decrease is part of a broader phenomenon emphasized in the influential research of Case and Deaton (2015), highlighting the increased death rates of middle-aged non-Hispanic whites from 1999 to 2013.====In this paper, we study whether the least educated have experienced the most adverse trends in mortality since the beginning of the 21st century. A significant challenge in answering this question is that growing disparities may result from secular increases in educational attainment, such that there is increasing negative selection into the lowest schooling categories (Dowd and Hamoudi, 2014; Bound et al., 2015). Individuals who, in previous cohorts, would have failed to complete high school may now be high school graduates or even college-educated. These compositional changes could theoretically increase death rates for ==== education groups, even with no overall change. In principle, analyzing mortality at fixed percentiles of the distribution of educational attainment will account for such shifts. However, the information needed to construct death rates by percentile is inconsistently reported across data sources, both in a given year and over time, complicating such efforts.====We make progress on this question by constructing quartiles of educational attainment using population and death data combined with information from Census Bureau surveys. Our distributions of educational attainment are based on single years of schooling for subgroups stratified by sex, race/ethnicity (hereafter simply “race”), and five-year age ranges. We then use linear regression to quantify how mortality trends vary from 2001 to 2017 across education quartiles. For clarity of exposition, we hereafter use the terms “death rates” or “log death rates” to distinguish between absolute versus relative changes and “mortality” to indicate more general experiences that are consistent across both measures.====We find that the relationship between mortality trends and education varies sharply by gender. For women, the magnitudes of the mean reductions in relative death rates have generally increased monotonically with education. Conversely, males in the three lowest education quartiles often have fairly similar experiences. The gap in mortality between the top 25 percent and the bottom 75 percent is growing for both men and women. However, these averages conceal substantial heterogeneity across groups. We document that these patterns are frequently reversed within sex-age-race groups, such that lower education quartiles experienced larger mortality reductions than their more highly educated counterparts. These findings are robust to a number of extensions and sensitivity checks.====Ours is not the first analysis to attempt to adjust for changes in the distribution of education over time. Bound et al. (2015) employ somewhat similar methods to construct quartiles of educational attainment and compare life expectancy between the lowest quartile and the top three combined in 1990 and 2010.==== They find that the bottom quartile of white women experienced increased death rates, while trends for low-educated white men were flat. The top three quartiles generally experienced large improvements. Goldring et al. (2016) focus on changes in the gradient between education and mortality, rather than changes at specific percentiles, using a non-parametric test. They indicate that the gradient has widened for women but fail to find evidence of this pattern for men. Most recently, Novosad et al. (2020) develop a partial identification approach to bound changes in mortality rates between 1992 and 2018. They argue that mortality increases are concentrated in the bottom decile of the educational distribution for both blacks and whites. Conversely, we find that adverse mortality experiences extend throughout the bottom quartile for women and the lower three quartiles for men, on average, but with considerable heterogeneity across groups.====Our results provide a more complete picture of recent mortality trends among the full U.S. population than the studies just cited by including Hispanics and other races in addition to whites and non-Hispanic blacks (hereafter “blacks”), and using recent data, which is important given rapidly changing mortality trends.==== We also supply a comprehensive analysis of the frequency with which mortality trends are not monotonic in education, and we demonstrate that the results obtained using fixed education categories (e.g., high school graduates), rather than education quartiles, will often be incorrect in important ways. We believe that our approach to addressing compositional change provides results that are complementary to other recent work on this topic, corroborating certain patterns and providing new insights on how the gradient between education and mortality has changed differently for demographic groups. Better understanding these trends and heterogeneity of the patterns across groups is of direct interest for those concerned about disparities in health, and also has implications for the incidence of programs like Medicare and Social Security that are linked to longevity.",Has mortality risen disproportionately for the least educated?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629621000795,9 July 2021,2021,Research Article,133.0

Leading health authorities have recommended interventions targeting early life nutrition, which have been shown to be highly cost-effective and with potential implications for well-being through the life cycle.==== Although the prevalence of nutritional deficits has globally decreased in the last decades, deficiencies in micronutrients such as Vitamin A, iron, and iodine are still far too common. Iodine deficiency alone is estimated to affect more than 240 million children worldwide (Andersson et al., 2012). The deficiency of this micronutrient during pregnancy, in particular, can cause permanent brain damage and harm the mental development of the offspring (Pharoah, Connolly, 1987, Zimmermann, Jooste, Pandav, 2008). In fact, it is considered the leading cause of preventable mental retardation in the world and thus a major target of global health authorities. In this paper, we investigate some of the long-term consequences of a large-scale iodine supplementation program in Tanzania, a setting where almost one-half of the population suffered from iodine deficiency.====Existing research on the long-run impacts of iodine deficiency has focused nearly exclusively on the United States (Adhvaryu, Bednar, Molina, Nguyen, Nyshadham, 2018, Feyrer, Politi, Weil, 2017) and Switzerland (Politi, 2014). However, the highest prevalence of iodine deficiency is in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, where many children grow up in conditions of extreme poverty. Though the biological benefits of iodine and other nutritional interventions are well known (Cao, Jiang, Dou, Rakeman, Zhang, O’Donnell, Ma, Amette, DeLong, DeLong, 1994, Isa, Alias, Kadir, Ali, 2000, Pharoah, Connolly, 1987), it is unclear whether such interventions can improve individuals’ long-term economic prospects in low-income settings. In the presence of credit constraints and the absence of a well-functioning public education system, even relatively large changes in cognitive capacity may have limited or only short-lived impacts on human capital. While some studies have examined the short-term impacts of iodine deficiency on student outcomes such as test scores (Deng, Lindeboom, Field, Robles, Torero, 2009), they do not speak directly to the question of whether such gains are sustained or whether they will ultimately have long-term impacts on the subsequent success of children in the labor market later in life. A good examination of this question is critical not only for prevention and cost-effective policy design but for our understanding of whether individuals in the world’s poorest regions are caught in nutrition-based poverty traps (Strauss and Thomas, 1998).====This paper sheds new light on this question by examining whether and to what extent iodine supplementation early in life affects completed education, employment outcomes, and occupational attainment in one of the poorest regions in the world. In 1986, the government of Tanzania launched a large-scale iodine supplementation program to control the high prevalence of iodine deficiency in the country. The program distributed iodized oil capsules (IOC) in afflicted districts, giving high priority to women of childbearing age and young children.==== Depending on the dosage, supplementation with IOC can offer protection against fetal iodine deficiency for approximately four years, so children conceived just before or around three years after the campaign are likely to have received some fetal protection. Distribution campaigns were scheduled to begin in 1986, with additional doses taking place in subsequent years. However, there were several delays in many districts due largely to administrative issues —i.e., the time required for the central government and local offices to coordinate a distribution system. Between 1986 and 1994, approximately 5 million mothers and children received supplementation with IOC, and follow-up surveys suggest that prevalence rates of goiter fell by more than half soon after program implementation (Peterson, 2000).====We exploit variation in ==== and ==== the campaigns took place, as well as the expected duration from the dosage, to form the basis of our research design. Depending on the date of the distribution campaign, some cohorts were exposed ==== to the program, whereas others were exposed only after birth. Individuals exposed in utero or even during the first years of life had more to gain from the program in comparison to those who were already “too old” at the time of the campaign. Our empirical strategy, therefore, compares cohorts based on their place of birth, and their year of birth relative to the IOC campaign to identify the long-run impacts of the program in a difference-in-differences framework. The variation in the timing of the campaigns and date of birth allows us to calculate the impacts of the program at different ages of exposure —i.e., from ==== to the first years of life.====We begin by estimating the impact of the program on completed education. We find that individuals who were exposed in early-life to IOC acquired an additional 0.17 years of education and are 2 percentage points more likely to complete secondary school, effects that represent respectively about 2.5 and 12 percent relative to the baseline. Examining the timing of these impacts, we find that the results are driven by exposure during the ==== period, with little to no differential benefits from exposure after birth. This result is consistent with the view that an inadequate supply of iodine during the ==== period can have irreversible consequences independently of subsequent supplementation.====We then examine the effects of the program on labor market outcomes. The estimates suggest that ==== exposure to IOC increases occupational skill scores, increases the probability of being employed in a position belonging to a skilled occupation, and reduces the likelihood of self-employment in agricultural activities. In contrast, we do not find statistically significant or meaningful impacts on the likelihood of working. This suggests that iodine supplementation affected individuals’ labor market outcomes by shifting employment shares from agriculture towards jobs that typically demand more skilled labor and have higher economic returns. The estimates indicate that skilled employment rates increased by about 1.1 percentage points (or 5 percent relative to the sample mean).====A limitation of our labor market analysis is that we have no information on income in the main dataset, and other sources of data where this information is available have limited sample sizes or lack other important information to identify the extent to which each cohort was exposed to the program. To provide estimates of program impacts on potential income wages and place our results in perspective, we predict income for an individual in our main sample based on his/her occupation, gender and location of residence, as in Bleakley (2010). We find significant gains in this occupation-based income score. Exposed cohorts have occupational-income wages that are about 2.1 percent higher relative to unexposed individuals. For comparison, one of the most successful interventions targeting explicitly education in the context of a developing country impacts wages by 1.5 to 2.7 percent (Duflo, 2001). Overall, these results suggest that the improvements in occupational attainment induced by the IOC program translate into statistically meaningful differences in income wages.====While our estimates suggest strong impacts on education and labor market outcomes, we find no evidence that the program had a meaningful effect on long-run physical disabilities. Although point estimates are in general negative, they are small and statistically indistinguishable from zero. These results are in agreement with the medical literature indicating that iodine deficiency does not have a first-order effect on physical health outcomes (Allen and Gillespie, 2001). We take this finding as suggestive evidence that the program affected education and labor market outcomes by affecting the middle of the ”health” distribution rather than the extreme left tail of the physical/cognitive health distribution.====Our quasi-experimental results rest crucially on the assumption that the outcomes of individuals in districts with varying IOC status would have had similar trends in the absence of the program. We provide a variety of evidence supporting the plausibility of this identifying assumption. In particular, we show that the timing of the campaigns is uncorrelated with a number of baseline district characteristics. This is consistent with the narrative that the variation in IOC status across districts stemmed largely from logistical issues rather than from expectations about future local development prospects (Peterson, 2000). Another natural concern with our empirical strategy is that different quality parents may try to influence the timing of conception in response to IOC campaigns, potentially changing the composition of women giving birth. We show that program exposure does not predict a number of predetermined maternal characteristics or cohort sizes, which is in line with previous research documenting that parents were unlikely to selectively change their fertility behavior in response to IOC campaigns (Adhvaryu and Nyshadham, 2016). Finally, the lack of correlation between program exposure at older ages and subsequent adult outcomes suggests that the estimated effects are not driven by preexisting trends in the outcomes of interest. Collectively, these findings support the validity of our empirical strategy and reinforce our interpretation that iodine deficiency early in life has important implications for adult outcomes.====This study relates to a large literature that examines the link between initial conditions and the long-run evolution of human capital accumulation (for reviews, see Currie and Almond (2011), Almond and Currie (2011), and Almond et al. (2018)). Recent studies have focused on the long-term consequences of physical health conditions in early-life (Gensowski et al., 2019), antibiotic availability in infancy (Bhalotra and Venkataramani, 2015), cash or in-kind transfer programs (Aizer, Eli, Ferrie, Lleras-Muney, 2016, Hoynes, Schanzenbach, Almond, 2016), and changes in key environmental conditions (Bhalotra, Diaz-Cayeros, Miller, Miranda, Venkataramani, 2017, Karbownik, Wray, 2019). As mentioned above, evidence on the long-run consequences of iodine deficiency comes from developed economies, such as the United States and Switzerland. We add to the literature by providing new evidence on this question using data for Sub-Saharan Africa, a region characterized by the very high prevalence of iodine deficiency.==== Hence, our findings are relevant for understanding the long-term impacts of early life iodine deficiency in areas where this is a major social problem. Compared to previous studies, we find effects that tend to be much larger in magnitude. For example, Feyrer et al. (2017) and Adhvaryu et al. (2018) find limited effects on long-run educational attainment in the United States.==== This confirms the importance of studying the effects of such nutritional intervention in a setting with a high prevalence of iodine deficiency and low levels of human capital accumulation.====We are aware of other studies examining the consequences of nutritional interventions in low-income settings, including Hoddinott et al. (2008) and Maluccio et al. (2009) for four villages in Guatemala, Linnemayr and Alderman (2011) for three regions in rural Senegal, and Carneiro et al. (2020) for Northern Nigeria. These studies examine multifaceted interventions that directly affect childhood nutrition in general as well as other inputs recognized as important in the production function of infant health (such as health information or cash transfers).==== Given the design of these interventions, it is not possible to identify the role of specific deficiencies in shaping children’s future outcomes. Identifying the role of specific nutritional deficiencies is important for cost-effective policy design in areas where such deficiencies are endemic. Moreover, with exception of Hoddinott et al. (2008) and Maluccio et al. (2009), these studies tend to focus on children’s short-run education outcomes such as test scores and do not examine the long-run repercussions on labor market outcomes. We focus on the role of a large-scale intervention targeting a specific nutritional deficiency, which covered nearly the universe of the afflicted population. Importantly, we document longer-run implications of this type of intervention by examining labor market outcomes in adulthood.====Finally, the findings of this paper also connect to a large literature examining the factors that facilitate a structural shift of employment out of agriculture in developing countries. Existing work has emphasized the contemporaneous impacts of new agricultural technologies (Bustos et al., 2016), trade liberalization episodes (McCaig and Pavcnik, 2018), and changes in relative prices of factors of production across sectors (Hornbeck and Naidu, 2014). Our results suggest that early-life interventions to foster human capital investments can contribute to the transition from low productivity farming to more productive, diverse jobs in a setting in Sub-Saharan Africa, exactly the region with the greatest potential for structural change. Since these investments take a long time to materialize into increased human capital, they could contribute to structural transformation only in the long run.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides background information about the consequences of iodine deficiency and the supplementation program. In sections 3 and 4, we describe our data and empirical strategy respectively. Section 5 presents the empirical results, including robustness checks. Section 6 includes an interpretation of the magnitude of the results.

Proposed mechanisms often focus on spot differences in employee productivity or employer preferences, neglecting the dynamic nature of human capital development and addiction. In this paper, we formulate a dynamic model of young workers as they transition from schooling to the labor market, a period in which the lifetime trajectory of wages is being developed. We estimate the model with data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1997 Cohort, and we simulate the model under counterfactual scenarios that isolate the contemporaneous effects of smoking from dynamic differences in human capital accumulation and occupational selection. Results from our preferred model, which accounts for unobserved heterogeneity in the joint determination of smoking, human capital, labor supply, and wages, suggest that continued heavy smoking in young adulthood results in a wage penalty at age 30 of 15.9% and 15.2% for women and men, respectively. These differences are much smaller than the raw difference in means in wages at age 30. We show that the contemporaneous effect of heavy smoking net of any life-cycle effects explains 62.9% of the female smoking wage gap but only 20.4% of the male smoking wage gap.","Smoking cigarettes is associated with well-documented expected longevity (Darden, Gilleskie, Strumpf, 2018, Doll, Peto, Boreham, Gray, Sutherland, 2004) and health care expenditure (Sloan, Ostermann, Conover, Taylor, Picone, 2006, Xu, Bishop, Kennedy, Simpson, Pechacek, 2015) effects. In addition, smokers earn between 2% and 24% lower wages than nonsmokers (Auld, 2005, Grafova, Stafford, 2009, van Ours, 2004), but neither the magnitude nor the mechanisms behind the smoking wage gap are well understood. A simple set of explanations is that smokers are less productive due to higher rates of absenteeism and illness, and they generate higher health care costs, which may be particularly important to firms that self-insure.==== Similarly, employers may have preferences (increasingly over time) for nonsmokers, and the smoking wage gap may emerge because labor market opportunities are less forthcoming to smokers (Hotchkiss, Pitts, July 2013, Roulin, Bhatnagar, 2018). While the literature has focused on these types of static mechanisms, differences in wages are inherently a dynamic process: smoking behavior and human capital formation begin at young ages, and these endogenous states influence decisions regarding education, labor supply, smoking, and occupation. Failing to account for the joint determination of these histories will lead to biased estimates of the smoking wage gap. Furthermore, there is little empirical evidence on the importance of these life-cycle mechanisms relative to static explanations, especially in early-career workers for whom human capital is still developing.====We estimate a dynamic model of human capital accumulation, wage determination, and smoking behavior to decompose static and life-cycle mechanisms behind the smoking wage gap. In our model, state variables that capture past smoking behavior, work decisions, and human capital accumulation influence the joint decisions to work, smoke, and seek education. Conditional on working, we observe wages and occupational task requirements, which we define as factors that characterize occupations on the basis of mental reasoning, social skills, and physical strenuousness.==== While task requirements shed light on productivity differences as a mechanism for the smoking wage gap, explicitly modeling the sequence of school enrollment decisions characterizes the extent to which those who choose to smoke accumulate lower human capital. An important feature of our dynamic empirical model is the treatment of unobserved heterogeneity, which we allow to be flexibly correlated across behavioral and outcome equations. If, for example, unobserved factors cause some individuals to be more likely to select into physically demanding jobs and to be more likely to start (and continue) smoking, we allow for this correlation. Finally, given that there are approximately 55 million ==== smokers in the United States, our model allows us to investigate the extent to which wages of former smokers converge to those of nonsmokers (Creamer et al., 2018).====We estimate our model with geocoded data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1997 Cohort, which allows us to (a) evaluate competing mechanisms for the wage gap among a modern cohort of workers and (b) track the initial wage trajectories for smokers and nonsmokers, beginning with schooling and proceeding through a person’s early career. In our raw data, the smoking wage gap between nonsmokers and near-daily smokers emerges by age 23 and grows to roughly 40% for women and 25% for men by age 30. To demonstrate the importance of accounting for observed and unobserved heterogeneity, we simulate our estimated model in which we impose different patterns of smoking behavior from age 16 through age 30 while updating state variables that capture past smoking, work, and education decisions. These simulations suggest that the selectivity-corrected age 30 smoking wage gap is 15.9% and 15.2% for women and men, respectively, although the mechanisms differ substantially by gender. The dramatic reduction between our simulated smoking results and those from the raw data is due to the strong positive correlation in factors that drive abstinence from smoking and human capital accumulation. These findings are broadly consistent with the literature (Auld, 2005, Grafova, Stafford, 2009, van Ours, 2004), but they stem from a model-based approach which is conducive to isolating mechanisms.====Our simulated results reflect the total marginal effect of smoking on wages – the combination of static and life-cycle mechanisms. To separate the static mechanisms of smoking on wages, we simulate our model, updating schooling, employment, and occupation decisions/outcomes as though an individual does not smoke while imposing different smoking behaviors in the determination of wages. Thus, wages progress as a function of nonsmoker employment, education, and occupation paths, but, in some simulations, as though individuals were smoking when wages are determined. We call this the contemporaneous effect of smoking on wages, and our simulation results imply that this contemporaneous effect explains 62.9% the total female smoking wage gap but only 20.4% of the male gap. That is, the majority of the smoking wage gap for men stems from factors that are pre-determined when wages are set; for women, on the other hand, the contemporaneous effect explains the majority of the smoking wage gap. This finding - that mechanisms behind the smoking wage gap are very different for men versus women - extends the literature that the smoking wage gap differs by gender (van Ours, 2004).====Part of the difference in contemporaneous versus life-cycle effects by gender is due to occupation. For women at age 30, the simulated smoking wage gap is increasing in the amount of mental reasoning required in an occupation - the smoking wage penalty is approximately 36.6% larger for women in the most mentally taxing occupations relative to the least - but invariant to its physical strenuousness. Similarly, the simulated wage penalty is 24.4% larger for socially demanding jobs. For men, the smoking wage gap is nearly 60% larger in the most mentally taxing jobs and 36% larger for the most socially demanding jobs; however, the gap ==== in the degree of physical strenuousness. The smoking wage gap is roughly 14.8% smaller for men in the most physically demanding occupations relative to the least. Our findings with respect to physical strenuousness also suggest that productivity and health differences, which should be exacerbated as an occupation becomes more physically demanding, are unlikely to drive the smoking wage gap for either men or women. For men, the fact that the smoking wage gap is smaller for more physically strenuous jobs creates an incentive for male smokers to select into more physically strenuous occupations. As educational attainment translates to more mentally rigorous, more socially demanding, and less physically strenuous occupations, the opportunity cost of an additional year of schooling for male smokers is higher than for female smokers.====Both the magnitude and the mechanisms behind the smoking wage gap have significant policy relevance. Not only does smoking have implications for individual lifetime earnings, but the external implications for lower income tax revenues and productivity could be significant. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analyses already take these consequences into account (e.g., MacMonegle et al., 2018), and our results may inform future regulatory action, including regulatory action with respect to substitute nicotine delivery products such as e-cigarettes (Cotti et al., 2020). Accounting for selection into smoking and individual heterogeneity, our analysis provides a more accurate estimate of the direct impact of smoking on wages, and we find that while the smoking wage gap is larger for women than for men, the returns to quitting are also more immediate and significant for women.",The dynamics of the smoking wage penalty,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629621000709,26 June 2021,2021,Research Article,135.0

Although competition may benefit consumers through better access to MRI scanners, it also causes additional physician-induced demand.","Physicians may take advantage of asymmetric information and overtreat patients, a practice typically known as ==== or ====. Although it is well documented that hospital competition affects the quality and price of treatment, little is known about how competition affects such opportunistic behavior. This paper, therefore, empirically investigates physician-induced demand arising from competition among hospitals.====As discussed in Baker (2010), physician-induced demand may be more prominent at hospitals that purchase new medical equipment. This additional equipment may intensify local hospital competition and create a so-called ====, which in turn increases physician-induced demand at ==== hospitals as they compensate for their loss of revenue. We focus on this negative externality effect caused by competition, which we call ====, and investigate it in the context of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) adoption and usage. Ignoring the indirect effects of competition on the surrounding institutions causes underestimation of the social cost of new equipment adoption. By taking this channel into account, we can better understand the consequences of hospital competition and help find ways to design better healthcare policies.====To this end, we use administrative data on all medical institutions in Japan and focus on MRI treatment, which provides a suitable setting for identifying physician-induced demand.==== Japan has offered universal health coverage since the 1960s, allowing all citizens to (i) go to any medical institution in Japan and (ii) receive care at the same government-regulated price for the same treatment. In addition to these institutional features, the panel structure of our data enables us to examine how MRI adoptions at nearby hospitals affect the numbers of patients and MRI scans performed, without worrying about price differentials.====We first examine whether the business-stealing effect exists in the MRI scanning market. Our estimation results show that a hospital’s patient count drops by up to 6.6 percentage points for an additional MRI scanner purchased by one of the surrounding hospitals. These business-stealing effects are limited to MRI purchases by public hospitals. We then investigate whether the hospitals that lose patients respond by performing MRI scans more often to compensate for the reduction in patients. To provide such evidence, we define the ==== as the fraction of patients who receive MRI scans, and we demonstrate that the conversion rate increases after surrounding public hospitals purchase MRI scanners. This finding confirms the existence of ====. Our estimation results further show that hospitals perform roughly the same number of MRI scans, regardless of changes in the number of patients.====If increases in both the conversion rate and the number of surrounding MRI scanners are driven by an increase in unobserved local demand, there could be a concern that we might overestimate this competition-driven physician-induced demand. However, our data reveal that purchases of MRI scanners by public hospitals are not correlated with changes in local demand, which eliminates this endogeneity concern. Based on those findings, we further quantify physician-induced demand in a more general sense: how physicians change their behavior when the number of patients changes exogenously. We take an instrumental variable (IV) approach, using the MRI purchases of public hospitals as an instrument for the changes in the number of patients, and confirm that physicians perform MRI scans more often when the number of patients decreases. We then translate this physician-induced demand into the increase in healthcare expenditure. Our estimates suggest that total annual healthcare expenditure increases to 11 billion Japanese yen, which implies that roughly 7% of MRI-related expenditures are caused by physician-induced demand.====This paper contributes to two strands of literature. First, we contribute to the literature on supplier-induced demand by adding a novel source of identification, externalities from surrounding medical institutions, which no studies have yet explored. Supplier-induced demand has been studied extensively both in the context of the healthcare industry (Chandra, Staiger, 2007, Geruso, Layton, 2020, Kessler, McClellan, 1996) and elsewhere (Balafoutas et al., 2013). We provide new evidence for physician-induced demand and quantify its economic significance by investigating the MRI scanning market, where Baker (2010) and Clemens and Gottlieb (2014) also find physician-induced demand. In terms of the mechanism, the closest paper to ours is Gruber and Owings (1996). They exploit the exogenous change in the number of patients caused by the fall in the fertility rate as a source of physician-induced demand for C-sections. Although all existing studies view physician-induced demand as a phenomenon at each institution, this paper attempts to identify physician-induced demand that stems from interactions and competition among medical institutions. Theoretically, our definition of physician-induced demand follows Dranove (1988): Physicians exploit information asymmetries/advantages to induce patients to consume more care than necessary. We consider a model similar to that of Xiang (2020) and use the changes in conversion rates as outcome variables.====The second strand of literature is hospital/physician competition. Katz (2013), Gaynor and Town (2011) and Gaynor et al. (2015) summarize the existing studies. Many studies have found that competition affects quality and prices. For example, Dranove et al. (1992); Kessler and McClellan (2000); and Bloom et al. (2015) find that hospital competition increases healthcare quality and Gravelle et al. (2016) finds that hospital competition decreases prices. Our results contrast with the existing studies by showing another aspect of competition. Namely, we provide evidence that competition changes the physicians’ incentive to engage in opportunistic behavior and induces physician-induced demand. Entry and equipment adoption have been studied intensively in the healthcare industry as well. Though the business-stealing effect is a central issue related to competition and entry, and has been studied both theoretically (Mankiw and Whinston, 1986) and empirically (Davis, 2006), not much attention has been paid to the business-stealing effect in the healthcare industry, except for Schmidt-Dengler (2006) who considers a dynamic structural model of MRI adoption. This paper, therefore, is the first to establish some evidence that hospital competition creates business-stealing effects, which further induces physician-induced demand.====This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the institutional background and the data. We use the Japanese MRI scanning market to show in the first part of Section 3 that there are business-stealing effects associated with MRI purchases at surrounding hospitals and these business-stealing effects cause further physician-induced demand there, which verifies our competition-driven physician-induced demand hypothesis. Taking advantage of our findings in the first half of Section 3, we then attempt to identify physician-induced demand in a more general sense in the subsequent section. Section 4 provides various robustness checks, and Section 5 concludes.",Competition-driven physician-induced demand,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629621000734,23 June 2021,2021,Research Article,136.0

Using several new administrative data sources, we evaluate the effect of a stricter limit introduced in Scotland in 2014. This reduction had no effect on drink driving and road collisions. Estimates from a supply-of-offenses function suggests that the reform did not have much ex-ante scope for sizeable effects. The unavailability of cheaper alternative means of transportation and weak law enforcement seem to have been the main channels behind the lack of an impact. We find no externality on a wide range of domains, from alcohol consumption to criminal activities other than drink driving."," — On the 5th of December 2014 Scotland reduced the legal drink drive limit (DDL) from 80 to 50 milligrams per 100 millilitres of blood.==== The limit in the rest of the United Kingdom (England, Wales, and Northern Ireland) did not change and continues to be at the same level at the time of our analysis. While the Scottish limit decreased, the punishment for being caught and found guilty of driving above it remained unaltered both in Scotland and in the other three UK constituent nations. The first objective of this paper is to estimate the impact of the DDL reduction on road traffic collisions. After assembling many different administrative data sources, some never used before, and using a variety of research designs, we conclude that the reform had no impact on accidents. The second objective of the paper is to understand why this was the case. The unavailability of cheaper alternative means of transportation and weak law enforcement seem to have been the main channels behind the lack of an impact.====Motor vehicle accidents are a major public health problem worldwide. In 2016, there were 1.35 million road traffic deaths globally, with a heavier burden of these deaths falling on men and the young (World Health Organization, 2018). Even though there have been large reductions in automobile crashes over recent decades in the UK, they continue to be a considerable burden on health. For instance, in 2018, over 160,000 casualties from road traffic collisions were reported, consistently representing the second or third leading cause of death among Britons aged 5–34 in the last 30 years. Driving under the influence of alcohol is the main risk factor for road crashes everywhere, and a dose-response relation is systematically observed between blood alcohol concentration and road traffic accidents (Francesconi, James, 2019, Levitt, Porter, 2001). Medical research from field and laboratory studies suggests that lowering the BAC level from 0.08 to 0.05 would significantly curtail risk taking among drivers and stop people from being killed as a result (Dirk, Seeland-Schulze, Hecker, Schneider, 2007, van Dyke, Fillmore, 2017, Fell, Voas, 2006, Fell James, Scherer, 2017, Phillips, Brewer, 2011).====Limiting BAC for drivers, therefore, has become a key policy tool used by governments across the world in their attempt to save lives on the road. Having a limit of 0.05 BAC is one of the criteria for best practice set out by the World Health Organization (WHO). To date, 2.3 billion people in 45 countries have drink drive laws that align with WHO best practice. In the US, since 2017, all states have a standard limit of 0.08 BAC (except Utah, which lowered it to 0.05 at the end of 2018), and have adopted policies of lower limits for young or novice drivers. An overall abatement to 0.05 BAC has been discussed but not yet agreed (e.g., National Transportation Safety Board, 2013). In 2001, the European Commission recommended that all member states should adopt a legal maximum limit of 0.05 BAC or lower, for drivers and riders of all motorized vehicles (Official Journal of the European Communities, 2001).==== In the UK, the government-commissioned ==== on the legal framework of drink and drug driving concluded with the recommendation to cut the legal maximum BAC from 0.08 to 0.05 (North, 2010). With the 2014 DDL reform, Scotland adopted this recommendation, with the explicit intent to make roads safer and save lives. As of July 2020 among all European countries, only England, Wales, and Northern Ireland have a standard drink drive limit greater than the recommended 0.05 BAC.====What does a reduction from 0.08 to 0.05 BAC mean in practice for an average consumer planning to drive? Although this is difficult to pin down with precision, most of the information available to the public suggests that a healthy adult man of mean weight can consume two UK pints of 5% alcohol-by-volume (ABV) beer, or two large glasses of 13% ABV wine, over a meal and be below the 0.08 BAC limit.==== The stricter 0.05 BAC threshold implies a reduction to one pint of beer or one large glass of wine. For a healthy adult woman of mean weight, all figures should be roughly halved.====One critical implication of this reduction is for the alcohol industry, which plays a vital role in the Scottish economy and contribute approximately 4% to total Scottish GDP on average since 2000 (O’Connor, 2018).==== Scotland’s case is important also because of the country’s historically high mortality rates across all ages compared to the rest of Europe and most other industrialized nations. For women and men aged 15–74, Scotland has recorded the highest all-cause age-standardized mortality rates since the early 1980s, including liver disease and cirrhosis, which are specific causes of death typically associated with heavy drinking (Whyte and Ajetunmobi, 2012). Consequently, life expectancy in Scotland, whether at birth or at age 65, has been among the lowest among OECD countries, with gaps of at least 4–5 years with respect to most of the other advanced economies (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2019); National Records of Scotland, 2019). Some of the arguments leading up to the 2014 reform were motivated by this hard pre-existing reality (Granville, Mulholland, Scottish Health Actionon Alcohol Problems).==== — The explicit goal of the lower drink drive limit was to save lives, improving safety on the roads, reducing road traffic accidents and deaths, and lowering convictions.==== Economic theory suggests that, ceteris paribus, if the actual or perceived probability of conviction goes up (because the DDL has been lowered) or the probability of punishment increases, we should expect to see a ==== in drink drive offenses and, because of the BAC-collision relationship illustrated by the empirical literature, a reduction in motor vehicle accident rates (Becker, 1968, Becker, Kevin, 1988, Ehrlich, 1973, Hansen, 2015, Levitt, Porter, 2001, Sah, 1991). In the DDL context, alternative models based on behavioral insights may lead to similar predictions on traffic collisions, even though they could identify different mechanisms.==== The BAC limits, however, are set at levels low enough that might not require us to invoke cognitive impairment, limited self-control, weak wills, or the operation of visceral influences on drink driving. Nevertheless, testing one theory against another goes beyond the scope of this paper. Rather, we aim to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the reform on the one hand and a unifying, rigorous understanding of the channels behind its effects on the other. For this latter aspect of the analysis, we use intuitions from both standard theory and behavioral models.====To evaluate the impact of the reform, we rely on highly detailed geographical data and new administrative information defined at the level of local authorities, of which there are 347 in England and Wales and 31 in Scotland.==== In the attempt to address the issue of noncommon trends between Scotland and the rest of Britain as persuasively as possible, limit the role played by unobserved local differences, and reduce the scope for omitted variables bias, we compare the results from three approaches, namely, models based on difference-in-differences, spatial regression discontinuity design, and synthetic control methods. We supplement both the difference-in-difference analysis using a linear panel event-study design following Freyaldenhoven et al. (2019) and the synthetic control approach combining matching and synthetic control estimators through model averaging as proposed by Kellogg et al. (2019). All estimates reveal that the lower Scottish limit had no impact on any type of road accident, from fatal crashes to collisions involving just slight injuries. For the first time for Britain, we have access to data with alcohol involvement and confirm the null result also for drink drive accidents.====This evidence holds true for various subgroups of the population (e.g., young men), and whether we consider nights, weekends, or multiple vehicle crashes. It is also robust to different definitions of the outcome variable, different functional forms used in estimation, randomization inference, and alternative definitions of drink drive collisions.====Given the relatively small BAC range over which the reform could leverage, we address issues of statistical power by looking at the fraction of accidents that are in the 0.05–0.08 BAC band and by estimating a reduced form version of the supply of offenses, which links BAC levels to the number of road traffic violations and accidents. We find there are no power issues, that is, there are enough accidents in the relevant BAC range to detect statistically significant effects. Nevertheless, the supply-of-offenses analysis reveals only a small alcohol intake-collision elasticity over the same BAC interval. This implies that the reform did not have much scope for a sizeable impact ceteris paribus. The pre-existing DDL was already sufficiently low that further reductions in motor vehicle accidents could not be readily achieved, unless some other factors were triggered (e.g., stricter enforcement).====Two other papers examine the 2014 BAC reduction in Scotland on road accidents estimating difference-in-difference models. Haghpanahan et al. (2019) use weekly motor vehicle accident rates calculated at the ==== level (i.e., one rate for Scotland and one for England and Wales), while (Cooper et al., 2020) compare the whole of Scotland to ten other large regions in England and Wales. Like ours, neither study finds evidence that the change in the law led to lower road accident rates. One concern with both studies is the high level of geographic aggregation, which may overlook time-varying differences within each constituent nation that are important for identification, such as differences in economic conditions. Our work addresses this issue by using a much finer spatial disaggregation whenever possible. Another concern is that there might be unobservables (e.g., alcohol abuse) that affect accident rates and, possibly, even the introduction of the DDL reform, which cannot be accounted for by standard difference-in-difference models. This is the reason why we use multiple methods that rely on different identifying assumptions. Finally, unlike the two previous papers, we examine mechanisms and potential spillovers.====In fact, because of our zero-effect results, examining mechanisms is all the more important. This can allow us not only to understand behavior better but also to inform future policy interventions on how to be more effective. To guide the interpretation as to why the DDL reduction to 0.05 BAC was ineffective, we go back to the framework proposed by Becker (1968) and (Ehrlich (1973) and Ehrlich (1996)), in which potential lawbreakers decide whether to engage in drink driving by carrying out a cost-benefit calculation under uncertainty. Individuals assess whether the expected benefit from drink driving, accounting for the probability of being caught, outweighs the expected cost. In this setup, drink driving is affected by both direct and indirect economic incentives (Draca and Machin, 2015). Among the direct incentives, we consider alternatives to driving under the influence, and explore changes in the availability of alternative means of transportation (e.g., taxis and buses) and their fares. A key indirect mechanism is through deterrence and incapacitation effects. Although the reform did not change the punishment for drink driving, we examine whether the lower limit was accompanied by changes in enforcement, specifically police numbers and breath testing at the roadside, including tests unrelated to road collisions, as well as drink drive arrests and convictions unrelated to traffic accidents. We find that alternative means of transportation were neither more available nor cheaper, and police enforcement was weak. Both channels therefore contribute to the lack of an impact of the reform.====Building on the insights from both the conventional economic model of crime and behavioral models, we then explore the possibility of unintended consequences of the stricter limit. We find the reform led to a greater anti-drink driving sentiment among the public, although this was not enough to induce people to scale back their alcohol consumption or reduce own vehicle usage. There was no increase, but also no abatement, in other types of offenses and criminal activities, including speed limit violations, illegal drug-related crimes, serious assaults, and sexual offenses. We also find no appreciable price and quantity responses from the alcohol and automobile industries.==== — There is a wide economic literature on the impact of various alcohol policies on motor vehicle collisions, with a particular emphasis on traffic fatalities.==== One strand focuses on the impact of alcohol taxes with findings suggesting a negative association (e.g., Chaloupka, Saffer, Grossman, 1993, Ruhm, 1996). Another takes advantage of the changing legal status of drinking by age. For the United States, (Carpenter, Dobkin, 2009, Carpenter, Dobkin, 2011, Carpenter, Dobkin, 2015) find increases in mortality around the age when drinking becomes legal. This increase seems to be driven, in part, by an increase in fatal crashes which go up by 15% at the age of 21.==== Using the census of judicial records on criminal charges filed in Oregon courts, (Hansen and Waddell, 2018) find that crime increases at age 21, especially in the case of assaults lacking in premeditation, alcohol-related offenses, and drink driving.==== This evidence is suggestive more of the impact of heavy alcohol use than of the impact on margins that are closer to legal drinking levels, which DDLs attempt to influence.====Other studies exploit variation in the availability of alcohol through restrictions (or relaxations) on the times of the day or days of the week when alcohol can be sold. Liberalization of Sunday alcohol laws (also known as “blue laws”) have been shown to have had mixed effects on traffic fatalities (Lovenheim, Steefel, 2011, McMillan, Lapham, 2006).==== Stehr (2010) exploits changes of blue laws in 14 states using data from 48 states from 1995 to 2008 and concludes that the repeal led to an increase in highway crash fatalities only in New Mexico. Using variation in the legalization of Sunday packaged alcohol sales across Virginia, (Heaton, 2012) finds no impact on arrests for driving under the influence. In 2005, England and Wales liberalized bar opening hours. Green et al. (2014) find that this change in on-trade availability led to a decrease in road accidents, with the fall concentrated among the young and at times when the policy was expected to have most bite (i.e., at the weekends and during more popular drinking hours). Restrictions of liquor availability in Brazil, in contrast, led to a decline in deaths by car accidents (Biderman et al., 2010).====Besides the already mentioned studies on the 2014 DDL reform in Scotland (Cooper, Gehrsitz, McIntyre, 2020, Haghpanahan, Lewsey, Mackay, McIntosh, Pell, Jones, Fitzgerald, Robinson, 2019), a small strand of research focuses on the effect of BAC limits on road accidents, mainly in the United States. Carpenter (2004) analyzes the impact of zero-tolerance laws for the young, which set stricter BAC limits for individuals under age 21. The results indicate these laws led to a reduction in heavy drinking (for men), but not drink driving. Among the closest papers to ours, Dee (2001) examines the effect of lowering DDLs for all drivers. Using variation across 48 states from 1982 to 1998, he finds that lowering the limit to 0.08 BAC reduced fatal accident rates by 7.2%, implying roughly 1,200 lives saved annually. Eisenberg (2003) confirms this result, estimating that a decline in the legal limit from 0.10 to 0.08 BAC reduced fatal crash rates by 3.1% percent, although it might take a few years for the effect to be observed. Using data on 15 European countries observed between 1991 and 2003 and taking advantage of the reduction in the BAC level down to 0.05, Albalate (2008) finds evidence of a decrease in fatal road accident rates for young drivers in urban areas, but no overall effect.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines the background surrounding the introduction of the 2014 Scottish reform and discusses some of the key factors that affect BAC levels through the way ethanol is absorbed and metabolized. Section 3 describes the data and methods used for the policy evaluation. Section 4 presents the benchmark estimates of the evaluation, checks for heterogenous effects, and shows the results from a broad set of sensitivity exercises and from drink drive crimes unrelated to road accidents. Section 5 discusses issues of statistical power and the results obtained from the estimation of a supply of offenses, which links motor vehicle violations and accidents to BAC levels. Section 6 explores the two main mechanisms suggested by a market model of crime, i.e., alternatives to drink driving and police enforcement of the new limit. Section 7 investigates whether the reform had unintended consequences on multiple domains, such as public attitudes toward drink driving, alcohol consumption, and own vehicle usage, or if it generated undesired spillovers to other crimes and offenses. Section 8 summarizes. Supplementary material on the data and additional results are in the Online Appendix.",None for the Road?

Such policies often aim to improve hospital quality by stimulating competition between hospitals. Previous empirical literature lacks a comprehensive theoretical framework for analysing the effects of report cards. We model a report card policy in a market where two hospitals compete for ==== on quality under regulated prices. The report card policy improves the accuracy of the quality signal observed by ====. Hospitals may improve their published quality scores by costly quality improvement or by selecting healthier patients to treat. We show that increasing information through report cards always increases quality and only sometimes induces selection. Report cards are more likely to increase patient welfare when quality scores are well risk-adjusted, where the cost of selecting patients is high, and the cost of increasing quality is low.","Recent years have seen a proliferation in government policies to increase consumer information in markets for healthcare. These policies involve the introduction of websites publishing indicators of hospital quality. Examples include the NHS service search website in the UK====, Medicare Hospital Compare in the USA====, and the MyHospitals website in Australia.====The market context for these policies is usually characterised by regulated prices and profit seeking (or loss-minimising) hospitals who have an incentive to increase the volume of patients treated. The primary motivation for publishing quality indicators is that they will lead to improvements in hospital quality levels through a competitive process. The quality indicators published on websites are often termed ‘report cards’. These report cards are outcome indicators for patients who have recently been treated at the hospital such as (risk-adjusted) mortality rates or re-admission rates.====A critical insight is that hospitals may be able to improve their quality indicators through two alternative channels: firstly by investing in genuine quality improvement, or secondly by engaging in ‘selecting’ patients who have better outcomes on average. In the second case, the selection has to be on attributes that are unobserved to the risk-adjuster, or the government agency who compiles the indicators. Dranove et al. (2003) wrote the seminal study suggesting that hospitals in New York and Pennsylvania engaged in ‘risk selection’, treating healthier patients on average after the introduction of hospital performance reporting in the form of mortality rates for CABG patients.====The aim of this paper is to develop a model to examine the impact of report card policies on both quality investment and patient selection by hospitals. In the model, there are two hospitals, two types of patients and two time periods. In the first period, each hospital has a monopoly on a quantity of high-severity and low-severity patients and choose how many of each to treat. In the second period, the two hospitals compete on quality for patients who observe quality with an imperfect signal that is influenced by the amount of high-severity patients treated in the first period.==== An increase in the precision of the imperfect signal represents the introduction of a report card policy. The introduction of report cards increases hospitals’ incentives to increase quality and to treat fewer high-severity patients in the first period.====This paper relates to a parallel empirical literature on the effects of hospital report cards (Chen, Meinecke, 2012, Cutler, Huckman, Landrum, 2004, Dranove, Kessler, McClellen, Satterthwaite, 2003, Dranove, Sfekas, 2008, Pope, 2009, Wang, Hockenberry, Chou, Yang, 2012). Previous empirical papers have tested for both quality improvement and patient selection effects of report cards, but with little theoretical framework for the analyses. Previous theoretical models have concentrated on the quality improvement effects of report cards (Gravelle, Sivey, 2010, Huessman, Mimra, 2015, Ma, Mak, 2014), or patient selection effects (Chen, 2011, Mak, 2018). In this paper we provide a framework that allows for both quality improvement and patient selection effects.====An important earlier literature considers the incentives for health care providers to engage in risk selection, cream skimming, or dumping, as a result of imperfectly risk-adjusted reimbursement mechanisms (eg Ma, 1994, Ellis, 1998). Our model abstracts from these issues by assuming reimbursement is perfectly risk-adjusted and considers risk-selection (or dumping) incentives which arise only from hospital quality report cards.====Probably the most relevant previous studies are Gravelle and Sivey (2010), Huessman and Mimra (2015) and Mak (2017) as they all consider imprecise report cards in a context where patients choose between providers based on quality reports. Gravelle and Sivey show how more precise quality reporting increases quality competition, and therefore equilibrium quality levels, except if hospitals have very different quality-production technologies. In this paper we add the possibility of patient selection to Gravelle and Sivey’s model, whilst adopting the reference case in their paper of identical quality production technology. Gravelle and Sivey show that if report cards increase quality, they always increase patient welfare. In contrast, we show that even if report cards increase quality, patient welfare may fall due to risk selection if there are diminishing marginal returns to higher quality. Huessman and Mimra (2015) focuses on report cards in a multi-dimensional quality setting. In common with Gravelle and Sivey (2010), they model quality improvement/investment but not patient selection. As in other multidimensional models (e.g. Dranove and Satterthwaite, 1992), they show how excessive focus on reporting one dimension of quality over others may be welfare-reducing. Mak (2017) shows how different forms of risk adjustment in providers’ quality reports lead to differing incentives to ‘dump’ vulnerable patients who negatively affect quality reports. This is similar to the modelling of risk selection in our paper where providers may choose not to treat a proportion of high-severity patients. Our approach is very different from Mak in that we do not consider the multidimensional signalling function of quality and quantity reports. But we add substantially to the policy relevance of his approach by allowing hospitals to endogenously choose their quality level and therefore allow for the quality-improving effects of report cards.====Our model uses a patient choice model with uniformly distributed information signals about hospital quality from Gravelle and Sivey (2010). The model has similarities to the literature on horizontal product differentiation (Anderson, Palma, Thisse, 1992, Hotelling, 1929, Salop, 1979). In particular the models of Anderson et al. (1992) use a discrete choice model where the error term represents horizontal differentiation. In our model, following Dranove and Satterthwaite (1992), the error term represents imprecise information about hospital quality.====Our results show that increasing patient information about hospital quality (report cards) always increases equilibrium quality levels. Report cards also increase the incentive for hospitals to engage in selection, but selection only becomes positive when information is relatively high. So report cards only sometimes induce or increase the level of patient selection.====Hospital report cards will always improve aggregate patient welfare if we assume a linear relationship between hospital quality and patient utility. Some high-severity patients lose out by not being treated if selection occurs but this effect is outweighed by the increase in quality for patients who are treated. Our welfare analysis shows that report cards increase welfare more strongly when the costs of increasing quality are low, when quality scores are well risk-adjusted, and where the costs of selection are high (eg. where hospitals treatment choices are more rigorously audited for appropriateness).====If there are diminishing returns to quality in patients’ utility functions, there may be an ‘optimum’ level of patient information, beyond which report cards harm aggregate patient welfare as the reduction in the number of patients treated (selection) outweighs the diminishing gains from higher quality. In this case, even if just considering patient welfare, it is not always optimal to increase patient information as much as possible",Hospital report cards: Quality competition and patient selection,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629621000692,17 June 2021,2021,Research Article,138.0

T1D is the second most common childhood chronic physical health condition, inheritability is low, the exact cause is unknown, the onset is unpredictable, and receiving ","Many children are diagnosed with chronic health conditions and the prevalence has greatly increased over time. For example, Van Cleave et al. (2010) found the prevalence of children ever having a reported chronic health condition increased by approximately ten percent across each cohort of children of mothers in the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1979. In the most recent cohort studied the prevalence was 51.5%. One of the reasons to care about this trend is its impact on parental labor supply.====We use a distinctly different identification strategy from the related literature on child health and parental labor supply by focusing on those with a Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) diagnosis in Denmark. T1D has, from an identification viewpoint, a favorable set of features compared with other chronic health conditions. First, it is common enough to study since T1D is, second to asthma, the most common chronic physical health condition in children and adolescents in most of the Western world.==== Second, the exact cause of the disease is unknown and importantly, unlike Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), it is not related to lifestyle. There is only a three percent risk of T1D in children of mothers with T1D and there is only a five percent risk in children with fathers with T1D, so genetics play a smaller role than in other chronic health conditions (Pociot and Lernmark, 2016).==== The disease is characterized by a rapid onset in children and adolescents and affected individuals will die without treatment, meaning the control group should not be contaminated with people who have T1D but are not diagnosed with T1D. At the turn of the 19th century, before insulin treatment was discovered, a patient diagnosed with T1D had an average life expectancy of only two years from diagnosis ((Hakim et al., 2010)). This set of characteristics makes T1D an ideal candidate for studying the impact of child health on parental labor supply.====Using both an event study regression with individual-specific fixed effects and difference-in-differences regressions (with and without individual-specific fixed effects), we show that parental labor supply is impacted even though T1D is not severe enough to qualify for government transfers. Specifically, mothers are more likely to work part-time after diagnosis. The magnitude of the effect is largest in the year of diagnosis, is only about half as large in the year after diagnosis, and then remains about a quarter of the original magnitude two years to ten years after diagnosis. The shift to part-time work leads to a 4-5 percent decline in wage income, which persists at least ten years after the child is diagnosed. We find no corresponding persistent wage decline for fathers, and their labor supply is much less impacted as well.====Given that we find differential impacts for mothers and fathers, we check for evidence consistent with numerous hypotheses as to why this may be the case. Mothers are reducing their labor supply more than fathers regardless of which parent earns more, suggesting economic reasons are unlikely to be driving the results. While neither parent is more likely to have prescriptions for anti-depressants or anti-anxiety medications following the diagnosis, we do find evidence of significant increases in the probability of visiting a psychologist. However, mothers are more likely to visit a psychologist for more years after diagnosis than fathers, suggesting that the diagnosis may impact maternal mental health more than paternal mental health. Lastly, while we do not have time-use data, we discuss evidence consistent with extra demands on parental time by discussing impacts of the diagnosis on school absenteeism and sibling spillovers. Given that mothers are traditionally viewed as caregivers, this may also partially explain why mothers are more likely to work part-time after diagnosis.====The main threat to our identification strategy would be if the unknown cause(s) of T1D is related to parental labor supply. To address this concern, we show that wages prior to diagnosis were on the same level and trend for both treatment and control mothers and fathers. We also run regressions to test whether observable characteristics predict a T1D diagnosis in the next two years. Differences in immigration status lead to a difference between treatment and control mothers (without that variable the joint F-test suggests no overall differences). Thus, we test for differential effects by immigrant status, and cannot rule out similar impacts for native mothers and immigrant mothers. However, differences for fathers are driven by more than immigration status, which means we cannot rule out that impacts on fathers are due to other underlying differences instead of the child's T1D diagnosis. Although, it seems unlikely that these differences in pre-diagnosis characteristics would only lead to differences in labor supply in the year that the child happens to be diagnosed with T1D.====We are not the first to consider how child health impacts parental labor supply. Previous research tends to find worse child health is associated with reduced maternal labor supply across multiple countries (see, for example, Salkever (1982), Breslau et al. (1982), Powers (2003), Porterfield, (2002), Corman et al. (2005), Baydar et al. (2007), Cidav et al. (2012), and Burton et al. (2017)). van den Berg and Buchmueller (2012) find heterogenous treatment effects across types of childhood health conditions such that physical health conditions and conditions where children cannot take care of themselves lead to large reductions in maternal labor supply. Wolfe and Hill (1995) conduct simulations to find that wage subsidies or reductions in welfare would not greatly impact labor supply for mothers of disabled children because the impact of their child's health is so large.====Some papers find that child health is associated with worse labor market outcomes for both parents. For example, Kvist, Nielsen and Simonsen (2013) find reductions in labor supply for both parents when a child is diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD), although this is partly due to differences in socio-economic background and mental health. (Derigne and Porterfield (2017)) also find impacts of child health on both parents, but that the magnitude is smaller for fathers. This is consistent with the finding in McCall and Starr (2018), which focuses specifically on autism.====However, Frijters et al. (2009) note that most studies have not been able to address the endogeneity concerns. They therefore contribute to the literature by using child handedness as an instrumental variable to find that developmental delays cause reductions in maternal labor force participation. Gunnsteinsson and Steingrimsdottir (2019) estimate plausibly causal impacts for conditions that qualify for government transfers in Denmark by studying chronic health conditions that are congenital or occur early in life and cannot be screened for during pregnancy. They also control for many pre-child characteristics to address any imbalance between the treatment and control parents. A necessary condition for eligibility for government transfers is that the child, due to the disability, requires home care (ie, cannot attend school, daycare institutions, etc.) and that it is determined that the care is best provided by the parents.==== T1D differs from developmental delays and the conditions studied in Gunnsteinsson and Steingrimsdottir (2019) in that it can occur throughout childhood, allowing us to test for heterogeneous treatment effects by age at onset. We find that mothers of children who were six years old or younger at onset have significantly larger income reductions than mothers of children who were older at onset, suggesting that the timing of onset matters.====Many would expect ex ante that the most severe childhood disabilities and chronic health conditions would significantly impact parental labor supply, so it is not surprising that Gunnsteinsson and Steingrimsdottir (2019) find significant impacts. However, it is less clear ex ante whether less severe disabilities and chronic health conditions also impact parental labor supply, and it is thus an important empirical question. The fact that we find economically meaningful impacts, especially surrounding the time of diagnosis, suggest that mothers of children with numerous other less severe chronic childhood health conditions (for example, asthma, juvenile arthritis, migraines, eating disorders and bowel illnesses) may also be impacted.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

Approximately 80 percent of sexually active people will contract HPV during their lives (Cleveland Clinic, 2018). HPV is a group of more than 200 related viruses (National Cancer Institute, 2020a), and HPV types 16 and 18 are responsible for 66 percent of all cervical cancers in the US (CDC, 2018). Over 40,000 people annually are diagnosed with an HPV-related cancer (Van Dyne et al., 2018). Approximately 11 million men are currently thought to have oral HPV (Deshmukh et al., 2017), and the incidence of male oral cancer exceeds the incidence of cervical cancer in women (Mourad et al., 2017).====Unlike most cancers, there is a highly effective vaccine that provides near complete protection against some of the most dangerous strains of HPV (Villa et al., 2005; Villa et al., 2006). Yet in 2018, only 68 percent of teens had initiated HPV vaccination and only 55 percent were fully vaccinated.==== Over the last decade, more than 40 states have introduced legislation on HPV vaccination, many of which sought to leverage the success of other school-entry vaccine requirements by mandating HPV vaccination (Barraza et al., 2016). However, these mandates have proven politically difficult. For example, the New York state Parent Teachers Association announced opposition to a recent bill which would require middle school students to receive the HPV vaccine, despite re-expressing its support for other mandated vaccinations (Times Herald-Record, 2020). Only three states and the District of Columbia have successfully adopted HPV vaccine school requirements, and vaccination proponents argue that their broad opt-out provisions limit their efficacy (Reynolds, 2012).====In this paper, I provide the first causal evaluation of how Washington, DC's 2014 HPV vaccine school requirement affected vaccine coverage. I find that the requirement increased the probability that a teen was fully vaccinated against HPV by nearly 20 percentage points—a 71 percent increase over the 2013 vaccination rate. I use an event study specification to show that this increase was not driven by pre-existing trends in vaccination. The use of placebo permutation tests confirms that the increase is larger than would be expected by chance. I also show that the estimate is robust to employing a synthetic control design. Back-of-the-envelope calculations imply that this requirement will directly result in 7 fewer cases of cervical cancer and 41 fewer cases of oropharyngeal cancer for the 33,000 students enrolled in Washington, DC schools during the 2017/2018 academic year. After accounting for the initial costs of cervical and oropharyngeal cancer care, as well as the statistical value of the life years lost, my estimates imply nearly $36 million dollars in reduced cancer savings compared to the $1.5 million it cost to vaccinate these students.====While important for policymakers, generalizing these estimates to the broader US requires caution. For one, the HPV vaccine initiation rate in the US in 2018 was higher than Washington, DC's initiation rate immediately prior to the policy change (68 percent vs. 62 percent). Moreover, vaccine initiation rates between girls and boys have converged. In 2018, 70 percent of girls and 67 percent of boys had received at least one shot of the HPV vaccine. As a result, school requirements may no longer induce larger increases in take-up for teen boys than teen girls. Yet even subject to these caveats, considering how these estimates could generalize is a useful exercise. There are 30 million 6–12th grade students in the US (National Center for Education Statistics, 2018). Applying my most conservative estimated increase in vaccine initiation (10.9 percentage points) still yields approximately 3.27 million more vaccinated students and over 6000 fewer cases of cervical cancer.====In addition to learning about ways to improve HPV vaccination, the Washington, DC policy change offers broader insights into the importance of how vaccine mandates are implemented. While respondents view vaccine school requirements more favorably if they contain opt-out provisions, these provisions likely reduce the mandates’ efficacy (Calo et al., 2016). Indeed, there is a positive association between the ease of opting-out of vaccination and the number of exemptions granted in a state (Blank et al., 2013) and repealing non-medical vaccine exemptions is associated with greater vaccine coverage (Nyathi et al., 2019; Richmine, Dor, and Moghtaderi, 2019). Beginning in 2009, sixth grade girls in DC were required to (i) receive the HPV vaccine or (ii) submit a one-time opt-out form. In 2014, the requirement was expanded to 6th grade boys and all students up through 12th grade. Additionally, all those not vaccinated were required to opt-out annually. As such, the treatment for teen girls was not a movement from “no requirement” to an “HPV vaccine requirement,” but rather a change from a one-time opt-out in 6th grade to an annual opt-out requirement all the way through 12th grade.====For teen girls, I find a 11-percentage point increase in HPV vaccine initiation and a 20-percentage point increase in vaccine completion. This pattern suggests that the annual reminder induced girls who had previously opted-out of HPV vaccination to receive their first shot, while also encouraging girls who had initiated vaccination to complete the vaccine series. In support of this pathway, I show that DC's 2014 HPV vaccine requirement reduced the probability that a teen girl had initiated but not completed the HPV vaccine. Additionally, I find that the 2014 requirement increased the probability that teen girls completed HPV vaccination within the recommended timeframe conditional on initiation. In contrast to these results for teen girls, I find that the increase in vaccine completion for teen boys is fully explained by an increase in vaccine initiation.====In Section 2, I discuss the history of the HPV vaccine, state HPV vaccine school requirements, and the existing literature on policies promoting HPV vaccination. In Section 3, I provide an overview of the NIS-Teen data and show descriptively that DC experienced a dramatic increase in HPV vaccination in the post-school requirement period. I then discuss my identification strategies, as well as the difficulties of conducting statistical inference with a single treated unit. In Section 4, I show that DC's 2014 HPV vaccine school requirement led to a large statistically significant increase in HPV vaccination, and I explore how the relationship varied by sex, grade level, race/ethnicity, and mother's educational attainment. In Section 5, I use my estimates to project the number of cancers prevented due to the 2014 mandate, and I estimate the cost savings associated with these reductions. Finally, I conclude in Section 6 by discussing the policy implications of my estimates and areas for future research.","How important is the structure of school vaccine requirement opt-out provisions?

Understanding the barriers to the adoption of these products and behaviors is critical for the design of cost-effective interventions. This paper studies how a program that provides financial incentives for conducting systematic health checks can affect the propensity to screen for gender and non-gender specific conditions among individuals who are not eligible for the program. For this purpose, I use data from the evaluation sample and the nationwide rollout of ==== (later renamed ==== and more recently ====), a Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) program that targets poor households in rural Mexico.====Compliance with health screening services is one of the requirements that the beneficiaries of CCT programs must satisfy in order to receive the transfer.==== Started in 1997, ==== is the ideal context in which to study the presence of spillover effects in the demand for medical screening among individuals who are not eligible for the transfer. The evaluation of the program is based on a village-level randomized design. From a group of 506 villages, 320 were randomly assigned to be in the treatment group for the ==== program starting in May 1998, and 186 were assigned to a control group for the program phase starting in November 1999. Data are available for all households in every village, both poor and non-poor, although only poor households are ==== for the transfer.==== Only the adult members of eligible households must undergo full preventive screenings: while both male and female household members have their blood pressure and blood-sugar levels tested, women also must be screened for cervical cancer.====Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women with an estimated 570,000 new cases in 2018 representing 6.6% of all female cancers. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 90% of deaths from cervical cancer occurred in low- and middle-income countries. In contrast to other types of cancer, cervical cancer has very well-defined risk factors, mostly related to sexual activity, and early detection through the use of a safe and inexpensive test–the Papanicolaou (PAP) smear test–has led to a huge drop in cervical cancer mortality in developed countries.==== However, this is not the case in developing countries, of which Mexico is one of the most striking examples. For many years, the country has displayed one of the highest cervical-cancer mortality rates in the world (World Health Organization 2008). Despite a longstanding national cervical-cancer screening program, lack of compliance with testing is high, especially in rural areas (Lazcano-Ponce et al., 1997; Watkins et al., 2002).====There is limited evidence on the existence and magnitude of spillover effects across individuals in active health-seeking behavior.==== From a social perspective, the cost effectiveness of a medical screening program might change substantially in the presence of externalities (Christakis 2004).==== In the first part of this paper, I study the effect of ==== on the propensity to use gender- and non-gender-specific screening tests among ineligible households. I show that the indirect treatment effect (ITE) of ==== on the propensity to screen for cervical cancer is positive, non-trivial and significantly different from zero. The basic results in this paper imply that during the rollout in rural areas on average every year about 195,000 women from ineligible households are screened for cervical cancer due to the ====’s externalities. I do not find any significant indirect effect on the probability of screening for diabetes and high blood pressure (hypertension).====Many mechanisms can potentially explain the indirect effect of ==== on the propensity to screen for a gender-specific condition. Qualitative evidence on Mexico, collected during the evaluation of ==== (Adato et al., 2000) and by various epidemiological studies (Lazcano-Ponce et al., 1997; Watkins et al., 2002), shows that one of the reasons that women do not attend PAP-smear testing is the actual or perceived opposition in the household to male doctors checking wives. As more women have to screen in order to comply with the program’s conditionality, the social sanction associated with screening compliance might shrink, both for eligible and ineligible women. Alternatively, consistent with the evidence for eligible households (Angelucci and Garlick, 2016; Attanasio, Lechene, 2002, Attanasio and Lechene, 2014), the increased propensity to screen for cervical cancer might be driven by greater intra-household decision-making power of women in ineligible households. Ineligible households might also be better informed about the benefits of screening, possibly as a result of interactions with eligible households. Another hypothesis is that, as a result of the documented income and consumption externalities of ==== (Angelucci and De Giorgi, 2009; Angelucci et al., 2018), ineligible households increase their demand of healthcare. Finally, the increased propensity to screen might simply reflect improvements in the supply of health services.====The data from the ==== evaluation sample do not allow isolating the importance of social norms without introducing additional assumptions. In a model of social-norm diffusion, the individual utility of screening depends on the action of other individuals, and the utility cost associated with social-norm violation differs for women. As the fraction of women who attend screening increases, the social sanction associated with screening compliance shrinks. A social-norm-based explanation has four main empirical predictions: 1) For socially regulated screening tests, the effect of ==== on both ineligible and eligible households should vary with the fraction of poor households in the locality; 2) There should be no significant interaction between the effect of ==== and the fraction of poor households for non-gender-specific screening tests, such as high blood pressure and diabetes; 3) For gender-specific tests, the intensity of the effect of ==== with respect to the fraction of poor households should be stronger among women on whom the social norm could potentially have a greater effect; 4) A longer exposure to ==== will lead to an increase in gender-specific screening rates, but not non-gender-specific screening rates.====I exploit the features of the ==== evaluation sample and the variation in female emancipation between male-headed and female-headed (widowed or with a husband who migrated) households to test predictions 1) through 3) of the social-norm explanation. Using the information available in the 2007 survey, I test prediction 4) comparing the screening behavior of women from the original evaluation communities that started receiving the program in 1998 with those from the communities that received it from 2000 onward. The evidence is, by and large, consistent with the predictions of the model of social-norm diffusion. However, I can not rule out that changes in intra-household decision-making and information sharing can explain my results. Other empirical tests provide no support for the hypotheses that the indirect effect of ==== on cervical-cancer screening is due to changes in the health services supply, income spillovers from eligible to ineligible households, and consumption externalities.====This paper contributes to different strands of the literature. A recent body of work studies indirect and general equilibrium effects of welfare programs (Cunha et al., 2019; Egger et al., 2019). In the ==== context, Angelucci and De Giorgi (2009) and Angelucci et al. (2018) provide evidence that the program changed the consumption and investment decisions of ineligible households.==== This paper provides evidence that ==== also affects the behavior of ineligible households through non-market mechanisms.====Another strand of literature studies the mechanisms through which peers affect ==== consumption. Among others, Cai et al. (2009) exploits a randomized natural field experiment to study the presence of observational learning on menu items in restaurants. Using box-office data, Moretti (2011) provides empirical evidence of the effect of social learning on movie choice. The findings by Oster and Thornton (2012) show that social learning plays an important role in the propensity to adopt menstrual cups in Nepal. This study provides evidence consistent with the hypothesis that social pressure can affect the decision to consume a particular type of experience good, i.e. preventive screening, in a developing country context.====The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 I provide background information on female-specific conditions in Mexico, and I describe the ==== program. Section 3 presents the data and discusses the empirical methodology. The direct and indirect effects of ==== on preventive screening are presented in Section 4. Section 5 provides suggestive evidence on some of the potential mechanisms that might explain the indirect effect of the program on the take-up of cervical-cancer screening.

Furthermore, we find that young individuals, an arguably healthy age group, exhibit economically meaningful responses to air pollution with an effect ranging between 0.45 and 1.04. Our results imply a large role of ==== driving heterogeneous marginal health effects. Total daily costs of a one standard deviation increase in ==== represent 0.5% of the total daily health expenditure, and 85% of this additional spending comes from more ==== hospitalized, while the remaining 15% can be attributable to more costly, and likely more complex, hospitalizations.","Air pollution contributes to serious illness, premature death and productivity loss, especially in urban areas (Graff Zivin, Neidell, 2012, He, Gouveia, Salvo, 2018, Isen, Rossin-Slater, Walker, 2017, Schlenker, Walker, 2015, Simeonova, Currie, Nilsson, R, 2019, among others). Most of the evidence on the health effects of air pollution concerns particulate matter (PM), ozone (O====) and nitrogen dioxide (NO====). PM consists of pollution particles of different sizes and compositions emitted into the atmosphere from both natural and anthropogenic sources, though most particle pollution comes from fuel combustion of motor vehicles and heating (EEA, 2016).====Due to its large diffusion and ability to penetrate the lungs and blood stream, PM is considered the leading environmental health risk factor (Chay, Dobkin, Greenstone, 2003, WHO, 2013). PM levels are particularly high in urban areas, where the massive use of private cars represents an important factor to consider in environmental policy making (Dominici, Greenstone, Sunstein, 2014, EC, 2019).====While the health effects of air pollution are well documented, we know very little about how concentration-response functions vary across different groups and socio-economic status (SES). Exposure to air pollution translates into costs through individual-specific damage functions. According to Hsiang et al. (2019), damage functions are closely related to SES, raising concerns about environmental justice (Banzhaf, Ma, Timmins, 2019, Lavaine, 2015, Neidell, 2004). Socio-economic factors interact with vulnerabilities through two major channels: heterogeneous sensitivity (i.e. baseline health) and heterogeneous compensatory behavior (i.e. avoidance and defensive investments) (Deschenes, Greenstone, Shapiro, 2017, Moretti, Neidell, 2011). Therefore, to properly quantify the welfare costs of air pollution, it is necessary to account for both baseline health and individual actions taken to avoid pollution exposure.====Estimating the causal effect of PM on health is complicated by widely-documented methodological issues, including omitted variable bias and measurement error. Several quasi-experimental studies have tried to overcome these challenges by introducing plausibly exogenous sources of variation in pollution. In particular, an influential body of literature has investigated the effect of air pollution on healthcare utilization, focusing on NO==== CO and PM (Deryugina, Heutel, Miller, Molitor, Reif, 2019, Halliday, Lynham, de Paula, 2015, Schlenker, Walker, 2015, among others). These studies find that air pollution has a strong adverse effect on hospitalizations and mortality for young children and the elderly, and quantify the costs of air pollution. While the literature has benefited immensely from their findings, each of these studies addresses a single subpopulation or geographical area. Moreover, most studies take place in settings featuring frictions in accessing to healthcare and differential costs of treatment, where selection issues can bias the estimates of the cost of pollution.====In this paper we estimate the heterogeneous health effects of PM on urgent respiratory hospitalizations and associated costs in Italy. We exploit public transportation (PT) strikes as an instrumental variable (IV) for endogenous air pollution, which also allows us to derive marginal health costs net of avoidance behavior costs for certain population subgroups. PT strikes in Italy are frequent and affect a very large portion of population. Being a recurrent practice, PT strikes are regulated by the Italian law, which guarantees that the essential minimum of transport services is maintained on strike days. This setting creates plausibly-exogenous shocks in air pollution concentration due to unexpected traffic congestion, but at the same time it does not prevent individuals from engaging in their daily routines. We use administrative hospitalization data for all major Italian municipalities between 2013 and 2015 and state-of-the-science data on PM==== concentrations to analyze the impact of particle pollution on the number and the complexity of hospitalizations across various socio-economically relevant population groups.====Our paper improves on previous work in several ways. First, we base our analysis on a conceptual framework where health-related costs of pollution vary across population subgroups due to group specific biological and avoidance costs. For any given level of biological sensitivity and PM exposure, there exists an optimal level of compensatory behavior that individuals adopt in order to maximize their health. The existing literature finds negative effects of pollution on health for infants and for the elderly, measuring biological effects net of compensatory behavior (see among others Chay, Dobkin, Greenstone, 2003, Deryugina, Heutel, Miller, Molitor, Reif, 2019, Schlenker, Walker, 2015). Nevertheless, these estimates represent a lower bound of the true effect of pollution on health as compensatory behavior is costly. The margin that we estimate exploits the fact that PT strikes impose a heavy congestion burden during rush hours on work and school days, but they guarantee a minimum provision of transport services. As such, they minimize the scope of students and workers to engage in compensatory behavior, which allows us to disentangle the different roles of heterogeneous sensitivity versus heterogeneous compensatory behavior for these groups.====Secondly, we analyze the costs of exposure to air pollution examining the heterogeneity across educational attainment, migration status, and age. For this purpose, we consider the universe of hospitalizations rather than a subset of patients from a particular insurance plan or geographical area. In doing so, we are able to mitigate two important sources of selection issues that are frequently neglected in the existing literature. First, we can exclude any frictions in access to care since the Italian healthcare is publicly provided, including free of charge secondary care provision. In addition, the cost of health treatments is largely homogeneous across individuals, so it is unlikely that differentials in the expected cost of care in various settings are generating sample selection.====Our third contribution addresses a new margin of health estimates. The existing literature has focused on differentials in the number of hospitalizations provided in response to pollution (extensive margin). However an increase in healthcare utilization might result not only because more patients obtain services, but also because the same number of patients obtain more costly services (intensive margin). We complement the existing evidence by estimating the intensive margin effects of PM exposure by looking at the average complexity of admissions.====We find that particle pollution instrumented by PT strikes causes an increase in urgent respiratory hospitalizations: a one standard deviation (s.d.) increase in PM==== (corresponding to nearly 11 ====) causes additional 0.79 hospitalizations per 100,000 residents. Importantly, we find that moderately young populations (aged 15–44) exhibit economically meaningful responses to changes in air pollution, with one s.d. increase in PM==== causing 0.45 to 1.04 additional hospitalizations each 100,000 young residents. These impacts imply a large role for differential avoidance behavior driving heterogeneous marginal effects. We document a higher prevalence of pollution-induced hospitalizations also among low educated individuals and migrants coming from low income countries.====Moreover, we find that one additional s.d. in average PM==== concentration increases the average unit cost of urgent respiratory hospitalizations by 17.6%, suggesting that higher pollution levels lead to hospitalizations which are not only more frequent but also on average more complex. Considering both the extensive and the intensive margin, we estimate that a daily increase of a one s.d. increase in PM==== is associated with additional 2686 euros of medical spending per 100,000 individuals, representing a 46% increase in the average daily expenditure for respiratory hospitalizations. For the young, the spending increase is 4986 euros per 100,000 individuals, while for the elderly it is 9052 euros. While the estimates are likely to be downward biased for the elderly due to residual unobserved avoidance behavior, for the young they approximate the true health cost of pollution exposure. We summarize the heterogeneity of these effects with a heat map showing how municipalities with different age structures and different PM exposures can face similar health costs.====Based on these results, we present back-of-the-envelope calculations of the total daily monetary costs of a one s.d. increase in PM==== for the 17.8 million residents in the 111 municipalities we consider, which amounts to about 477,500 euros: 85% of this spending increase comes from the extensive margin (more patients hospitalized), while the remaining 15% is likely to be attributable to the intensive margin (more costly hospitalizations). Overall, the total daily costs of a one s.d. increase in PM==== represent approximately 0.5% of the total daily health expenditure in Italy.====Our results on health costs of PM==== for the 15–44 age group have important policy implications. While we do not explicitly estimate the distinct roles of heterogeneity in sensitivity and heterogeneity in compensatory behavior, for this age group we are likely to infer their relative roles. The young, arguably the most healthy individuals are likely to optimally respond to their low marginal health sensitivity and high avoidance costs, choosing low levels of defensive behavior. Our estimates are thus likely to uncover the true biological cost and imply an important role for economic incentives determining defensive behavior, which may ultimately lower the exposure that individuals face. Additionally, our findings concerning the extensive and the intensive margins unveil incremental complexity of hospitalizations, hence additional costs, in response to air pollution.",When particulate matter strikes cities: Social disparities and health costs of air pollution,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629621000631,5 June 2021,2021,Research Article,142.0

The effects of such a momentous influx of new patients onto this uniquely important market have been the subject of relentless political and academic debate. Although considerable attention has been devoted to the insurance gains begotten by the Medicaid expansion component of the ACA, the establishment of private market insurance subsidies has accounted for no less than 40% of the overall coverage gains resulting from the law’s implementation (Frean et al., 2017). However, markedly less focus has been placed upon how these gains may have impacted utilization behaviors and the prices faced by patients, both new and old, as well as the financial health of hospitals. In this paper, we chip away at these questions by studying how the dual insurance expansions have affected the provision of hospital-based care along the price and quantity dimensions. In light of the many changes occurring as a result of the law, we also investigate potential spillovers to the quality of care received by the patient population that was already insured pre-ACA. A better understanding of how this surge in newly insured patients affects the hospital industry is critical for gauging the impact of the new law as hospitals account for approximately 47% of health care services consumed.====Many papers studying the effects of the ACA often focus on the impact in a particular state (e.g., Duggan et al. (2019b) examining Calfornia, or (Baicker, Finkelstein, 2011, Finkelstein, Taubman, Wright, Bernstein, Gruber, Newhouse, Allen, Baicker, 2012, Taubman, Allen, Wright, Baicker, Finkelstein, 2014), who study the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment) or rely on state-level variation in Medicaid expansion decisions (Courtemanche, Marton, Yelowitz, 2016, Kaestner, Garrett, Chen, Gangopadhyaya, Fleming, 2017, Pines, Zocchi, Moghtaderi, Black, Farmer, Hufstetler, Klauer, Pilgrim, 2016). In contrast, our paper focuses measurement on hospitals across the entire U.S. and identifies the impact of the law by exploiting county-level variation in the degree to which the population is exposed to the Medicaid expansion and to private, non-group premium subsidies.==== To gain an even more precise measure of the reform’s impact on individual hospitals, we combine these exposure variables with patient flow data to estimate the fraction of a ==== patient population that gains insurance through the ACA reforms. Using these precisely targeted measures, we examine the effects of the insurance expansions on utilization, the financing of care, and the potential for spillovers in the quality of care received by the already insured population. Our paper adds to the substantial yet growing literature on the effects of health insurance expansions on hospital utilization, and on how such care is financed (Anderson, Glasheen, Anoff, Pierce, Lane, Jones, 2016, Blavin, 2016, DeLeire, Joynt, McDonald, 2014, Kaufman, Reiter, Pink, Holmes, 2016, Manning, Newhouse, Duan, Keeler, Leibowitz, 1987, Miller, 2012, Miller, 2012, Nikpay, Buchmueller, Levy, 2016, Rudowitz, Garfield, 2015). We also contribute to the more recent literature examining potential spillover effects of insurance expansions on the outcomes of patient populations that are not directly affected by the ACA (Carey, Miller, Wherry, 2020, Glied, Hong, 2018, McInerney, Mellor, Sabik, 2017).====We find that the ACA insurance expansions, which lowered the cost of care for millions of newly insured individuals, led to a modest increase in outpatient hospital visits following the passage of the new law. The effect on utilization is consistent with a large body of literature on the effects of insurance expansions, including evidence from the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment (Baicker, Finkelstein, 2011, Finkelstein, Taubman, Wright, Bernstein, Gruber, Newhouse, Allen, Baicker, 2012, Taubman, Allen, Wright, Baicker, Finkelstein, 2014) and prior ACA evidence (Duggan, Gupta, Jackson, 2019, Pines, Zocchi, Moghtaderi, Black, Farmer, Hufstetler, Klauer, Pilgrim, 2016). The outpatient utilization effects are also consistent with Garthwaite et al. (2019), who examine hospital claims level data from 20 states and show that even the most recent round of Medicaid expansions generated heterogeneous utilization effects across states, varying positively with the size of the group gaining coverage and negatively with the pre-expansion level of uncompensated care costs.==== Unlike Garthwaite et al. (2019), however, we do not find convincing evidence that the recent round of insurance expansions increased the use of inpatient care.====The effects on emergency department care are ambiguous. While the cost of emergency care falls for newly insured individuals, the use of primary care services could potentially offset this effect. We find no evidence of a change in emergency department visits, which is consistent with the Oregon Health Insurance (Baicker, Finkelstein, 2011, Finkelstein, Taubman, Wright, Bernstein, Gruber, Newhouse, Allen, Baicker, 2012, Taubman, Allen, Wright, Baicker, Finkelstein, 2014) and prior ACA evidence (Pines et al., 2016). Our results contrast with Miller, 2012, Miller, 2012, who find that insurance provision decreased the incidence of emergency department visits without sacrificing health outcomes, an apparent efficiency gain. Our results also differ from that of Duggan et al. (2019b), who find evidence of increases in emergency department visits caused by the Medicaid insurance expansion in California.====One potential reason for the divergence of our results with that of Duggan et al. (2019b) is that unlike in our paper, they use individual claims data, which allows them to observe outcomes specifically for the 21to64 year-old age group targeted by the reforms. By contrast, our hospital-level results necessarily include outcomes for unaffected groups, and so our estimated effects are a percent increase relative to a larger base. The magnitudes of our percent change estimates accordingly fall below those of Duggan et al. (2019b).====While we estimate that the effects on total hospital utilization are modest, we find that the law’s primary impact was to produce both a shift in how hospital care has been financed–from uncompensated care to Medicaid and private payers–and an increase in prices and profits as reimbursement rates have become relatively more lucrative. The positive effects on prices, revenues, and profits are primarily driven by the Medicaid expansion, which matches the results from Duggan et al. (2019b) in the case of California. The concordance of our results with Duggan et al. (2019b) related to the pricing and financing of hospital services suggests the effects they find in California may be more generalizable to the effects of the ACA more broadly. In fact, we find nearly identical results, even after excluding California from our sample. Our results also corroborate and complement earlier evidence of the ACA effects on hospital finances (Blavin, 2016, Freedman, Nikpay, Carroll, Simon, 2017, Pines, Zocchi, Moghtaderi, Black, Farmer, Hufstetler, Klauer, Pilgrim, 2016).====In addition to altering patterns of utilization and hospital financing, the changes created by the ACA insurance expansions have raised concerns of potential spillover effects that could impact the quality of care for the population already insured prior to the ACA. As discussed in Carey et al. (2020), the potential negative spillover effects could arise if the expansion overburdened the health care system and affected outcomes for those already insured. Carey et al. (2020) examine the potential negative spillovers on utilization for the Medicare population and find no effects on primary care services. On the other hand, McInerney et al. (2017) find evidence of spillover effects from Medicaid expansions in the 2000s that reduced spending within the Medicare population but find no effects on the quality of care. Glied and Hong (2018) also find that prior insurance expansions generate negative spillover effects on the utilization for the Medicare population. Although not directly concerned with spillover effects, Kolstad and Kowalski (2012) find that the Massachusetts Health Reform insurance expansion reduced the length of hospital inpatient stays.====While this literature focuses on negative spillovers, it is also possible for positive spillovers to arise from the ACA, as hospitals may improve quality to compete for a newly-insured and more profitable patient population. We examine potential spillover effects on hospital services by primarily focusing on the already insured Medicare population. We find that the influx of newly-insured patients has no effect on Medicare inpatient utilization and no effect on a diverse set of quality indicators including measures of mortality and readmissions for the Medicare patient population. We also find no effects on quality for the full patient population based on patient surveys and process of care measures (i.e., does hospital follow standard medical care protocols?). Thus, this paper contributes to the spillover literature by showing that the public and private insurance expansions have no effect on the quality of care for those already insured, as is consistent with McInerney et al. (2017).====It should be emphasized that these quality measures do not capture changes in the health of the newly-insured population, but only changes in the quality of the treatment provided. Indeed, recent research by Sommers et al. (2012), Sommers (2017) and Goldin et al. (2021), Miller et al. detect significant decreases in mortality for the Medicaid population following state Medicaid expansions.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. The next section briefly summarizes the reforms. Section 3 describes the data sources from which the study sample is extracted, Section 4 lays out the identification assumptions and strategy, and Section 5 details how the insurance expansions affected healthcare utilization, prices, and finances. Section 6 ties together the study’s findings by directly linking federal dollars provided for insurance expansions with hospital revenues, and then decomposing them into utilization and price effects. Finally, Section 7 provides some closing remarks and illuminates promising avenues for future research on these and related topics.",Insurance expansions and hospital utilization: Relabeling and reabling?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629621000679,5 June 2021,2021,Research Article,143.0

Agrawal et al. (2018) predict that reductions in the cost of prediction due to the increasing adoption of machine learning models will revolutionize how businesses address the problems they face. The excitement about new AI methods is, in part, due to the belief that they provide better predictive accuracy than traditional econometric methods.====However, evaluating health policy questions often involves contemplating a substantial shift in the choice environment. For example, a health insurance reform may change the set of insurance products that consumers can buy and provider entry and exit alters the set of products available to patients. For such questions, it is less obvious whether purely data-driven machine learning methods can usefully be applied, compared to models that incorporate domain knowledge through economic assumptions. As Athey (2017) remarks:====In this paper, we use a major change in the choice environment to compare the performance of an econometric hospital demand model to machine learning models. Hospital demand models are widely used for evaluating counterfactual changes in choice sets in hospital mergers (Capps, Dranove, Satterthwaite, 2003, Farrell, Balan, Brand, Wendling, 2011, Gaynor, Ho, Town, 2015, Gowrisankaran, Nevo, Town, 2015), insurance mergers (Ho and Lee, 2019), and narrow insurance networks (Ghili, 2016, Ho, Lee, 2019). To gauge the different models’ performance, we use a set of natural disasters that closed one or more hospitals but left the majority of the surrounding area relatively undisturbed. These “shocks” exogenously altered consumers’ choice sets, creating a benchmark – patients’ actual choices in the post-disaster period – against which to assess the performance of different predictive models calibrated on pre-disaster data. Our main prediction criterion is the fraction of actual choices that we correctly predict using the highest estimated probability as the predicted choice. By comparing the different models’ predictions to actual post-disaster choices, we are able to gauge predictive performance when the choice environment has changed.====Relative to a benchmark econometric choice model akin to those used in recent academic work (Gowrisankaran, Nevo, Town, 2015, Ho, 2006), we consider the performance of ML models that are heavily used by practitioners (Athey and Imbens, 2019) and that are currently implemented in standard software packages. In particular, we compare examples of two classes of machine learning algorithms – grouping and regularization. Grouping models partition the space of patients into types and estimate choice probabilities separately for each type. In this category, we evaluate an “exogenous” grouping model based upon Raval et al. (2017), an individual decision tree model, and two methods, random forests and gradient boosted trees, that are known to improve prediction performance by aggregating over multiple trees. Regularization models involve building a “punishment” term into the objective function that leads to the exclusion of variables that add relatively little new information. In this category, we focus attention on a regularized version of a multinomial logit model that selects the variables most relevant for predicting hospital choices.====We find that the gradient boosting and random forest methods estimated on pre-disaster data generally outperform all other approaches at predicting patient choice after a disaster has closed a hospital. Averaging across all six experiments, the random forest, gradient boosting, and regularization models all correctly predict 46% of choices. By contrast, the benchmark econometric model correctly predicts 40% of choices, while assigning all choices to the highest share hospital in the destroyed hospital’s service area correctly predicts 29% of choices. Either the random forest or gradient boosting model is the best predicting model for all of the experiments, and they are the best two models for four of the six experiments.====While it would be hard to objectively distinguish between the performance of the random forest and gradient boosting models, we do find a large difference between these best predicting models in terms of computational time. For our largest dataset, the random forest takes minutes to run while the gradient boosting model takes several hours. The next best model, the regularized logit, takes almost a week for the same dataset.====We further show that the better performance of machine learning models is not driven by post-disaster changes in patient composition or preferences. Across disasters, the number of admissions falls by 6 to 14% after the hospital is destroyed, which indicates that some patients may either delay or decline treatment. However, we find that the different models perform qualitatively similarly after removing areas that faced more destruction from the disaster and when restricting our sample to cardiac or pregnancy patients who likely have a much more limited ability to delay treatment. We also find similar results for patients with different levels of disease acuity and who have different payers, which further suggests that our results are robust across different patient populations.====In most situations, an analyst will not have an experiment to use to evaluate model performance. Instead, they will only be able to gauge accuracy by “holding out” a portion of their data, and testing how well different models estimated on the remainder of the data do in predicting outcomes in the hold out sample. We find that predictive accuracy in a validation sample formed by holding out 20% of the training data provides a good guide for which models do best at predicting choices after the disasters.====While we consistently find that the machine learning methods perform best at prediction on average, their relative performance deteriorates for patients who were more likely to have had a major change in their choice set. We show this by considering patients who were especially likely to have gone to the destroyed hospital, either because they previously went there or because we predict a high probability of them going there. On average, the relative performance of the machine learning methods over the benchmark logit falls for patients who were more likely to have used the destroyed hospital. For the experiment where the destroyed hospital had a 50% share of the market pre-disaster, all of the machine learning models perform ==== than our benchmark conditional logit for patients predicted to have a 50% or greater probability of going to the destroyed hospital.====The machine learning models could perform relatively worse with a larger change in the choice set for two main reasons. First, a less local, simpler model with less variable estimates may be required. We test this explanation by varying the minimum node size of the random forest; with a larger minimum node size, the random forest model is less local. However, we find that random forest models that are less local, and use more patients to estimate each set of probabilities, perform (weakly) worse with a larger change in the choice set.====Second, there may be a greater need to complement the data with the researcher’s prior domain knowledge on model specification. In our setting, domain knowledge is reflected by specifying the logit model’s parametric form. The econometric model we estimate imposes the parametric restriction that any horizontal, spatial differentiation enters through consumers’ travel time to hospitals, as in the canonical model of Hotelling (1929).==== We quantify the role this domain knowledge may play through an optimal model combination exercise that allocates weights to different models. We find that the weight on the conditional logit model rises as we move from using out of sample validation data for which patients see no change in choice set, to the test sample of post-disaster patients, to subsets of test sample patients with a high probability of visiting the destroyed hospital.====Overall, our work connects to the literature on hospital competition and how to infer providers’ substitutability (Gaynor, Ho, Town, 2015, Gaynor, Kleiner, Vogt, 2013). Within this literature, it is most closely related to Raval et al. (2020), which shows that econometric demand models may often underpredict the aggregate levels of patient substitution (i.e., “diversion ratios”) to hospitals with the highest observed substitution following natural disasters. While that paper studies predictions about diversion ratios among a set of econometric models, this paper studies predictions about individual choices and compares machine learning models to econometric models.====Outside of the health literature, our work contributes to the emerging literature in economics and quantitative social science on the application of machine learning techniques. Within this literature, our work is closest to Bajari, Nekipelov, Ryan, Yang, 2015, Bajari, Nekipelov, Ryan, Yang, 2015 and Rose (2016), which focus on evaluating the relative performance of machine learning models given a stable choice environment. These papers consider the out-of-sample performance of machine learning models relative to econometric models of consumer goods demand and health care expenditures, respectively. In contrast, our work studies out-of-sample performance when there are plausibly exogenous changes in the choice environment.====By illustrating how standard machine learning approaches perform in making predictions following a change in the choice environment, our paper also contributes to the growing body of work focused on the proper application of machine learning methods to make causal predictions (Athey, 2017). In contrast to the literature on estimating treatment effects using machine learning (e.g., Belloni, Chernozhukov, Hansen, 2014, Wager, Athey, 2018), we do not use the variation from the policy change in our estimation. Rather, we estimate a model without using that variation and assess the quality of the model's predictions following a change in the environment. In estimating the model without using variation on the change in the environment, we more closely mimic the problem that is frequently faced by policy makers and businesses when making decisions. They need to make decisions where they only have access to information prior to the change occurring.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses our data and experimental settings. Then, in Section 3, we describe the different models we test. Section 4 examines the computational time required for the machine learning algorithms, Section 5 presents the results on model performance, and Section 6 examines how model performance deteriorates for patients experiencing a greater change in environment. Finally, we discuss lessons that practitioners may take from our work and conclude in Section 7.",How do machine learning algorithms perform in predicting hospital choices? evidence from changing environments,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629621000667,4 June 2021,2021,Research Article,144.0

Mask mandate introduction was staggered from mid-June to mid-August 2020 in the 34 ==== regions in Ontario, Canada’s largest province by population. Using this variation, we find that mask mandates are associated with a 22 percent weekly reduction in new COVID-19 cases, relative to the trend in absence of mandate. Province-level data provide corroborating evidence. We control for mobility behaviour using Google geo-location data and for lagged case totals and case growth as information variables. Our analysis of additional survey data shows that mask mandates led to an increase of about 27 percentage points in self-reported mask wearing in public. Counterfactual policy simulations suggest that adopting a nationwide mask mandate in June could have reduced the total number of diagnosed COVID-19 cases in Canada by over 50,000 over the period July–November 2020. Jointly, our results indicate that mandating mask wearing in indoor public places can be a powerful policy tool to slow the spread of COVID-19.","When government policies to stem the spread of COVID-19 were introduced in early 2020, the best available supporting evidence came from research on previous epidemics, epidemiological modeling and case studies ====). Even when the efficacy of a given intervention in reducing viral transmission has been established, doubts regarding its usefulness may persist, because of uncertainty about adherence to the rules and other behavioural responses. For example, even though there is significant agreement in the medical literature that respiratory transmission of COVID-19 is the dominant vector (====, ====, ====, ====), a mask mandate may not be effective in practice if it fails to increase the prevalence of mask wearing (compliance) or if it leads to increased contacts because of a false sense of security.====The low economic cost of mask mandates relative to other COVID-19 containment measures has generated keen interest worldwide for studying their effectiveness.==== This interest has been compounded by the substantial variation in official advice regarding mask use, especially early in the pandemic, with national health authorities and the World Health Organization giving inconsistent or contradictory recommendations over time, ranging from ‘not recommended’ to ‘mandatory’.==== ==== in the Appendix plots self-reported mask usage in select countries (Canada, USA, Germany and Australia) and across Canadian provinces. The figure shows large differences in mask usage, both across countries and within Canada.====An added challenge is to disentangle the impact of mask mandates from that of other policies, behavioural responses, or third factors (====, ====We estimate and quantify the impact of mask mandates and other non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), including regulations on businesses and gatherings, school closures, travel and self-isolation, and long-term care homes, on the growth of new COVID-19 cases in Canada. The Canadian data have the advantage of allowing two complementary approaches to address our objective. First, we estimate the effect of mandates by exploiting within-province variation in the timing of indoor face mask mandates in the 34 public health regions (Public Health Units==== or PHUs) in Ontario, Canada’s most populous province with roughly 40% (15 mln) of the country’s population (====). The advantage of this approach is that it uses variation over a relatively small geographic scale (PHU), holding all province-level policies and factors constant. The adoption of indoor face mask mandates in the 34 public health regions was staggered over approximately two months (June to August 2020), creating sufficient intertemporal variation.====Second, we evaluate the impact of NPIs in Canada as a whole, using the variation in the timing of mask mandates and other policies in the country’s ten provinces. We construct ==== for the intensity and timing of COVID-relevant policy measures from official public health orders and government announcements. By studying inter-provincial variation in the policy measures, we can analyze the impact of not only mask mandates, but also other NPIs, for which there is little or no variation across Ontario’s PHUs. In addition, our data include the initial “closing” period (March–April), the gradual “re-opening” period (May–August), and the Fall period of new restrictions, providing variation from both the imposition and the relaxation of policies.====Our panel-data estimation strategy broadly follows the approach of ====, which we modify and adapt to the Canadian context. We account for observed behavioural changes and trends (using Google Community Mobility Reports geo-location data as proxy), as well as for lagged outcome responses to policy and behavioural changes. Our empirical approach also allows past epidemiological outcomes to impact current outcomes, either as information variables affecting unmeasured behaviour and policy, and/or directly, as in the SIR epidemiological model (====).====We find that, after two weeks from implementation, mask mandates are associated, on average, with a reduction of nearly 25 log points in the weekly case growth rate in Ontario, which can be interpreted as a 22% weekly reduction in new diagnosed COVID-19 cases relative to the trend in absence of mask mandate. We find corroborating evidence in the province-level analysis: a 20% weekly reduction in cases relative to the no-mandate trend in our baseline empirical specification. Furthermore, using additional survey data (====), we show that mask mandates increased self-reported mask usage in Canada by about 27 percentage points on average after implementation, confirming that the mandates had a significant impact on masking behaviour. Jointly, our results suggest that mandating mask wearing in indoor public places can be a powerful policy tool to slow the spread of COVID-19.====Counterfactual policy simulations using our empirical estimates further suggest that mandating indoor masks Canada-wide in mid-June could have reduced new COVID-19 cases in the country by more than 50,000 cases in total over the period July–November 2020 relative to the actually observed numbers.====In addition, we find that the most stringent policy restrictions on businesses and gatherings observed in the provincial data are associated with a 44% weekly decrease of new cases, relative to the trend in absence of restrictions. The business/gathering estimates are, however, noisier than our estimates for mask mandates and do not retain statistical significance in all specifications. Travel and long-term care restrictions are associated with a sharp decrease in weekly case growth in the initial closing period (March–April). These results suggest that relaxed restrictions and the associated increase in business and ==== activity and gatherings (including retail, restaurants and bars) can offset, in whole or in part, the estimated impact of mask mandates on COVID-19 case growth. We also find statistically significantly negative association between current case growth and information (log of past weekly cases), which is consistent with a behavioural feedback effect, e.g., people changing their contact rate based on observed case totals.====Our paper relates most closely to ====, ==== and ====, which are recent studies on mask mandates using observational data, but adds to them in several ways.==== First, we use regional variation within the same jurisdiction (similar to Mitze et al., but with a larger sample of treated regions that obviates the need for synthetic controls). This mitigates concerns about omitted variables, e.g., provincial or other factors. Second, we additionally use variation over a different geographic and administrative level, across provinces (similar to Chernozhukov et al. and Lyu and Wehby for U.S. states), and obtain very similar results as in our main analysis. Third, we estimate the increase in self-reported mask usage following mask mandates, which can help in understanding and predicting how the effect of mask mandates on COVID-19 spread may differ in other contexts. Our finding that mask mandates led to a significant increase in mask usage corroborates the large estimated mask mandate effect on COVID-19 case growth. Fourth, an important difference between our paper and ====, possibly explaining our larger estimates for the effect of mask mandates, is that we evaluate ==== mandatory indoor mask wearing for the public, instead of mandatory mask wearing for ====. While other factors such as differences in mask-wear compliance between Canada and the U.S. may also contribute to the different estimates of the policy impact, our results suggest that broader in scope mask policies can be more effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19.====In the medical literature, ====, ====, ==== and ====, among others, argue that face masks can reduce the spread of COVID-19. Our paper also complements recent work on COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions in various countries, e.g., ====, ====, ==== and in Canada, ====, ====, ====, ====.==== We investigate whether the NPIs’ impact differed in the initial closing-down period of imposition of policy measures by restricting the sample to the period March 11, to May 14. The end date (referring to the NPIs in place on April 30) was chosen because very few NPIs were relaxed in Canada before early May (see ====). The results in ==== suggest that the imposition of closures, long-term care restrictions, and travel restrictions early in the pandemic was associated with a sharp subsequent reduction in weekly case growth, as also seen on ==== – the average log weekly growth rate of cases ====C) fell from 2.4 (ten-fold growth in weekly cases) to ==== (33% decrease in weekly cases) between March 15, and April 5. We interpret these results with caution, however, since many policy measures and restrictions were enacted in a short time interval during March 2020 and there is not much inter-provincial variation (see ====). No mask mandates were present in Canada in this period. We did not find any additional policy impacts in the mid-May to November period (not reported in the Table).==== We also examine the weekly deaths growth rate as an outcome variable. Because COVID-19 deaths in Canada are highly concentrated in long-term care homes, mask mandates and NPIs may have a different effect on deaths growth than on cases. ==== reports estimates of ==== using the weekly deaths growth rate ==== as the dependent variable, for each province ==== and date ==== in the sample period, where ==== are weekly deaths from date ====6 to date ====. We use a 28-day lag for the policy, behaviour, and information variables, to reflect the fact that deaths occur on average about two weeks after case detection (see Appendix E for detailed justification). The estimate coefficients on Mask_28 are not statistically significantly different from zero in our baseline specifications. However, considering the large standard errors, they are not inconsistent in magnitude with our estimates for mask mandates and case growth in ====. In addition, when weighing the data by provincial population in columns (7) and (8), which de-emphasizes the small provinces with very few deaths, the results in ==== suggest that mask mandates are associated with a 39 log points reduction in the weekly death rate (32% weekly reduction in deaths relative to the trend in absence of mandate). We supplement ==== with ====, where we display the estimated coefficients, with 95% confidence intervals, on the main variable of interest Mask_28 for different sample end dates between August 31, and November 30, 2020.","Face masks, public policies and slowing the spread of COVID-19: Evidence from Canada",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629621000606,3 June 2021,2021,Research Article,145.0

We used monthly data from the ,"This study aims to quantify the causal effect of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on health-related absenteeism rates among workers living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The analysis is based on data from South Africa, where HIV prevalence among the working population is currently around 19 percent (UNAIDS, 2019). Without treatment, HIV leads to a significant economic burden due to increasing health-related absenteeism and eventually death (Fox et al., 2004). ART is the only way to treat an HIV infection in the long run and it also potentially allows patients to maintain a productive work life. Understanding to what extent ART enables individuals living with HIV to perform in the labor market is crucial for both policymakers and private industry.====In the global fight against HIV, large-scale ART programs in lower-income countries have shown to significantly improve health outcomes of individuals living with HIV. Wools-Kaloustian et al. (2006) provide evidence for the clinical effectiveness of ART programs in a low resource setting in Kenya. ART increased patients’ CD4 cell counts from 100 cells/μl to 300 cells/μl within three years, indicating an improvement of a patient's immune system and health status.==== Bor et al. (2013) find a remarkable increase in adult life expectancy from 49.2 years in 2003 – one year prior to the public provision of ART in South Africa – to 60.5 years in 2011.====The effectiveness of ART in improving patients’ health in the long run may also imply potentially strong effects on labor outcomes. To determine such effects, data from past randomized controlled trials are typically not available and future randomized controlled trials of ART are indefensible, because the efficacy of ART has been clearly established for several decades. Non-randomized studies, however, are likely to suffer from endogenous treatment selection bias, because unobserved factors affecting the patient's and health worker's decision to initiate treatment can influence the outcome variable. A number of previous studies have estimated ART effects on labor outcomes (French et al., 2019; Habyarimana et al., 2010; Larson et al., 2013). Apart from the inclusion of fixed effects, which can only capture those unobserved confounding factors that are either constant over time or constant across all individuals, these studies have not fully addressed endogenous treatment selection. Larson et al. (2013) estimated the impact of ART on overall absenteeism, productivity, and labor income by using nearest-neighbor matching methods. They find that all outcomes deteriorated before and during treatment initiation, but quickly recovered within one year after treatment had started. After two years on ART, productivity remained eight percent below the reference group for male HIV-negative workers while the gap is even larger for women at 19 percent. The authors matched workers living with HIV and taking up treatment with workers from the general workforce. However, since treatment take-up was not randomized, nearest-neighbor matching of workers taking up treatment with the presumably HIV-negative general workforce does not fully address the problem of endogenous treatment selection.====Habyarimana et al. (2010) posed a research question close to that of our analysis. They also focused on the mining industry and used a dataset covering 440 treated individuals in Botswana between 2001 and 2006. The outcome variable in this study was health-related absenteeism days. The authors find that absenteeism significantly increased one year before treatment started. After treatment initiation, absenteeism declined sharply within the first year. The identification method in this study draws a precise picture of absenteeism around treatment initiation but also has some shortcomings. First, Habyarimana et al. (2010) used multiple lags of the explanatory variable in one regression. Since all lags depended on each other, it was not possible to estimate the isolated effect of different lags separately (Angrist and Pischke, 2008). Second, the authors did not estimate an overall treatment effect of ART on health-related absenteeism. Third, by only using individual fixed effects, endogenous treatment selection was not fully controlled for in the analysis.====French et al. (2019) used the same firm dataset that we have used in this work. Their outcome variables were worker turnover and health-related absenteeism. By restricting the data to workers who have taken up treatment and using a Cox proportional hazard model they find heterogeneous effects that depended on initiation timing. Initiating treatment with CD4 counts above 350 cells/μl was associated with an eight percent lower risk of being absent compared to initiating below 200 cells/μl. This method only allowed estimation of a relative treatment effect comparing early and late treatment initiation.====Our contributions to the literature are fourfold. First, we add to the existing evidence on labor effects of ART by using data on a large-scale ART program covering a relatively long period. Second, we address endogenous treatment selection using an instrumental variable (IV) approach. During our observation period, ART policies changed several times which we exploit in combination with individual CD4 counts in order to identify treatment take-up. We thus estimate for the first time the causal effect of ART on health-related absenteeism in an important population – South African miners – suffering from a major HIV epidemic.==== Third, we apply a heterogeneity analysis to identify gender- and skill-specific differences in the treatment effect. Fourth, we use sector- and skill-specific wage data for five sub-Saharan African countries to compare the costs of ART to the monetary value of ART effects on absenteeism. This last analysis allows us to measure the economic benefits of the treatment and to derive precise policy implications beyond the population of South-African miners.",HIV treatment and worker absenteeism: Quasi-experimental evidence from a large-scale health program in South Africa,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629621000643,2 June 2021,2021,Research Article,146.0

However, as feedback over forgone acts is missing, the regret aversion effect disappears. Finally, we show that information avoidance induced by regret aversion can significantly bias our evaluation to prefer those health programs that completely eliminate a risk, i.e., the certainty effect.","Limited resources force policy makers to set priorities among policies. To secure an efficient resource allocation cost-benefit analysis, in which the social benefits of a policy or an investment are compared to its costs, is often used. The use of cost-benefit analysis requires, however, that all benefits and costs are measured in a common metric, i.e., money. In evaluating public programs with the objective of reducing health risks, an estimate of the monetary value of health is thus required. These estimates can be obtained from either market data or some stated-preference studies such as contingent valuation (e.g., Andersson and Treich (2011)). Whatever methods are utilized for an estimate of the monetary value of health, most of this literature has made a crucial assumption that people are standard expected utility maximizers. However, this assumption is commonly rejected as found in many empirical studies (e.g., Camerer (1995); Starmer (2000)). Assuming expected utility in the face of such rejection may lead to biased risk valuations and, consequently, to biased policy recommendations. It is therefore useful to derive valuation formulas for changes in risks that take into account the fact that people deviate from expected utility.====One important reason for why people deviate from standard expected utility is that they not only value the outcome obtained from their decisions, but are also sensitive to whether their decisions were made correctly in hindsight. People experience regret (or rejoicing) when realizing or imagining that their current situation would have been better (or worse), if they had decided differently.==== Regret is not only an affective reaction to bad decision outcomes or processes but also a powerful force in motivating and giving direction to behavior. In the 1980s, Bell (Bell, 1982, Bell, 1983), and Loomes and Sugden (1982) formulated decision theories that take regret into account.==== In principle, regret theory can explain many of the deviations from expected utility theory (e.g., the common ratio effect, preference intransitivity).==== Empirical tests have also produced results in line with the theory (e.g., Loomes et al., 1991; Bleichrodt et al., 2010; Somasundaram and Diecidue, 2017). Regret theory has also real-world implications and can explain field data that are incompatible with expected utility theory. For example, Braun and Muermann (2004) applies it to insurance decisions, Gollier and Salanié (2006) to asset pricing, Michenaud and Solnik (2008) to currency hedging, Feliz-Ozbay and Ozbay (2007) to auctions, and more recently Gollier (2018) to longshot bias.====However, to our best knowledge, regret theory has not been formally introduced into the study of cost-benefit analysis. Especially, when facing decisions about ones’ health or lives such as whether working in a dangerous sector or not, people tend to be more likely to anticipate regret and act upon it. This is because these decisions are particularly important, difficult and generally not easy to undo (Zeelenberg, 1999). We therefore expect that regret should play a crucial role in affecting individuals’ health behaviors. Indeed, in a field study Wroe et al. (2004) compared different potential predictors of actual immunization decisions and found that anticipated regret was the strongest predictor of likelihood of immunizing children.==== Similarly, Boeri et al. (2013) and Brewer et al. (2016) found that anticipated regret could promote precautionary health behaviors. In this paper, we take the very first step to examine the willingness to pay under anticipated regret for reductions in health risks which is the key input for evaluating public health programs. The psychological insights drawn from our study can reshape economic principles in benefit and cost analysis of health policy.====To approach our research question, we introduce a model of prevention in which a decision maker faces ex-ante some uncertainty over her future health status and can invest into a costly risk-reduction tool to reduce her probability of having a health problem. Different from existing studies on this topic (e.g., Jones-Lee, 1974), uncertainty in our model is described by states of nature la Savage (1951) so that regret theory can be naturally applied. More explicitly, the set of states of nature is a Cartesian product of two variables, i.e., the occurrence of some hazard and the effectiveness of prevention, which jointly determine the decision maker’s final health status. Our prevention model is particularly well suited to diseases resulting from the combination of genetic disorders and health behaviors such as cancer. Moreover, we use state-dependent utility functions that take into account the fact that wealth utility is higher in the healthy state than in the sick state as well documented in the health economics literature (e.g., Viscusi, 2019). As our benchmark, to decide whether to take a preventive measure or not, a standard expected utility maximizer makes a trade-off between two important attributes: the safety and its cost. For small risk reductions, the willingness to pay under standard expected utility theory is simply the marginal rate of substitution between wealth and baseline risk in consumption utility. The regret-averse decision maker has however an additional objective of minimizing ex post regret. In particular, whatever act was taken, regret could always be felt depending on the realized state of nature. For instance, if the preventive measure was taken, the decision maker might regret for having wasted money (i.e., action regret) because it was either not needed or not effective. On the contrary, if the preventive measure was not taken, she might regret for having missed the opportunity of protecting herself from the health problem (i.e., inaction regret).====What makes preventive decisions different from other risk behaviors such as investing in the stock market is that uncertainty may or may not be fully resolved. Studies in cognitive psychology suggest that without expecting feedback over forgone alternatives (e.g., Zeelenberg et al., 1998) regret becomes less worrisome. The key question our study will address is how ex post information provision affects health behaviors through the channel of anticipated regret. We first consider situations involving full resolution of uncertainty. This is the case when the occurrence of harm and the effectiveness of prevention are known ex post. For example, an individual who decides whether or not to wear a helmet when cycling knows eventually whether an accident has occurred and whether the helmet was effective in preventing an injury. We show that disproportionate aversion to large regrets exaggerates willingness to pay estimates. This notion of regret aversion has been termed as convexity of the anticipated net advantage function in regret theory by Loomes and Sugden (1982), and has played a crucial role in explaining lottery-choice observations that are not in line with standard expected utility theory. Intuitively, it means that people generally prefer risking small regrets rather than risking large ones (Patt and Zeckhauser, 2000). Regarding health promotion, regret for wasting money is less essential compared to regret for having a health problem due to lack of effort. Moreover, disproportionate aversion to large regrets induces an effect which can be interpreted as if the decision maker overweights the reduction in the baseline risk. This interpretation sheds light on the fact that people often spend too much effort in prevention, just in case. Our theoretical results thus call for reconsideration on the practical use of willingness to pay estimates in policy making.====Nevertheless, in many other situations people do not have full knowledge about the realized state of nature and can only observe the outcome from the chosen act. For instance, wearing a mask during a pandemic can reduce the risk of being infected. But people wearing a mask and remaining healthy would possibly not know whether they could still be healthy had they not worn one. When complete feedback over forgone acts is missing, regret and rejoicing from counterfactual thinking are less relevant (e.g., Larrick and Boles, 1995; Zeelenberg, 1999; Gigerenzer and Garcia-Retamero, 2017). Following Bell (1983), we assume that the reference point under partial resolution of uncertainty is determined by rational expected utility that could have been obtained had the forgone act been chosen. This choice of reference point has some nice properties. It not only includes full resolution of uncertainty as a special case but also captures information avoidance that is widely documented in psychology (e.g., Golman et al. 2017). Consistent with these empirical findings, we find that regret aversion does not have any impact on willingness to pay when there is no direct feedback over forgone acts. Practitioners and analysts working on cost-benefit analysis may thus not need to worry much about biased risk valuations due to regret aversion as long as complete feedback over forgone acts is missing. Finally, we consider preventive measures such a vaccine that are perfectly effective and can eliminate the risk of having a health problem. What is interesting about this is that people always know what would have happened had they taken a preventive measure but the opposite is not true. We show that information avoidance induced by regret aversion can significantly bias our evaluation to prefer those health programs that completely eliminate a risk, i.e., the certainty effect. Overall, our results point out the important role of ex post information in cost-benefit analysis which is often ignored or considered as irrelevant in a rational framework.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

Despite (or, paradoxically, owing to) this remarkable progress, some parents choose to forgo or delay vaccinations for their children (Bauch and Bhattacharyya, 2012). The emergence of “hot spots” or clusters of underimmunized children in recent years could pose a serious public health risk. The importance of this issue is underscored by recent outbreaks (Patel, 2019) and by the intense debate surrounding the role of state governments in sustaining high vaccination coverage.====State laws that require proof of immunization for childcare or school attendance are an essential tool in ongoing efforts to protect children and communities from vaccine-preventable diseases. These school-based mandates function as a safety net for children who do not receive recommended vaccines as an infant or toddler, assuring widespread coverage at the time of enrollment regardless of social, economic, or environmental circumstance (Orenstein and Hinman, 1999). Prior work has shown mandates to be highly effective at increasing vaccination rates among preschool and school-aged children and in turn, lowering rates of vaccine-targeted diseases (Lawler, 2017, Abrevaya and Mulligan, 2011, Carpenter and Lawler, 2019).====Vaccine mandates are not without controversy. State legislatures must negotiate an unavoidable and complicated bargain: safeguarding public health (social welfare) while also respecting a parent's individual rights to choose (liberty). Notably, all states permit exemptions from school vaccine requirements based on medical contraindication, and most states allow parents to opt out of required immunizations based on religious belief and/or secular objections.==== Persistent growth in nonmedical exemption rates, especially in states that grant exemptions based on nonreligious personal belief, threatens to undermine the intent of vaccine mandates.==== State legislatures have countered by advancing bills that would limit vaccine exemptions.====In this paper, we provide important new evidence on how expanding the availability of exemptions for school-based mandates influences not only vaccination rates in early childhood but academic achievement in middle school. The question of whether mandatory vaccination laws, typically targeting young children prior to school entry, affect outcomes later in life is of considerable policy importance. More broadly, our analyses highlight the role of health and health-related policy in human capital production.====Our study exploits the implementation of a provision allowing philosophical, or personal belief, exemptions (PBE) from school vaccination requirements in Texas and Arkansas in 2003. These states previously allowed exemptions only for medical or religious reasons. In the first stage of our analysis, we use provider-verified data on immunization histories for children aged 19–35 months from the 1999-2006 waves of the National Immunization Survey-Child (NIS-Child). Using a difference-in-differences (DD) framework, we estimate the effects of the policy change on vaccination rates, i.e. the likelihood that a child has received all doses in the early childhood vaccine series, relative to states that do not permit PBE. We use both event-study analyses and permutation inference procedures to bolster our DD approach. In the second stage of our analysis, we use county-level estimates of average test scores for students in grades 5–7 from the 2009–2015 waves of the Stanford Education Data Archive (SEDA). Using similar empirical models and tracking the same birth cohorts from early childhood into adolescence, we estimate the long-term effects of the policy change on children's academic achievement.====We find that state policies allowing PBE for daycare and school-entry vaccination requirements diminished vaccination coverage in two subpopulations of preschool-age children. Following the 2003 policy changes, non-Hispanic Black children and children from low-income families were significantly less likely to be up to date on recommended vaccines. Although many parents seek exemptions for sincerely held religious or philosophical objections, some parents opt out of a required vaccine as a matter of convenience (Blank et al., 2013, Rota et al., 2001b).====We also find that these new state policies granting PBE had long-lasting effects on students’ performance, particularly in mathematics. The evidence is consistent with the first stage of our analysis. Due to the 2003 policy changes, non-Hispanic Black middle school students and economically disadvantaged students performed less well on standardized tests of academic achievement. This detriment was measured nearly ten years after the reported decline in vaccination coverage. Overall, our results indicate that state laws that allow personal belief exemptions for school-entry vaccine mandates may inadvertently further disadvantage marginalized communities. We find suggestive evidence for the ways in which the negative effect of PBEs on test scores may operate. After the PBE, children are less likely to go to well-child visits at young ages. This could leave early health issues undiagnosed for extended periods. In addition, we find evidence for an increase in chronic absenteeism—particularly for low-income children—in early grades. This absenteeism could have disruptive consequences for unvaccinated children, as well as their peers.====Our research contributes to the growing empirical literature on the determinants of childhood vaccination. Prior work has examined the role of compulsory immunization in sustaining and increasing vaccination coverage rates.==== Recent studies that leverage the staggered adoption of mandates across states provide credible evidence that state laws requiring certain vaccines as a condition for daycare and/or school attendance not only improve coverage rates in young children and adolescents but reduce the population-level burden of targeted vaccine-preventable disease (Lawler, 2017, Abrevaya and Mulligan, 2011, Carpenter and Lawler, 2019). Comparatively little is known about the role of state regulations governing exemptions for mandated vaccines. Richwine et al. (2019) exploit recent legislation in California to identify the causal effect of eliminating nonmedical exemptions and find that consequent gains in vaccination coverage are offset, in part, by parents’ ability to secure medical exemptions in lieu of exemptions based on personal belief. To our knowledge, the effects of state legislation that expanded exemptions for mandatory immunizations, like those enacted in Texas and Arkansas in 2003, have not yet been evaluated within a causal framework.====Finally, we contribute to the growing literature evaluating the long-term effects of health care and health-related public interventions during early childhood. Prior work has examined the role of newborn and infant health care (Bharadwaj et al., 2013, Chay et al., 2009), public health insurance (Miller and Wherry, 2019, Cohodes et al., 2016, Brown et al., 2019) the Food Stamps Program (Hoynes et al., 2016), and the 1970 Clean Air Act Amendment (Isen et al., 2017) in promoting better educational or economic outcomes later in life, typically showing that better health outcomes in childhood lead to improved human capital formation, increased labor force participation, higher earnings, and lower welfare dependency. To our knowledge, only one other study has considered the long-term effects of school-entry vaccine mandates. Leveraging the staggered introduction of mandates for the measles vaccine in the 1960s and 1970s, Luca (2016) finds that school-based immunization requirements not only reduced childhood morbidity attributable to communicable diseases but generated significant improvements in long-run educational attainment. In addition, estimated gains in years of completed schooling were twice as large among non-white (relative to white) cohorts. Using legislative changes that occurred in the early 2000s, our project is the first to document the long-term effects of state laws relaxing school vaccination requirements.====The rest of our paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we provide background information on relevant immunization policies and a brief discussion of plausible mechanisms through which state policies granting PBE could affect academic achievement. In Section 3, we describe the data we use in our main analyses. In Section 4, we outline our empirical strategy. In Section 5, we detail our results, and in Section 6 we present our conclusions.","Personal belief exemptions for school-entry vaccinations, vaccination rates, and academic achievement",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629621000497,24 April 2021,2021,Research Article,148.0

Historically, these contexts have featured incomplete credit markets and low saturation of other financial services such as savings and insurance. As such, the experience of a negative shock could exert both short and long term consequences. Households might sell off productive assets or withdraw children from school. Families may reduce food consumption and/or forego health care, as evidenced by changes in child nutrition and health.==== These reactions can harm the longer term development of human capital, and ultimately economic growth (Maccini and Yang, 2009, Alderman et al., 2006, Dercon, 2004). Over the past decade, availability of financial services has been rapidly increasing. Mobile money has become ubiquitous and markets are developing for health, life, and crop insurance. But insurance coverage remains extremely low and is typically only an option for the most privileged. And while mobile money coverage is wide, it is primarily used for transfers and payments, rather than savings. Despite these recent improvements in financial services, the poor and vulnerable still struggle to cover unexpected expenses.====A variety of interventions have been tested for improving households’ ability to cope with negative shocks.==== This study is among the first to experimentally test individual precautionary savings as a method to improve ==== shock-coping ====, and builds upon work by Dupas and Robinson (2013), Prina (2015), and Kast and Pomeranz (2014) which find that access to savings products improves the ability to cope with shocks.====The shock-coping behavior of focus in this study is transactional sex. We define this as any sex act connected to a current or future transaction of cash or gift. This includes commercial sex work, informal sex work, such as “bar girls,” and the receipt of obligatory money or gifts from boyfriends. Considerable evidence documents that material support is a significant motivation for women's sexual activity in East and Southern Africa (Wojcicki, 2002b, Wojcicki, 2002a, Masanjala, 2007, Swidler and Watkins, 2007, Wamoyi et al., 2010, Verheijen, 2011), and that women rely on transactional relationships as a form of insurance (Verheijen, 2011, Robinson and Yeh, 2011, Robinson and Yeh, 2012). LoPiccalo et al. (2012) review the evidence that negative shocks induce women to engage in more and riskier types of transactional sex, a behavior that has both long-term health implications and the potential to generate negative health externalities.==== This behavior involves multiple concurrent partnerships, which are a leading cause of the HIV/AIDS epidemic (Halperin and Epstein, 2004, LeClerc-Madlala, 2009, Mishra and Bignami-Van Assche, 2009). Transactional sex also carries other risks, such as unwanted pregnancy, exposure to gender-based violence, and challenges to mental health. This study examines whether precautionary savings can mitigate this risk-coping behavior.====We conduct a randomized field experiment among vulnerable women in Kenya to assess the impacts of savings on shock coping. We enrolled more than 600 women, including sex workers and other vulnerable women. We examine how households cope with a common financial burden – the illness and treatment of a child in the absence of health insurance. We consider other possible measures of shocks in Appendix B.2. Our intervention relies on a common mobile money platform, M-PESA, and provides existing M-PESA users with a new, second M-PESA account (“labeled account”) that is earmarked for personal savings goals (i.e. school tuition for children) and for precautionary savings for use in emergencies. Weekly SMS text messages were sent to encourage recipients of the labeled account to save for their personal goals and emergencies. The funds in the labeled account could be withdrawn at any time without penalty, making it a highly liquid form of savings. While a labeled M-PESA account does not introduce any new savings technology to our sample, the labeled account may relax two constraints to savings: social appropriation and self-control problems. Social appropriation includes claims by family and friends on an individual's resources and acts as a tax on savings (Jakiela and Ozier, 2015), while self-control problems can be varied. The labeling of a second M-PESA account may induce mental accounting and act as a soft commitment to increase savings for specific purposes (Thaler, 1999).====We test the impact of our intervention on savings balances and on the sexual behavior response to shocks. The literature on increasing savings among the poor has repeatedly documented the difficulties of measuring savings, due to privacy and misreporting. We address this issue by relying on high-quality administrative data for both existing and new, labeled M-PESA accounts to measure savings balances among all study participants. We collect high-frequency data on negative shocks and sexual behavior over a three-month time frame, pairing each respondent with a single woman enumerator to build rapport and increase accurate reporting. Using a combination of weekly surveys for the entire sample and daily diaries for a sub-sample, we are able to track both the timing of negative shocks and transactional sex over our study period. Finally, we collect additional data eight months after the intervention to test for medium-term impacts.====We have three findings. The first is that a majority of individuals in the treatment arm adopted the labeled M-PESA account, defined as making at least one deposit into the account. Balances in the labeled M-PESA account averaged about 300 KSh (==== $3.50 USD) during the study – a modest but meaningful amount. The treatment effects on total M-PESA savings, while imprecisely estimated, are non-negligible in magnitude: increases of 14% to 63% in total M-PESA savings balances. These mirror the amounts saved in the labeled M-PESA accounts, suggesting that the balances in the labeled accounts represent increases in overall mobile savings.====Our second finding is that, in the absence of any intervention, not only sex workers but also other vulnerable women rely on transactional sex as a shock-coping mechanism. When employing weekly data and estimating within-individual, we find that vulnerable women increase their sexual behavior in the week following a negative shock; in particular, transactional sex.====Our third finding, which is the main contribution of this study, is that we find that the intervention mostly mitigates this shock-coping behavior. In addition, the impacts on sex workers appear to be sustained up to eight months after the intervention. We also show evidence that the change in shock-coping behavior that we document is leading to improved health outcomes. Absent the savings intervention, women who experience a greater number of shocks over the study period are significantly more likely to report symptoms of a sexually transmitted infection. As with transactional sex, assignment to the savings intervention mitigates this effect. Overall, our results are consistent with the notion that that individuals assigned to the savings intervention are able to rely on their savings in the event of a shock instead of engaging in transactional sex; we note, however, that we cannot definitively rule out alternative explanations.====This work contributes to the substantial literature on the benefits of increasing savings for the poor.==== Many of the previous studies on this focused on whether providing access to formal bank accounts increases savings and affects downstream outcomes such as income and investments. Our study examines the effects of mobile (M-PESA) savings that typically have greater liquidity than bank savings. We provide suggestive evidence that labeling mobile savings for specific savings goals can increase savings in some populations even if the underlying technology is already widely adopted.====Further, our findings document how increasing savings affects households’ resiliency to shocks. In a related paper, Prina (2015) finds that Nepali households with access to free bank accounts are less likely to experience income drops when hit with a health shock. However, this finding is not about shock-coping behaviors ====. The author attributes this result to the improved ability of households with savings to accrue a “health capital” stock ex-ante (e.g. by consuming more meat and fish), which reduces the impact of illness on their ability to continue earning. The most closely related paper is that of Kast and Pomeranz (2014), who examine the impact of free bank accounts on reported responses to shocks in Chile. They find that major income shocks such as job loss or business downturns result in consumption cutbacks, and that the cutbacks are 44% smaller for households that received the free accounts. In contrast to these works, rather than examining major shocks, as measured over a one or three month period, we undertake detailed measurement and analysis of coping mechanisms for smaller, more frequent shocks. Further, we go beyond income and consumption to examine other shock-coping behaviors that have significant implications for welfare and potential negative externalities. We believe our study offers new knowledge on the value that savings has as a precautionary measure.====Finally, this work contributes to the literature documenting the use of transactional sex as a shock-coping mechanism in sub-Saharan Africa. In Kenya, which is the location of this study, about 20% of sexual partnerships are formed for the purpose of financial assistance (Luke et al., 2011). In Malawi, women have been documented to take on multiple sexual partnerships in response to income insecurity (Swidler and Watkins, 2007), while women in South Africa, Tanzania, and Western Kenya have been shown to respond to income shocks by increasing their level of risky unprotected sex (Dinkelman et al., 2008, Robinson and Yeh, 2011, Gong et al., 2019). This literature also offers evidence that the use of sex as shock coping is a harmful risk management strategy. Income shocks (in the form of droughts in rural areas) can explain 20% of the cross-country variation in HIV rates across Africa, a relationship for which transactional sex is the most plausible pathway (Burke et al., 2015).====These findings suggest that interventions targeting financial uncertainty may affect sexual behavior. Studies involving the provision of cash transfers have documented reductions in sexual activity (Kohler and Thornton, 2012) and sexually transmitted infections such as HIV and HSV-2 (Baird et al., 2012). However, cash transfers may have limitations in this regard; shocks require immediate cash needs while transfers are paid out at a specific point in time. Gong et al. (2019) find that conditional cash transfers were unable to mitigate the use of transactional sex by women as a response to shocks. This suggests that interventions that emphasize increasing access to liquid savings or credit may be more pivotal in changing costly shock coping behaviors such as transactional sex.====Our study advances these literatures by documenting how women can use increased savings as a safety net, allowing them to substitute away from transactional sex towards relying on their own savings to respond to negative shocks. Our findings suggest that women are better able to self-insure if given a way to accumulate precautionary savings.",Precautionary savings and shock-coping behaviors: Effects of promoting mobile bank savings on transactional sex in Kenya,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016762962100045X,22 April 2021,2021,Research Article,149.0

It is often asked as a simple question, “in general, how would you rate your health?”, where respondents select from categories such as excellent, very good, good, fair or poor. SAH is used variously in econometric models as the outcome variable, as the key explanatory variable or as a control variable to prevent health from confounding the effect of interest. However, there is a large literature calling into question the reliability of reported SAH, as up to 30% of individuals change their response when re-asked about their SAH (Crossley and Kennedy, 2002, Clarke and Ryan, 2006, Black et al., 2017a). This paper takes advantage of recent econometric developments on misclassification and information from a prominent longitudinal survey—the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey—to gain new insights into the nature of misclassification in reported SAH and its potential for biasing estimates of the effects of SAH and other explanatory variables in health econometrics models. In particular, our analysis uses data from the 2001 wave of HILDA, which records the same individual's SAH responses in two different but similar questionnaires in the same wave (face-to-face or over-the-phone interview, and on a self-completion questionnaire), and combines this information with longitudinal data on mortality and the development of chronic health conditions 15 years later. We develop a new likelihood-based nonlinear estimator which uses this information to jointly estimate the misclassification in both reported SAH measures as well as the effects of SAH on mortality and morbidity.====Two independent misclassified measures of a categorical variable, such as SAH, supplemented with data on an outcome, such as mortality, can identify all the misclassification probabilities and the effect of the variable on the outcome (Hu, 2008, Hu, 2017). This can be done without imposing virtually any restrictions on the misclassification patterns, such as assuming that the probabilities of certain forms of misclassification are zero, that certain misclassification probabilities are larger than others, or that the misclassification probabilities are the same for both SAH measures. In our case, the flexibility of allowing that each measure may have differing levels of misclassification is important because the mode with which the question was asked is different.==== While infinitely many misclassification patterns are compatible with the observed data on only two reported SAH measures,==== adding information about an outcome affected by SAH such as mortality allows us to pin down the misclassification probabilities. The reason is that each possible misclassification pattern implies a unique distribution of SAH within each reporting group, so that the average outcome within each group provides the missing information needed to reveal the misclassification pattern present in the reported SAH data. For instance, consider (====) the group of individuals reporting “excellent” health according to the first measure and “very good” according to the second, versus (====) the group responding “excellent” in both. If the individuals in both groups are mainly in “excellent” health, then they should have similar mortality. But if the individuals in (====) are mainly in “very good” health whereas those in (====) are mainly in “excellent” health, then the mortality of group (====) is likely to be different to the mortality of (====). Thus, looking at these three variables jointly (the two reported SAH plus mortality) can identify all underlying misclassification probabilities. And, conversely, because identifying misclassification is tantamount to knowing the underlying distribution of SAH within each group, it also makes it possible to back out the true impact of SAH on the outcome. In the next section (Section 2), we present a more detailed example of this identification strategy, and in Section 3 we show how this formally generalises to a full econometric model which can be richly parametrised in terms of covariates. However, estimating such a model is not straightforward.====While Hu (2008) discusses a nonparametric estimator for this setting, the implementation of that estimator is non-trivial and its computation is prohibitive when, as in our case, the model has many covariates, the potentially misclassified variable (SAH) has many categories, and the sample size is large.==== Therefore, we develop a more easily implementable parametric likelihood-based estimator. An important advantage of our estimator is that the effects of categorical SAH are specified by including dummy variables for each category of SAH in the outcome model, the standard way SAH is included as a categorical regressors in the health economics literature. Our approach also lends itself easily to specifications with interaction effects where the impact of unobserved SAH differs depending on other individual characteristics. Such specifications, common in applied work to investigate the heterogeneity of the effect of SAH, have received little attention in the misclassification literature so far. Another advantage is that, because the model has a finite-mixture representation, our estimation approach is a flexible parametric specification estimated via a standard expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm, which offers fast and reliable computation. The flexibility and richness of our model, where we allow unrestricted patterns of misclassification that depend on all covariates, means that the likelihood is complex and difficult to maximise. The EM algorithm provides the key to a simpler and more direct path to the solution. By holding misclassification constant in the maximisation step, the resulting log likelihood is substantially simpler: it becomes additively separable, so that components can quickly be maximised separately. Moreover, because it is likelihood-based, our estimator can be easily adapted to encompass several outcomes jointly (such as, in our case, mortality and chronic morbidity) and be further extended to consider the pensalisation of misclassification parameters to improve stability and efficiency. Section 4 provides simulation evidence on our estimators finite sample performance.====The focus of this paper is the application of our proposed estimator to the HILDA data with the aim of making two key contributions to the health economics literature. First, we go beyond the current literature which only documents observed differences in multiple reported measures of SAH, typically by regressing an indicator of conflicting SAH answers on a set of explanatory variables (Black et al., 2017a). As an example of the difficulties associated with interpreting some of the estimates produced with this method, consider for instance the finding that individuals with lower education are more prone to giving conflicting SAH answers when asked twice. It is generally not possible to conclude from such a finding which of the two reported SAH questions is answered more accurately, and which types of specific mistakes are made with which frequency. It is not even possible to conclude that individuals with lower education tend to have generally higher rates of misclassification than higher education individuals, since it could be, for instance, that face-to-face SAH from low education individuals is much less reliable, while self-completed SAH from low education individuals is somewhat ==== reliable. In contrast to these reduced-form approaches, our new framework provides estimates of the complete set of probabilities of misreporting each category of each measure by covariates such as education, income, etc. By linking differences in SAH to underlying misclassification probabilities, it makes it possible to address behavioural questions about the extent, patterns and heterogeneity of individuals’ responses. It also makes it possible to assess questions pertaining to survey methodology, such as the type and incidence of response errors associated with each of the two survey instruments—face-to-face interview and self-completion questionnaire.====Second, our results make it possible to assess how biased conventional estimates of the effects of reported SAH are by misclassification. In our approach, the outcome model takes the form of a standard nonlinear model, such as a logit model, and can be specified not just in terms of SAH but also by including a vector of covariates. This makes it straightforward to compare our estimates of the outcome model to naïve estimates which ignore misclassification—that is, simple logit models of mortality and morbidity that include either the first or second reported SAH measure, as widely encountered in the health economics literature. Our estimator provides a way to adjust for misclassification in reported SAH when estimating the effects of SAH on mortality and morbidity in such models. As mentioned above, once the misclassification probabilities are identified, the effect of SAH on, say, mortality can be backed out because, for each reported SAH group, the group's distribution of SAH can be inferred and linked to the group's mortality. Similarly, our approach also makes it possible to assess how biases stemming from misclassification of reported SAH affect the estimates of ==== regressors of interest. Such spillover of the bias in reported SAH to other regressors can occur if the latter are correlated to SAH. Intuitively, one can understand the use of reported SAH as introducing a type of omitted variable problem: part of SAH is missing in the reported measure. If covariates are correlated to SAH (and thus also to the omitted part of SAH), this will bias the coefficients on these other variables. And due to the bias on the effect of SAH itself, even the non-omitted part is not being adjusted for appropriately, which will also further spill over to these correlated variables. Bago d’Uva et al. (2011) also look at such spillovers, albeit for a different outcome and with an approach based on vignettes.====Understanding and dealing with measurement errors in SAH has been and still is an active area of research within health econometrics. While Greene et al. (2018) and Brown et al. (2018) adjust for untruthful reporting in discrete dependent variable models, our focus lies in the case of discrete SAH taking the role of a regressor. In models seeking to explain labour supply decisions a key focus has been on individuals misclassifying (under-reporting) their SAH to justify not working (Bound, 1991, Currie and Madrian, 1999, Lindeboom and Kerkhofs, 2009, Black et al., 2017b).==== This can be problematic in these models because it can upwardly bias the estimated coefficient on SAH, but what is less commonly noted is that other reasons why SAH is misclassified will cause bias in the other direction (Bound, 1991). In the current paper, we consider ‘to justify not working’ as one of many reasons which may explain an individual's propensity (or probability) to misclassify their SAH. Our estimator can fully account for misclassification related to work status or any other factor, as long as the respondents are not misclassifying SAH to justify the outcome we use for identification (in our case mortality or the onset of chronic condition 15 years in the future). Our paper also contributes to the literature which investigates the association between “objective” and self-assessed health measures (Bound, 1991, Mossey and Shapiro, 1982, Butler et al., 1987, Baker et al., 2004, Doiron et al., 2015). We consider substantially longer-term associations between SAH and mortality (and morbidity) than in these studies (15 years vs 3–6 years), and we adjust the association by accounting for misclassification in reported SAH. The most closely related studies to ours are Crossley and Kennedy (2002), Clarke and Ryan (2006) and Black et al. (2017a), which also consider the change in an individual's response when SAH is asked twice; however, none of these papers estimates the impact of misclassification when reported SAH is used as a regressor, nor do they study the underlying misclassification probabilities.====Our main results are discussed in Sections 5 and 6. In Section 5, we document the empirical salience of the problem of differing answers to repeated SAH questions throughout the HILDA survey, which motivates our research, and we replicate the previous literature's reduced-form results by regressing these differences in SAH responses on covariates. As discussed, it is difficult to link such results to the underlying misclassification. Section 6 presents the results using our estimator on the HILDA data, which overcomes these problems. We find strong evidence for the presence of misclassification and for heterogeneity in misreporting behaviour across different population subgroups, such as males vs females and low vs high income earners. For instance, we find that men who are in excellent health almost never fail to report this in interviews, but not all men who report being in excellent health are truthfully reporting their SAH. We also document that there is less measurement error in the SAH question elicited by face-to-face interviews than in the one from the self-completion questionnaire. The results indicate that misclassification leads to statistically significant biases in the parameters of the mortality and morbidity models. While the bias is similar in absolute size across the models, this translates to relative biases in the coefficients of SAH ranging mostly from 10% to 20% in the mortality model, and as high as 100% for the morbidity model. For the coefficients of other covariates, the biases, while statistically significant, are more moderate and around 10%. Finally, we use our approach to estimate potential heterogeneity in the effect of SAH by specifying models with interactions of SAH with sex, age, education and income. With the exception of gender differences in mortality, the results indicate that the long-term effects of SAH on mortality and new chronic conditions are quite homogenous.====We conclude the paper in Section 7. Our findings suggest that when specifying models where SAH is the regressor of interest, it is important to adjust for misclassification. In case this is not possible, SAH measures from face-to-face interviews should be strongly preferred over self-completed SAH measures. On the other hand, our findings also indicate that when specifying models where SAH is used as a key control variable, there is likely to be little contamination of the variables of interest from the misclassification in SAH.",The effects of self-assessed health: Dealing with and understanding misclassification bias,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629621000485,22 April 2021,2021,Research Article,150.0

We shed light on this tradeoff empirically, by combining detailed time use data with a natural experiment created by differential access to publicly funded kindergarten across households and states. We find a substantial elasticity between informal care supply and kindergarten access, especially for female carers. In fact, for women, kindergarten access appears to largely increase their care supply rather than labor supply.","Informal caregiving is the principal source of care for older and disabled people in the United States (and in many other countries).==== Indeed, informal caregiving by family and friends has in the majority of cases (about 70%) become the sole source of long-term care, while more than 90% of disabled elderly receive at least some informal care (Spillman and Pezzin, 2000, Spillman and Black, 2005, Doty, 2010, Houser et al., 2010, Kaye et al., 2010, Freedman and Spillman, 2014, Ankuda and Levine, 2016). The supply of informal care for the elderly has therefore traditionally been the subject of considerable academic and policy interest. In recent years, this interest has intensified for a number of reasons: First, the repeal of the long-term care provisions contained in the Affordable Care Act has signaled that informal caregiving will continue to be the principal source of long-term care for the foreseeable future. Second, demand-side factors such as population aging, increasing racial/ethnic diversity, as well as increasing rates of chronic conditions, have the potential to increase the demand for long-term care (Norton, 2000, Wolf, 2001, Yang et al., 2003).====Whether this increased demand can be adequately accommodated by informal caregivers is an important question, given that caregivers face multiple competing demands on their time, which are also evolving as a result of demographic trends. In particular, the trend towards delayed fertility implies that potential caregivers (especially women) are increasingly likely to face simultaneous child care and elder care responsibilities (Spillman and Pezzin, 2000). This is an important consideration that is not however routinely taken into account in the traditional framework of time-tradeoffs, which tends to focus on the narrow tradeoff between work and caregiving activities. In reality, many caregivers are allocating time between at last three time-intensive activities – caregiving, work and childcare – and the relevant opportunity cost of time is not necessarily measured by the market wage. Pierret (2006) and Suh (2016) estimate that a sizeable subset of adult women in the United States provide significant amounts of care to both children as well as parents.==== Among informal caregivers, nearly 1 in 5 are simultaneously providing care to children under the age of 12.==== This dual responsibility results in greater strain on caregivers’ mental health, and also, unsurprisingly, results in a lower supply of informal care, compared to other caregivers (Rubin and White-Means, 2009).====In this paper, we utilize time-use data from the American Time Use Survey to examine the tradeoff between the two kinds of care. To provide a clear policy focus for our study, we examine whether the supply of informal care is elastic with respect to publicly subsidized child care/schooling. We focus on full-day kindergarten, whose provision exhibits substantial variation across states, partly due to differences in state-level statutory requirements. We take advantage of these differences in statutory requirements, in conjunction with variation in household eligibility for kindergarten based on the age of the youngest child, to estimate the effect of full-day kindergarten access on caregiving using a difference-in-differences identification strategy.====Within an extended time-tradeoff framework, the relaxation of the childcare constraint may result in an increase in either work hours or caregiving, or both. For some individuals the marginal benefit from caregiving may be greater than the benefit from additional paid work, and these individuals may utilize the freed-up time to provide informal care, while conversely some individuals may reallocate the majority of the extra time to paid work. ==== we do not know the relative proportions of these two types of individuals in the population. The aggregate (or average) effect of childcare subsidies on caregiving is therefore an empirical issue, but has not received attention in the existing literature: On the one hand, studies of caregiving typically examine the effect of health care or labor market interventions, while on the other hand, studies looking at the effects of childcare subsidies tend to focus on labor market effects.====Our analysis reveals that access to full-day kindergarten has a large and statistically significant effect on both the probability of being a caregiver, as well as on the amount of care provided. A variety of placebo tests confirm the causal validity of the estimates: We find no significant effects for households whose children are not age-eligible, and no significant effect of kindergarten eligibility of the oldest child. We also find that the increases in caregiving are concentrated in days when schools are in session (weekdays and non-summer months). We also test for and rule out any compositional effects that may be confounding the estimates. The increase in caregiving is more pronounced among women, non-Whites, non-college educated, and those not currently working. Interestingly, we do not find significant effects of full-day kindergarten provision on labor supply, of either men or women.====The significance of these findings is twofold. First, in the absence of a well-functioning and affordable formal chronic care system, public policies that can support informal caregiving are critical. The academic debate surrounding this issue has emphasized the opportunity costs of caregiving in terms of lost income (i.e., the trade-off between work and caregiving), and this is also reflected in the policy debate which centers around flexible work arrangements, mandated (paid or unpaid) leave, direct compensation of caregivers, etc.==== Relatively little attention, however, has been paid to the trade-off between child-rearing and caregiving. Our results suggest that this is an important omission, and that targeting the trade-off between child care and caregiving may be an effective complement to policies that target work arrangements.====Second, our findings are also significant in the context of the recent literature on the effect of child-care subsidies on maternal labor supply. The argument that child-care subsidies can crowd-in maternal employment is often cited as a supporting rationale for such subsidies (e.g., Karoly and Bigelow, 2005). The empirical evidence in this regard is however mixed. Whereas a number of earlier studies (e.g., Gelbach, 2002; Blau and Tekin, 2007, Baker et al., 2008) consistently found maternal labor supply to be elastic with respect to the child care subsidies implicit in publicly funded pre-school programs, studies that have used more recent data tend to find much weaker (and sometimes zero) effects (Fitzpatrick, 2010, Havnes and Mogstad, 2011, Cascio and Schanzenbach, 2013), thereby undermining an important rationale for the provision of such subsidies. Our findings suggest that the margin of adjustment may actually be caregiving rather than labor supply, and that accounting for this channel has the potential to alter the cost-benefit assessment of child-care subsidies. More broadly, our study makes the case for a more extensive approach to policy evaluation that considers policy impacts that manifest in different domains than are being directly targeted by the policy.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the data, Section 3 presents some descriptive evidence on dual-carers and the tradeoff between informal caregiving and child-care; Section 4 presents the main analysis, and Section 5 concludes.",The effect of subsidized childcare on the supply of informal care: Evidence from public kindergarten provision in the US,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629621000436,20 April 2021,2021,Research Article,151.0

Their excess mortality during March and April was similar to the general population. We compare candidates in cities with two candidate lists to those in cities with only one list, as elections are more intense in contacts in the former group. We also use a ==== and investigate mortality in 2020 depending on how candidates fared in the 2014 election. We cannot detect any causal effect of active participation in the 2020 elections on mortality.","In early 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic has forced most of the planet to stop any non-essential activity involving large groups of people until ==== is eventually controlled. Whether one should consider elections an essential activity in this context has become a matter of intense debates leading to dramatically different decisions across the globe. Some governments have postponed elections (local elections in Austria, Italy & UK, Ohio primaries), some have switched to mail-in voting (Poland, Alaska primaries), and others have decided to hold the elections as planned with further sanitary precautions (Israel, South Korea, Wisconsin primaries). The empirical evidence to guide public policy is very scarce, owing to how sudden the Covid-19 outbreak has been and to the small number of elections held since it began.====This paper seeks to bridge this gap: we measure the impact of holding the first round of French town hall elections on the mortality of the individuals it exposed the most to Covid-19, i.e. politicians. These elections provide an unusual setting as they were held at the apex of the epidemic in France – on Sunday the 15th of March 2020 – one day after the nationwide closure of non-essential retail businesses was ordered and two days before a shelter-at-home order.====Our analysis is based on individual death records from the French institute of statistics (Insee) matched with a public registry of candidates in town hall elections. The resulting dataset enables us to compare the mortality rates of male candidates in the 2014 and 2020 municipal elections relative to the general population as well as depending on the degree of participation into the 2020 election.====, since electoral success in the prior election has a large impact on active participation in the 2020 election. This strategy identifies the impact of running in the 2020 election at the individual level.====Three main sets of findings emerge from our empirical exercise. First, we compute the mortality rates in March and April 2020 among candidates in the March 15th election. This is a group of around 900,000 individuals, representing 1.8% of the adult French population. They were among the most likely to contract the disease as they actively participated in the campaign and closely monitored the voting process on election day. Many of them also belong to ==== groups with a high risk of dying from Covid-19: 160,000 candidates were men aged between 60 and 79 years old, representing 2.6% of their category in the general population. We compare their mortality rates with overall mortality rates among individuals of same gender and same age. We find that, across March and April 2020, candidates died significantly less than members of the general population from the same age bracket. The weekly mortality rate among men aged between 60 and 79 years old from March to April was 4 for 10,000 in the general population against 1 for 10,000 among town hall candidates. This could reflect selection into candidacy based on good health. However, we do not find that this mortality “advantage” was smaller in areas where Covid-19 had the greatest incidence, i.e. the Ile-de-France and Grand-Est regions. The difference in mortality rates between the two groups was also of similar size around the onset of the epidemic and during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in the fall of 2020, well after the election. This further suggests the excess mortality of candidates due to Covid-19 was in fact similar to the general population.====Second, we compare the mortality of candidates in cities where two candidate lists compete with the mortality of candidates in cities where there is only one candidate list. In the data, the number of competing candidate lists is a very strong determinant of turnout. Yet, we do not find any difference in mortality among candidates between the two types of cities, even though they otherwise do not differ much in observable characteristics. The lack of effect of electoral competition on mortality during the pandemic holds not only in the pool of candidates but also among city residents in general, which further suggests the lack of a large effect of holding the elections on epidemic diffusion.====Third, in order to go beyond estimating citywide effects of the election on mortality, we investigate the mortality patterns of the people who were candidates in the previous municipal elections, held in 2014. We find that, among them, those who decided to run again in 2020 were not more likely to die from March to April 2020. Using a regression discontinuity design, we observe that candidates in 2014 are far more likely to participate again in 2020 if their candidate list had won the election in 2014. However, we do not detect any significant effect of winning the election in 2014 on mortality in March-April 2020. This further confirms, using an entirely different identification strategy, that intense participation in the 2020 elections did not generate any specific mortality risk.====This is to our knowledge the first paper to document the mortality patterns of politicians in the middle of a Covid-19 pandemic. It is of interest in its own right as politicians are key decision-makers whose good health is of paramount value in times of crisis. By the nature of their occupation, politicians may also be more likely to contract the disease. Examples of how this has hampered policy-making abound: at certain times in the epidemic, the UK and the US governments were leaderless while the French National Assembly had to stop its proceedings once an internal cluster developed.==== The main research hurdle is to obtain a large enough sample of politicians to analyze. In this respect, our setting, which includes more than 160,000 politicians with significant exposure to mortality from Covid-19, provides a unique opportunity.====Our research also innovates by investigating the effects of elections on the diffusion of Covid-19 using individual data. Several studies have by now investigated this issue at higher levels of aggregation and for the general population. Some of this research (====, ====, ====) has focused on Covid-19 outcomes measured at the level of each county and related them to turnout at the same level of aggregation, with conflicting results.==== Those analyses seek to explain and predict the full development of the epidemic. This comes at the cost of making strong assumptions on the behavior of the disease and its diffusion patterns. This is why we focus instead on a narrower goal of identifying individual transmissions of the disease that were directly caused by the election.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section ==== documents the context of the French election as well as the data we use. Section ==== discusses the hindrances to a causal identification and the solutions we implement.

Taking the example of antidepressant drugs, we use French panel data on exhaustive prescriptions made by a representative sample of general practitioners to more than 110,000 depressed ==== authorities. We identify the effect of this unexpected warning on physicians’ drug choices while addressing the possibility that ==== heterogeneity may be correlated with unobserved physician characteristics. While the warning decreased the average probability of prescribing SSRIs, we find that physicians’ responses to the warning were very heterogeneous and larger if the physician had a higher preference for prescribing SSRIs before the warning.","Understanding physicians’ prescribing behavior is important for public health and public finance. Physician prescription activity depends on physicians’ judgment and continuous updating of their medical knowledge through scientific information and the public recommendations of health authorities. Moreover, prescription of treatments to patients is a difficult and partially subjective choice that implies cost–benefit trade-offs depending on drug efficacy, patient condition and the evaluation of both by the physician.====Using an important medical information change disseminated through a public warning by health authorities, we study whether and how recommendations affect physicians’ decision-making, using the example of antidepressant drugs in France. We use panel data covering 2000 to 2008 and containing exhaustive prescriptions made by a representative sample of 386 general practitioners to more than 110,000 depressed patients. As medical journals publish new evidence and public health authorities adjust their recommendations, doctors may update their prescribing behavior. During the study period, important new evidence on antidepressants’ efficacy and side effects were published and transmitted through new official recommendations to physicians. There were new results in 2004 showing that using selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for depression treatment increases suicidal thinking in kids and adolescents. After such events and medical warnings, physicians must update their beliefs on different drug treatments and may react differently to these warnings.====We first show some difference-in-difference estimation of the change in the prescription probability of SSRI drugs before and after the warning for kids and adolescents relative to other antidepressants and to older patients. The evidence shows a decline in the prescriptions of SSRIs and placebo regressions show that it coincides with the time of the warning. As such difference-in-difference estimation cannot disentangle the effect of the warning on the preferences for the different types of drugs, we use a discrete choice model to estimate physician preferences.====We develop a model of prescribing behavior with physician and patient heterogeneity and show how we can identify the effect of a warning on individual physicians’ specific preferences when unobserved heterogeneity in patients’ health state may be correlated with physicians’ heterogeneity. Such a correlation could be the result of endogenous matching on unobservable characteristics between physicians and patients. Assuming stable preferences of physicians during the periods before and after the warning, we can assess whether the heterogeneity in treatments is due to unobservable differences in patient or physician preferences (on drug efficacy or side effects, for example). We are able to test not only whether changing scientific information affects physicians’ prescriptions but also whether it affects physicians differently. Our decision model allows us to conduct counterfactual analysis and investigate the impact of different policies on physicians’ prescribing behavior which would not be possible with reduced form analysis.====Our empirical results show that physicians’ behavior is very heterogeneous in terms of propensity to prescribe different kinds of antidepressants and that government warnings also have very heterogeneous effects on physicians’ prescribing behavior. We find that physicians prescribe antidepressants to kids and adolescents less often after the warning, but many still do not adhere to the recommendation. SSRIs are still prescribed to this age group by 62% of physicians, despite the warning advising against this. We observe that prescription of SSRIs to kids and adolescents decreases in favor of either serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) or drugs other than antidepressants. We also find that after the warning, the probability of prescribing an SSRI to young adults, adults and elderly people changes very heterogeneously across physicians. It seems that some physicians interpret the warning as “good” or “bad” news for age groups other than kids and adolescents.====Finally, thanks to a counterfactual simulation of the decision model, we evaluate the substitution of SSRIs towards other drug categories that would result from a ban on prescriptions of SSRI drugs to kids and adolescents and compare the substitution patterns with those in the case of the warning. Banning SSRIs for kids and adolescents leads to a substitution to other alternatives just like the warning does, but of course all SSRI prescriptions disappear and are replaced by alternatives. However, the ban leads to a lower level of substitution to other antidepressants and a higher level of substitution towards drugs other than antidepressants, relative to the warning. In other words, a physician stopping to prescribe SSRIs to kids and adolescents after a warning is more likely to substitute with any other antidepressant than he or she would do in the case of a ban. This happens because the warning seems to less negatively affect the preferences for non-SSRI antidepressants compared to drugs other than antidepressants.====Our work adds some empirical evidence on the role of information in physicians’ prescribing behavior. Previous literature on prescribing behavior has addressed issues related to physician-induced demand (Mcguire, 2000, Dickstein, 2016) and its relationship to drug prices, patient co-payments and the availability of generic drugs, as well as physician learning (Ching, 2010, Coscielli and Shum, 2004, Crawford and Shum, 2005, Dickstein, 2018, Janakiraman et al., 2009, Ching et al., 2013, Ching and Lim, 2020). Our work relates to the evidence on the role of physicians’ heterogeneity of skills, beliefs and preferences, which has been documented recently (Berndt et al., 2015, Currie and Macleod, 2017, Currie and Macleod, 2020, Cutler et al., 2019). Cutler et al. (2019) shows how much regional variation in health-care expenditures in the US comes from patient demand-side factors as opposed to physician supply-side factors. The results show that the most important factor is physician beliefs about treatment. Berndt et al. (2015) shows that many psychiatrists have significantly heterogeneous prescription patterns and concentrate on distinct drugs. The authors find some evidence of a relationship between prescription volumes and prescribing behavior that is consistent with a learning-by-doing model among physicians. Stern and Trajtenberg (1998) show that the exercise of physician authority is likely to be related to skills. Finally, Currie and Macleod (2020) investigate how physician diagnostic skills, tastes, and beliefs impact physician decision-making. The authors use a model in which physician experimentation allows for learning about the match quality between a particular drug and an individual in the case of antidepressant medication.====While there is extensive literature on physicians’ learning and experimentation, papers studying the role of new scientific evidence and public recommendations on physicians’ prescriptions are sparse. Some have evaluated how prescriptions change after drug withdrawal. Collins et al. (2013) show that the Vioxx withdrawal had both positive and negative effects for specific substitute drugs and led to an overall increase in the usage of competing products. Berez et al. (2018) study the physicians’ response to information on ineffectiveness of pulmonary artery catheters (PACs). They find that the use of PACs declined after the release of evidence on the lack of benefit from their use and that older physicians’ use of PACs was influenced by the practice patterns of their junior colleagues. Howard et al. (2017) use a negative informational shock (namely the fact that a common knee operation does not improve outcomes for patients with osteoarthritis) to study the impact of physicians’ agency relationships on treatment decisions. They show that providers at physician-owned surgery centers abandoned common knee surgeries at a lesser rate than physicians practicing in hospitals. Howard and Hockenberry (2019) show that episiotomy rate declined from 54% in 1994 to 13% in 2010 but that older physicians were more likely to perform it and were slower to adjust their practices in response to evidence showing that routine episiotomy is unnecessary. Physician beliefs are crucial to explaining their heterogeneous prescribing behavior (Berndt et al., 2015) and are also directly affected by both scientific knowledge and personal experience with their patients. Our new approach and results shed light on how to evaluate the impact of medical warnings on physicians and on their wide heterogeneity of responses.====The paper proceeds as follows: In Section 2, we first present some background descriptive information on antidepressants, public health warnings and recommendations, the data and some stylized descriptive statistics. Section 3 shows reduced form evidence of the effect of the warning on prescriptions. Section 4 presents our model and identification strategy.

Most studies examining this question rely on two broad strategies. One strategy, focusing on timely and short peaks of crime, indicates that pregnancies exposed to a homicide, terrorist attack, or sexual assault in utero have significantly worse birth outcomes than pregnancies giving birth just before such events and therefore not exposed (Koppensteiner and Manacorda, 2016, Camacho, 2008, Persson and Rossin-Slater, 2018). A second strategy compares pregnancies in areas exposed or not exposed to armed conflicts, bombings, and wars to show that local escalations in crime strongly predict worse birth outcomes (Brown, 2018, Mansour and Rees, 2012, Akresh et al., 2012, Bobonis et al., 2020). This paper takes a different approach by focusing on the opposite direction. It asks whether increases in policing in areas historically ruled by illegal armed gangs prevent (or even reverse) the adverse effects of crime on birth outcomes.====Evidence for this question comes from quasi-experimental ==== intrauterine shocks of policing caused by police operations in Rio de Janeiro's favelas. Symbolically called “pacifications” to reinforce the notion of restoring peace, these operations involved the deployment of police squads specially trained to occupy difficult-to-access areas and introduced “Pacifying Police Units” (UPP) in favelas to provide ==== policing. According to the government, UPPs aim to “restore the monopoly of the state in the use of force and to reduce criminal levels, especially of lethal violence” (Decreto 45.186, 2015).====Notably, two characteristics make the use of pacifications empirically compelling. The first relates to the pacification dates, i.e., the exact day when the police arrived in favelas and provoked significant reductions in crime. The second characteristic is the decree setting official geographic limits for policing (hereafter, UPP borders), delimiting the areas that would be exposed or not to the shock. Fig. 1 illustrates these points by showing the rate of police actions per 10,000 people residing within UPP borders one year before and after the pacification dates. Detailed data on police activities corroborates the behaviour shown in Fig. 1 for several categories of crime (see Table 1). Sections S.1 and S.5 in the ==== present the list of pacification dates and maps from the ==== UPPs on which this analysis is based.====Because families can decide endogenously when and where to become pregnant, the identification strategy combines information on time and geography of pacifications and pregnant women in Rio de Janeiro. On the pacification side, the exact dates of police arrivals are provided by the Instituto de Seguraça Pública (ISP), while detailed maps of favelas are from UPP Social, SABREN, and BASEGEO – all platforms offered by the government. On the pregnant women side, I use restricted data of live births from the ==== (SINASC) between January 2007 and December 2015, which provides conception dates, measured by doctors during prenatal care, and detailed home addresses during pregnancy. To deal with the issue that longer pregnancies are more likely to experience pacifications in utero than shorter pregnancies, I use the ==== dates of birth at conception (i.e., 9 months after conception) as an exogenous measure of gestational length (Persson and Rossin-Slater, 2018, Currie et al., 2020, Black et al., 2016). By combining the information on timing of pregnancies and pacification dates, I argue that pregnancies conceived before but ==== to end around the pacification dates were “quasi-randomly” exposed to positive in utero shocks on policing.====Three empirical strategies emerge from combining the geographic information from pacified favelas and the home addresses of pregnant women. The baseline approach checks for changes in birth outcomes at pacification dates for pregnancies within UPP borders residing on the same street. The second model estimates spillover effects by restricting the sample to pregnancies residing just outside UPP areas, and consequently not directly exposed to the police's arrival.==== The third strategy unifies both models and compares the trends of birth outcomes on opposite sides of UPP borders before and after pacification dates. These strategies assume that pregnancies living on the same street with expected dates of birth weeks around the pacification dates are unlikely to be systematically different, other than the in-utero exposure to pacifications.====Baseline regressions indicate that experiencing pacifications in utero improved birth outcomes by ==== standard deviation. On average, this result represents that pregnancies exposed to pacifications during the third trimester had ==== g higher birth weight and approximately ====pp lower risk of low birth weight than pregnancies residing on the same street but giving birth before police arrived. No effects were found for exposure during the first or second trimesters of gestation, or for Low APGAR ====-min, C-Section deliveries, or risk of congenital malformations. These conclusions are robust for specifications using alternative control groups, combining covariates, and considering hospital and street fixed effects. The pacification effects occur only for pregnancies exposed in utero: dummies for births occurring days before police arrived in favelas suggest no significant changes in birth outcomes.====Why would exposure to policing shocks during the third trimester improve birth weight? I investigate some potential channels. The first set of estimates finds small gains in gestational length (==== days), but they hardly explain a large fraction of the pacification effects. In contrast, much stronger evidence comes from prenatal care. Using the categories of prenatal visits available in SINASC, I show that pregnancies exposed to pacifications during the third trimester present significant reductions in the probability of having between ==== and ==== prenatal visits (an impact of ====pp or 16.3% the baseline mean). As literature shows for other contexts (Evans and Lien, 2005, Gajate-Garrido, 2013, Jewell and Triunfo, 2006), prenatal visits can improve birth weight in the third trimester if safer favelas promoted access to prenatal care that was originally unavailable.====Additional estimates also indicate that the probability of attending seven or more prenatal visits increased by ====pp for in utero exposure in the third or in the first trimester of gestation. Despite a long dispute in the medical literature on the adequate number of prenatal visits (Fiscella, 1995) for a review), it is widely argued that more frequent visits in the last months of pregnancy are critical to birth outcomes (WHO, 2016). Prenatal visits allow medical professionals to monitor preventable morbidity and mortality (WHO, 2016), other perinatal risks, and provide emotional support as the term approaches (Ministério da Saúde, Brasil, 2006).====The increase in the number of prenatal visits within UPP borders is not explained by changes in the supply of health services. Using geocoded information of hospitals to proxy the supply of health services in pacified favelas (as in Bloom et al., 2015) reveals that hospital structure (including the number of rooms and beds for pre-birth and obstetric centres) and health personnel (obstetricians, obstetric nurses, and hours worked per week) remained unaltered at pacification dates. This approach also allows for an alternative explanation for my findings: pacifications may reduce the level of stress and anxiety during pregnancy and, as a consequence, affect foetal growth (Masi et al., 2007, Kramer, 1987, Torche, 2011). Estimates exploring ==== million patient admissions in Rio de Janeiro suggest no change in the incidence of stress and anxiety among women, or in the number of foetal deaths and abortions in hospitals located within and nearby UPP borders. Even though it is naturally difficult to rule out the influence of other factors, these results give support to the argument that the pacification effects on birth outcomes are mainly through increases in prenatal visits.====The second strategy complements these conclusions by showing negligible spillover effects of pacifications on pregnancies residing in areas circumventing UPP borders. Such an absence reflects the fact that observed crime rates did not change significantly outside of pacified favelas after pacifications, indicating no effects on birth outcomes when no in utero shocks associated with policing and crime occurs. In addition, given the inelasticity in the supply of health services around UPPs, the higher number of prenatal visits for pregnancies residing within UPP areas seems to occur at the expense of women residing outside UPP areas. Estimates for pregnancies outside UPP areas show that the probability of seven or more prenatal visits decreases when they are exposed during the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Overall, computing both impacts, the police arrival in favelas narrowed the outside-inside UPP gap on prenatal visits by 15%.====Lastly, a third approach suggests that self-selection is unlikely to explain these findings. If pregnancies residing in the same area have similar probabilities of anticipating pacifications, comparing the changes in birth outcomes of women residing geographically close during the pacification dates would control for these biases. Undertaking this strategy confirms previous findings and shows that pacification effects persist, even after comparing pregnancies at the UPP border. Likewise, because the exact pacification dates were not publicly announced by the police, the sample is restricted to pregnancies starting before pacification dates, and robustness checks excluding weeks before pacification dates only replicates previous findings, I conclude that anticipation of police arrival is not the source of my conclusions.====In addition to this introduction, Section 2 describes the police operations pacifying the favelas in Rio de Janeiro and their impacts on crime rates; Section 3 explains the geocoding of home addresses and presents descriptive statistics of birth outcomes and mothers’ characteristics; Section 4 explains the identification strategy, and the baseline results are shown in Section 5. Section 6 presents pacification effects on opposite sides of UPP borders and uses false (random) pacification dates.

However, this was compensated by increases from untaxed categories, such that total calories purchased did not change. We find increases in cholesterol (====), sodium (====), carbohydrates (====), and proteins (====).","Obesity and its associated chronic illnesses are a growing and costly health problem affecting both developed and developing countries. Since 1980, worldwide obesity rates have almost tripled, while the prevalence of diabetes and hypertension has doubled (Gracner, 2015, WHO, 2002). Mexico and the U.S. rank among the most obese countries in the world, with one third of their adult population being obese.====While the high costs of obesity are undeniable, debate continues over which policies might best combat the problem. Proposals span a wide spectrum (Cawley, 2015), including increasing the availability of drinking water, mandating nutritional labeling, launching media campaigns promoting healthier lifestyles,==== and limiting the serving sizes of certain high-caloric foods (OECD, 2014). Several international institutions and various policy-makers strongly advocate for taxes on high caloric foods and sugary drinks, but there is still controversy around it.==== Several countries have already implemented or are discussing such measures (Allcott et al., 2019b).====On January 1st, 2014, the Mexican government introduced two national levies as part of Mexico's Special Tax on Production and Services (====). Drinks with added sugar were taxed at one peso (7.64 US cents)==== per liter, which amounts to approximately ==== of their pre-tax average price. The tax on beverages excludes any drinks without sugar added, like fruit juices. Additionally, the reform stipulated an ==== ad-valorem tax on solid foods with a caloric density greater than or equal to 275 kilocalories per 100 g, exempting basic staples (====), which include high caloric products such as sugar, bread, tortillas, rice, beans, and cooking oil. The taxes are relatively high (about three times the average state-level soda tax in the U.S.), apply to thousands of products, and are national. After the reform, IEPS tax collection increased by ==== from 2013 to 2014.====Several papers (Allcott et al., 2019a, Gertler et al., 2021) argue that these taxes can be appropriate if consumers are misinformed or have self-control problems. Nonetheless, we still are short on evidence on how they impact the consumption of nutrients, especially in developing countries. Early studies correlated prices and quantities with no causal empirical design and found a wide range of estimates (Andreyeva et al., 2010). Others estimated demand systems, which could account for substitution patterns arising from household preferences (Dubois et al., 2014, Harding and Lovenheim, 2017, Finkelstein et al., 2013) but did not study a tax actually implemented, and instead relied on simulation —with little role for the supply side.====Cawley et al. (2019) review the existing studies that quantify the effectiveness of taxes on sugary drinks in a variety of settings and finds a wide range of potential impacts, both on prices (pass-through ranges from 50 to 100 percent) and consumption.==== Some papers conclude that while successful at reducing the consumption of taxed goods, the introduction of taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages has not translated into large changes in the intake of calories and sugar, due to substitution patterns (e.g. Restrepo and Cantor (2020), Fletcher et al. (2010)). Allcott et al. (2019b) also highlight the importance of understanding substitution patterns for optimal tax design.====Our paper focuses on how substitution worked against the tax's intended effects of reducing calorie and sugar consumption to fight obesity. The fact that Mexico introduced the tax on sugar-sweetened beverages together with a tax on high caloric foods, and that it excluded a large segment of high caloric products, makes it a particularly interesting setting to study substitution patterns. It is interesting to delve deeper into its impact on nutrients given that it is often cited as a success to fight obesity. We document that its effects are much more modest.====Using weekly scanner data information gathered from the purchases of 8,130 households and an event study design we find a ==== increase in prices and a ==== decrease in the purchase of calories from taxed drinks (TD) as a result of the tax reform. Similarly, we estimate a ==== increase in prices and a ==== decrease in the purchase of calories from taxed foods (TFs). Importantly, there was substantial substitution towards untaxed goods: when we sum calories from all categories in our dataset (taxed and untaxed), we find a small and statistically insignificant ==== reduction in the purchase of ==== calories (==== calories per week per household). Increased calorie consumption in the non-taxed drinks (NTD) category compensates for ==== of the decrease of TD calorie consumption, while substitution to non-taxed foods (NTF) calories more than compensates the decrease in calories in TFs by about ====. While we do not find an effect on total calories, we do find statistically significant increases in purchased cholesterol (====), sodium (====), saturated fat (====), carbohydrates (====), and protein (====).====Further exploring substitution mechanisms, we find that the tax reform design also implied changes in relative prices inside both the TD and TF categories, leading to different substitution patterns ==== these groups. Within TD, barcodes with higher caloric content saw larger price increases thus creating incentives to reduce the consumption of such high caloric content products. However, the opposite was true for TF: the ad-valorem tax on high caloric foods generated greater price increases for barcodes with fewer calories shifting relative prices in favor of goods with ==== calories within the TF group.====Previous papers have analyzed the impact of the Mexican tax reform. Grogger (2017) finds that the tax generated more than proportional increases in prices of taxed drinks, and a smaller increase in prices of non-taxed drinks, which he interprets as evidence of substitution towards untaxed drinks. In an often cited paper, Colchero et al. (2016) investigate the impact of the same tax, but with important limitations. First, they study the volume purchase of taxed and untaxed drinks only, overseeing the food categories. Ignoring the tax on food could bias their estimated effect, as this other major tax occurred simultaneously. Also, the omission of food categories overlooks the potential impacts due to substitution across categories. This omission is serious, as we find that once we take substitution into account the tax did not decrease total calories consumed. Second, they do not measure the purchase of calories or nutrients, which is what ultimately we care about around obesity: volumes of liquid are not the same as calories. Finally, they use a before/after design that linearly extrapolates the growth rates from 2012–2013 trends, which is more problematic the further in the future they extrapolate. Batis et al. (2016) study the taxes’ impact on kilos of food purchased, but neither of these studies measure the impact of the tax on total consumption and total nutrients, which is critically important for assessing the success of the tax. We show that failing to take substitution into account leads to wrong conclusions about the effectiveness of the tax.====Our paper contributes to the literature in the Mexican tax in at least two respects. First, it estimates causal impacts on consumption of sugary drink rigorously within a causal empirical framework. Second, we focus on a broader consumption basket, rather than just taxed products. We contribute to the broader international literature by (a) estimating the effects of the taxes on a large battery of nutrients, including sugar, fats, sodium, cholesterol, among others; (b) by documenting not only substitution across taxed and non-taxed drinks and food categories, but also within taxed categories; and (c) by estimating the effects of a nationwide tax, which by its nature limits geographical substitution found in some of the cited papers.====The paper has two main weaknesses. First, the event-study methodology we use is suitable for estimating the short run effects of the taxes, not the long run effects. We show however that there is no trend break in the growth of consumption of taxed drinks before and after the tax, and provide a causal estimate of the tax 1 year after the tax using a synthetic control methodology, reaching a similar conclusion. Some papers have shown that short term responses are larger than longer-term ones (Hut and Oster, 2018), but others have argued that dietary changes may take long (Hut, 2020, Gertler et al., 2021). Second, while we exploit a dataset that includes thousands of products, we do not observe all purchases. To mend this we show our dataset does capture a large share of packaged products, and that using total national production when possible —instead of supermarket purchases— results in similar estimates.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 reviews the obesity outlook in Mexico and provides details on the taxes we evaluate. Section 3 describes our data sources. Section 4 outlines our empirical strategy. Section 5 presents the main results, while Section 6 adds robustness checks.

We find that TOPP led to large and statistically significant increases in the use of long-acting reversible ","Despite being on a downward trend since the early 1990s, the teen birth rate continues to be higher in the United States than in other developed nations, including Canada and the United Kingdom (Martin et al., 2018; Kearney and Levine, 2015). Further, the rate of repeat pregnancy among teens remains high. Around one-third of recently pregnant adolescents experience a repeat pregnancy within two years of a previous birth or abortion, and the majority of these pregnancies are unintended with about half ending in births (Baldwin and Edelman, 2013). Second and higher-order births to teenage mothers make up a significant proportion of all teen births; one in six births to teens were repeat births in 2015 (Dee et al., 2017). The facts that (1) the majority of teen births – whether first or second order – are unintended, (2) children born to teen mothers tend to be at an economic and social disadvantage in early life (Kearney and Levine, 2012), and (3) teen childbearing imposes substantial costs on families, communities and public assistance programs, suggest broad scope for intervention. Addressing high pregnancy and repeat pregnancy rates among adolescents in the United States hence remains an important public health priority.==== However, few policies have had substantial effects on teen pregnancy (Kearney and Levine, 2015).====Inconsistent or incorrect use of effective contraceptive methods is a common factor in explaining unintended pregnancy among sexually active teens (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2012; Frost and Darroch, 2008; Vaughan et al., 2008). Most family-planning experts, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2012), now propose long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs)—which include intrauterine devices (IUDs) and subdermal implants—as first-line contraceptive options for teens due to their high efficacy, limited room for user error, and high continuation and satisfaction rates (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2012). Unlike most other forms of birth control, LARCs are substantially less subject to behavioral biases that could impede effective use of short-acting contraceptives. For example, condom use is subject to hot state/cold state biases; strong present bias may lead to discontinuation of the pill; inattention could lead to forgetting to take the pill or adhere regularly to the patch (Ashton et al., 2015). However, despite being the most effective type of reversible birth control, uptake of LARCs among teens is low, due to reasons including high up-front costs, lack of access, limited awareness, misinformation, or provider reluctance (Romero et al., 2015). Increasing access and exposure to LARC methods may therefore be instrumental in preventing unwanted pregnancies. A first pregnancy and the postpartum period during which a teen tends to be more actively engaged in the health system could be a valuable opportunity and particularly impactful time to promote effective contraception and prevent future unintended pregnancies.====In this paper, we present findings from an experimental evaluation of the Teen Options to Prevent Pregnancy (TOPP) program, an 18-month intervention that aims to reduce rapid repeat pregnancy among adolescent mothers who recently gave birth. The program comprises a unique combination of personalized contraceptive counseling delivered by nurse educators, facilitated access to contraceptive services, and referrals to social support services. The first component involves personalized contraceptive counseling using motivational interviewing techniques. Motivational interviewing is an individualized, client-centered, collaborative style of communication and counseling designed to promote behavior change by focusing on a person’s goals and motivation to change, emphasizing self-efficacy, and the relationship between current behaviors and future goals (Hettema et al., 2005). In the context of TOPP, nurse educators used motivational interviewing to gather information about participants’ past experiences with and beliefs about contraception and pregnancy, provide individualized education about birth spacing and contraceptive methods based on participants’ preferences and interests, and help guide participants toward birth control methods of their choice, and support participants in adhering to a birth control plan. When an adolescent declined to pursue any form of birth control, the nurse educator was instructed to respect that decision and refrain from pushing the participant towards contraception. To address potential logistical barriers in accessing birth control, the TOPP program offered a free van service for participants (and their babies) who need transportation to and from clinic appointments. In addition, TOPP provided participants direct access to contraceptive services through a program clinic, where a clinician was available to prescribe a wide array of birth control methods. Finally, to address other barriers to adopting and adhering to an effective birth control regimen, such as maternal depression, domestic violence, poverty, and unstable housing, the program gave participants access to a social worker who, after an initial risk assessment, referred them to appropriate support services, including mental health care, employment services, and child care services.====We found that TOPP led to substantial increases in LARC use and subsequently large reductions in repeat pregnancy. At the end of the 18-month intervention, 41.1 percent of treatment group participants reported using a LARC method in the past 3 months, relative to 25.7 percent of women in the control group. There were no significant changes in the use of other types of contraceptives at the extensive margin, including short-acting hormonal or barrier methods, or in sexual activity. Further, the program led to a large, statistically significant reduction in repeat pregnancy. At the end of the intervention, 20.8 percent of treatment group members reported a repeat pregnancy, compared with 38.2 percent of control group members. We did not find negative spillover effects of TOPP on other sexual risk behaviors. For example, the number of sexual partners remained similar between the treatment and control groups, and the rate of unprotected sex without a condom was in fact lower among treatment group members compared with control group members.====A back-of-the-envelope decomposition implies that the increase in LARC use can explain at most one-third of the reduction in repeat pregnancy, suggesting that other mechanisms are at play. The reduction in repeat pregnancy was also observed among women who did not adopt LARCs. We conduct an exploratory analysis to further shed light on the potential pathways through which the program affected repeat pregnancy. Because the intervention included several bundled components and service take-up was voluntary, it is challenging to determine the contribution of each intervention component. Nonetheless, our analysis suggests that direct access to contraceptive services, specifically the TOPP clinic where treatment group participants could receive a large array of birth control methods, played an important role in increasing LARC uptake and reducing repeat pregnancy. Among women who did not adopt LARCs, we find evidence of more consistent use of short-term hormonal methods, which suggests improved adherence to birth control was another mechanism through which the impacts were achieved. We find limited evidence that access to the program social worker played an important role in achieving the effects on the targeted outcomes. However, this is perhaps unsurprising since access to the social worker was a relatively minor component of the program.====Since having an unintended pregnancy may serve as a barrier to young women to further their education or attain economic self-sufficiency, we also examine other policy-relevant outcomes, including educational attainment, benefit receipt, and other indicators of well-being. These outcomes are important for furthering our understanding of the economic benefits of TOPP, and may also shed light on the broader benefits of increasing contraceptive access. We did not find statistically significant differences in school enrollment, high school completion, college attendance rates between the treatment and control groups. We also did not observe any impacts on benefit receipt, insurance coverage, financial hardship, or housing instability. However, it is possible that potential effects on these outcomes take longer than 18-months to manifest.====Finally, we present findings from a subgroup analysis to understand whether the program yielded more benefits for certain populations than others. Overall, the subgroup analysis suggests that there could be nontrivial variation in underlying preferences and attitudes toward contraceptive and fertility behaviors, which in turn influence the extent to which the program achieved its goals. For example, TOPP led to larger increases in LARC use among black participants compared to non-black participants, and among mothers who were 18 or older at baseline, compared to those who were younger than 18. Relatedly, there appeared to be larger impacts on the contraceptive use behavior and pregnancy outcomes of mothers who reported intending to avoid a repeat pregnancy in the next year and a half, and mothers who were recruited while pregnant versus those who were recruited after they had given birth.====Our results demonstrate that contraceptive counseling and reducing barriers to highly effective contraceptive methods, such as LARCs, could help reduce rates of unintended and rapid repeat pregnancy. Our findings are also consistent with a growing body of research highlighting LARC promotion as an effective method to reduce unintended teen pregnancies and births (Lindo and Packham, 2017), although our analysis also suggests that the uptake in LARCs is not the sole driving factor. Among studies that used a rigorous evaluation design, TOPP is one of the few interventions that has demonstrated success in reducing teen pregnancy (Lugo-Gil et al., 2018). We provide a comparison of TOPP with related programs in Sections 2.3 and 10.====The rest of this paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we provide additional background information on TOPP and compares TOPP with existing programs. Section 3 discusses how TOPP could influence the fertility decisions of participants in the context of the economic literature. Section 4 describes the study design. Section 5 presents an overview of the data, methods, and baseline characteristics of participants. In Section 6, we report our key findings. Section 7 presents the exploratory analysis of the pathways through which the program achieved its results. In Section 8, we report findings from a subgroup analysis, where we considered the impacts of TOPP for certain subgroups of interest. In Section 9, we discuss the cost-effectiveness of TOPP.

Drawing on the finding that financial subsidies have changed behaviour in other health contexts, we conducted a clustered randomised trial in 160 villages in Lao PDR to evaluate the effectiveness of combining financial incentives with Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS), a widely-conducted behaviour change program. Villages were randomly allocated to four groups, all of which received CLTS but differed in the type of subsidy offered (none, household, village or both). Using data from a random sample of households with young children and village administrative data, we show that household incentives increased sanitation take-up among the poor, whereas a village incentive increased take-up primarily among the non-poor. Improved sanitation produced positive health ==== - a 10 percentage point increase in village sanitation coverage decreased the probability of childhood stunting by 3 percentage points.","Inadequate water supply, water quality, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) continue to plague the developing world, both in urban and rural settings. As of 2015, 2.3 billion people lacked even basic sanitation services, with 860 million using unimproved facilities and another 890 million practicing open defecation (WHO/UNICEF JMP, 2019). The direct global health burden of inadequate WASH is estimated to be over 840,000 annual deaths from diarrheal illness (Prüss-Ustün et al., 2014).====Developing country governments have been trying to increase sanitation coverage for decades, with little success. Early attempts often involved the free or subsidised provision of sanitation hardware. This was widely found to be ineffective as households demand for sanitation was low and facilities went unused and were not maintained. As a result, free or subsidised sanitation gave way to programs that seek to generate demand for sanitation through behaviour change interventions. The program that is the focus of this paper – Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) – is one such example that is currently being implemented in approximately 60 countries. While they are popular and there is evidence of their ability to stimulate demand, these programs have had limited success in increasing poorer household’s access to sanitation, and so fail to generate high levels of community sanitation coverage (Cameron et al., 2019). The most straightforward way to address these limitations would be to subsidise toilet construction, possibly targeting the poorer households in a given community. Studies in other health contexts suggest that well-designed subsidisation of health investments can be effective – for example, see Meredith et al. (2013) on investment in rubber shoes as a way of avoiding helminth infections and Cohen and Dupas (2010) on insecticide-treated bed nets for malaria avoidance. Financial incentives alongside demand generation may thus be effective.====In this paper we evaluate the impact of CLTS alongside financial incentives using a cluster randomised controlled trial of government-implemented CLTS across 160 villages in southern Lao PDR. We compare three treatment arms – one in which poorer households are offered sanitation rebates; a second in which the village as a whole receives a financial reward for becoming open defecation free, and a third in which both village and household incentives are offered – with a control arm that offers standard CLTS with no financial incentives. This allows us to address our first research question: can financial incentives, offered to households and/or villages, increase toilet ownership over CLTS alone?====We build on the work of Guiteras et al. (2015) who examined the role of consumer subsidies employed alongside an NGO-implemented CLTS program in Bangladesh. They show that alongside CLTS, the provision of large subsidies (approximately 75% of the cost of hygienic toilet) to poorer households resulted in large increases in toilet construction.==== We examine household investment in improved sanitation in response to much smaller subsidies, in the context of a large, government-run sanitation program.====We also examine the health impacts of improved sanitation in terms of children’s growth and the magnitude of health spillovers. Considerable uncertainty remains about the ability of sanitation interventions to reduce disease and child growth faltering. Three recent large randomised evaluations of household WASH and nutrition interventions did not find evidence of disruption of faecal-oral pathogen transmission sufficient to generate child linear growth benefits, though one trial detected significant protection against child diarrhoea (Pickering et al., 2019; Null et al., 2018; Luby et al., 2018). However, the interventions studied were household-focused and did not aim at community sanitation coverage. It may be that health and growth gains only occur once a sufficient proportion of households in a community have access to sanitation.====Although health spillovers (also referred to as externalities, herd protection or indirect effects) are of significant interest to both economists and public health researchers (see Benjamin-Chung et al., 2015), surprisingly few studies have examined their importance in the context of WASH. Of the few studies, most are observational and there is no consensus on the form of the relationship between improvements in sanitation and health outcomes (Kresch et al., 2020).==== Spears (2019) presents evidence of a nonlinear relationship between open defecation density and average child height-for-age using African and Indian Demographic Health Survey data, finding the relationship to be slightly convex in Africa and slightly concave in India.

This paradoxical result seems more likely when consumption is persistent and with aggregate data. Using both simulated and real data, we show that the milk addiction paradox disappears when estimating the data using an AR(1) linear specification that describes the saddle-path solution of the rational addiction model, instead of the canonical AR(2) model. The AR(1) specification is able to correctly discriminate between rational addiction and simple persistence in the data, to test for the main features of rational addiction, and to produce unbiased estimates of the short and long-run elasticity of demand. These results hold both with individual and aggregated data, and they imply that the AR(1) model is a better empirical alternative for testing rational addiction than the canonical AR(2) model.","The milk addiction paradox refers to the surprising finding that the consumption of milk appears to be addictive when estimated using the empirical model of rational addiction of Becker et al., 1990, Becker et al., 1994. The spurious evidence on milk addiction seems to be more likely when the data are aggregated and serially correlated, two common features of time series (Auld and Grootendorst, 2004). The milk addiction paradox, and the additional observation that the canonical AR(2) addiction model features an explosive root (Laporte et al., 2017), has had wide resonance in the literature, and it has raised the question of whether the rational addiction model can be estimated altogether.====In this paper we provide a positive answer, and we show that the rational addiction theory can indeed be tested, provided one considers the AR(1) addiction model derived in Dragone and Raggi (2018), instead of the canonical AR(2) specification. Using both simulated and real data, we show that the AR(1) model is able to correctly discriminate rational addiction from simple persistence in the data. Moreover, it produces unbiased estimates of the short and long-run elasticity of demand. These results hold both with individual and aggregated data, and they are robust to the possible endogeneity of prices and of lagged consumption. They are likely due to the fact that the AR(1) model is stationary (while the AR(2) model is explosive) and that it does not suffer of the endogeneity concerns that arise when including lead consumption in the estimating equation.====To introduce the reader to the theoretical background, in Section 2 we present the rational addition model and the two specifications used in the empirical literature: the AR(1) equation describing the saddle path solution of the model (Dragone and Raggi, 2018), and the AR(2) equation describing the corresponding Euler equation (Becker et al., 1990, Becker et al., 1994). While the former only includes lagged consumption in the estimating equation, the latter, which is the canonical specification used in the empirical literature, includes both lead and lagged consumption terms (Becker et al., 1990, Becker et al., 1994, Chaloupka, 1991, Chaloupka, 1996, Grossman and Chaloupka, 1998, Chaloupka and Warner, 2000, Cawley and Ruhm, 2012).====In Section 3 we test the performance of the AR(1) addiction model through a battery of Monte Carlo experiments. We first generate trajectories that feature no addiction by construction, then we estimate the corresponding parameters using the AR(1) addiction model. The results correctly show that the simulated trajectories are not consistent with rational addiction, that there is no tendency of the AR(1) addiction model to detect addiction when there is just spurious correlation in the data, and that the corresponding estimates of the short and long-run elasticity of demand are unbiased. As a validation exercise, we also check whether the AR(1) is able to correctly detect rational addiction when, in fact, the simulated consumption trajectories do feature rational addiction. As shown in Laporte et al. (2017), an analog exercise can produce unreliable estimates if one generates and estimates addiction trajectories using the canonical AR(2) model. On the contrary, when using the AR(1) model we find that the results are reliable and unbiased.====Notably, all results hold irrespective of whether we consider individual or aggregate consumption data, a reassuring finding that mitigates the concerns raised by Auld and Grootendorst (2004) about testing rational addiction with aggregate data. To further explore the sensitivity of the AR(1) model, and to address some endogeneity concerns that have been raised in the literature, Section 4 performs two additional sets of experiments as robustness checks. In the first set, we generate price trajectories that have both an exogenous and an endogenous component. In the second set of experiments, lagged consumption is explicitly considered to be endogenous. In the literature these endogeneity concerns have been addressed using further leads and lags of prices, or taxes, as instruments (see, for example, Chaloupka, 1991, Becker et al., 1994, Gruber and Köszegi, 2001, Baltagi and Geishecker, 2006). We proceed along the same lines and find that the IV estimates are still unbiased (although, as expected, the IV estimates are less efficient). We conclude that the AR(1) correctly discriminates between persistence and rational addiction, and that aggregation, endogeneity of prices and endogeneity of lagged consumption pose no significant threat to testing the theory of rational addiction.====In Section 5 we extend the analysis to real data, and we estimate the demand for milk, oranges, eggs and cigarettes using the same Canadian dataset analyzed in Auld and Grootendorst (2004). Instead of using the canonical AR(2) model, however, we estimate the AR(1) addiction equation. This allows to directly address the milk addiction paradox, and to compare the performance of the AR(1) addiction model with the results of Auld and Grootendorst (2004). Our results show no evidence of milk being rationally addictive, and they allow us to conclude that the milk addiction paradox is an artifact of using the Euler equation rather than the AR(1) solution of the model. In fact, in our estimations the consumption of milk, oranges and eggs is not consistent with the theory of rational addiction, while smoking, as expected, is rationally addictive.

In this paper, we present the results of a ","One fourth of all deaths in the United States are attributable to conditions that could be prevented with healthier habits (García, 2016, CDC, 2016). Unfortunately, existing interventions have been largely unsuccessful at fostering these lifelong behavioral improvements. Incentives are frequently employed to stimulate healthier habits (e.g. Acland and Levy, 2015, Loewenstein et al., 2016, Carrera et al., 2018), but even when they are found to initiate healthier behaviors, the behavioral changes rarely persist after incentives are withdrawn and therefore, questions remain about the necessary conditions for habit formation (Wood and Neal, 2016). In this study, we identify a behavioral strategy that is associated with persistently high antiretroviral (ARV) medication adherence after controlling for observable individual-level characteristics and the receipt of incentives. Our evidence supports the conceptualization of habits as contextually cued behaviors, and challenges theories of habit formation in the economics and psychology literatures. We present empirical evidence that context matters for developing persistent habits, and incentivizing the performance of a healthier behavior in response to a consistent contextual cue is a promising approach for promoting healthier habits.====This study focuses on promoting consistently high medication adherence, which is necessary for reducing the burden of chronic diseases on health and economic outcomes across the world (Polonsky and Henry, 2016, Linnemayr, 2017, Abegaz et al., 2017, Dunn et al., 2018). Medication nonadherence among people living with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is particularly harmful because high rates of adherence to ARV medications reduces the likelihood of HIV viral transmission, and thus represents an important step in ending the global HIV epidemic (Abrams and Strasser, 2015, Harries et al., 2016). In Uganda, an increase in the availability of free ARV medications has reduced many of the common structural barriers to ARV adherence, but achieving and maintaining high rates of adherence is still hindered by cognitive barriers commonly observed among all populations, such as present-biased time preferences and declining intrinsic motivation (Linnemayr and Stecher, 2015, Czaicki et al., 2018, Dilorio et al., 2008). Interventions addressing these psychological barriers are greatly needed to improve medication adherence and reduce the associated healthcare costs for a wide range of chronic health conditions that similarly require consistently high treatment adherence (Cutler et al., 2018).====Incentives have been suggested as a method for combating several of the common cognitive barriers to performing healthier behaviors, but there is mixed evidence for their effectiveness (Rosen et al., 2007, Sorensen et al., 2007, Simoni et al., 2008, Vrijens et al., 2008, Asch et al., 2015, Thirumurthy et al., 2019a, Thirumurthy et al., 2019b). In response to this conflicting evidence, recent studies have focused on ways to optimize intervention design parameters for a specific behavioral setting (Thirumurthy et al., 2019a). However, even when incentives are successfully designed for a targeted health behavior and lead to behavioral improvements, few studies have found that incentives lead to persistent, healthier behaviors after incentives are withdrawn (Acland and Levy, 2015, Royer et al., 2015, Rohde and Verbeke, 2017, Carrera et al., 2018). The prevailing economic theory of habit formation, which began with Pollak (1970) and Ryder and Heal's (1973) habit stock model,==== cannot explain the lack of behavioral persistence after incentives are withdrawn (Mantzari et al., 2015), which suggests that alternative behavioral mechanisms may underly many habitual behaviors.====The psychology literature offers two alternative behavioral theories to explain the lack of behavioral persistence from the use of incentives. First, Self-Determination Theory posits that extrinsic rewards such as incentives will reduce, or “crowd-out,” intrinsic motivation (Deci et al., 1999, Deci and Ryan, 2000, Ryan and Deci, 2000). This detrimental effect on motivation may explain the lack of behavioral persistence observed in incentive-based interventions since psychologists have also proposed that behavior change will lead to habit formation only when people are sufficiently motivated and prepared to make a change (Ajzen, 1985). A separate psychological theory defines habits as “context-behavior associations” (Wood and Rünger, 2016, Wood, 2017). According to this theory, “habits are automatic behavioral responses to contextual cues … developed through repetition of behavior in consistent contexts” (Wood and Neal, 2007, Lally and Gardner, 2013, Verplanken et al., 2018). Since extant research has yet to design incentives that also reinforce contextual consistency for a targeted behavior, this theory offers a second explanation for why incentives have not successfully created persistent, healthier habits and suggests ways of designing more effective incentive-based interventions.====This paper examines both the immediate and persistent effects of using incentives to improve ARV medication adherence among HIV-infected patients in Uganda, and provides preliminary evidence in support of contextual cue-based intervention methods for successfully creating persistent medication adherence habits. By observing ARV medication adherence behavior during both the 20-month incentives-based intervention and 6-month post-incentivization period, a longer period than many incentive-based studies,==== we were able to study the impact of incentives on habit formation more thoroughly than much of the existing behavior change research. In addition, we collected measures of participants’ present-biasedness and intrinsic motivation during the intervention which allowed us to compare the explanatory power of the behavioral economic model of intertemporal choice and alternative psychological theories of habit formation on participants’ observed behavior during and after the intervention. We additionally constructed a novel measure of temporally consistent daily pill-taking based on the observed timing of participants’ daily pill-taking, calculated as the fraction of pills taken close to each participants’ typical pill-taking time. We then combined this measure with survey data to identify participants who successfully used a contextual cue for their ARV adherence, and examined the association between using time-based pill-taking cues and participants’ post-incentives ARV adherence as well as the interaction between using time-based cues and the treatment effects over the 20-month intervention.====Our intervention was implemented among a sample of 155 adult clients of the Mildmay HIV Clinic in Kampala, Uganda who were randomly assigned to either receive incentives conditional on observable medication adherence behaviors, or to a control group. Importantly, incentive for medication adherence were not conditioned on the daily timing of pill-taking but were received for successfully taking the prescribed daily ARV medications at any point between 12:00 am and 11:59 pm. Small in-kind incentives were awarded through a lottery mechanism at each clinic visit, which were pre-scheduled at 3-month intervals for a 20-month period, resulting in roughly 7 potential prize drawings per participant during the intervention. This lottery format and the nonmonetary, in-kind prizes were informed by extensive formative research among the client population, and all participants (including the control group) were also provided the usual standard of care at the Mildmay clinic which includes medication adherence support and free ARV medications.====Our study reveals that carefully selected incentive parameters can produce significant improvements to short-term medication adherence but that persistent, long-term behavioral changes are likely to occur only for the participants with a contextually-cued daily medication routine, which supports the theory of context-dependent behavioral associations as an underlying mechanism of habit formation in this setting. Specifically, the results show that directly incentivizing ARV adherence increased mean adherence by 5.4 percentage points relative to the control group over the 20-month incentivization period. This increase manifested as soon as incentives were offered and there was no statistically significant relationship between present-biased time preferences and adherence during or after incentivization, which cannot be explained by the standard economic theories of habit formation and intertemporal choice. Counter to Self-Determination Theory, we also found that intrinsic motivation increased during the incentivization period, which we explore further in the discussion section. Importantly, intervention effects persisted after incentives were withdrawn only for the participants who used time-based contextual cues for their daily ARV medication pill-taking. Mean adherence declined among all participants by 3.4 p.p. during the 6 months after incentives were withdrawn except among the participants that successfully used time-based adherence cues, such as taking ARV medications after a television show or morning prayers, and this difference remained even after conditioning on observable participant-level characteristics and study group assignment. Finally, heterogenous treatment effect analyses revealed that using time-based cues was associated with 19.5 p.p. higher ARV adherence throughout the 20-month intervention and that our incentives were primarily effective at improving adherence among those who did not use time-based cues, but it is unknown what caused participants, all of whom had documented or self-reported adherence problems, to adopt this behavioral strategy during the intervention. The success of time-based pill-taking routines supports the role of contextual cues for maintaining habitual behaviors, and suggests that future interventions should explore incentivizing the use of contextual cues for establishing persistent, healthier habits.====Our research offers four contributions to the behavior change literature. First, the results show that carefully designed intervention parameters can produce short-term improvements in medication adherence behavior and suggest how incentives may be successfully tailored to improve other health behaviors. Second, we are able to examine whether short-term improvements in medication adherence behavior become persistent behavioral habits by measuring medication adherence during the 6-months after incentives were withdrawn. This stands in stark contrast to existing studies that either do not observe behaviors after incentives are withdrawn or do not find significant predictors of behavioral persistence. Third, we collected measures of participants’ time preferences and intrinsic motivation throughout the intervention which allowed us to test alternative theories of habit formation; neither the accumulation of a habit stock of medication adherence behavior nor declining intrinsic motivation can explain the observed changes in ARV medication adherence behavior during this intervention. The final contribution of this research is the use of detailed contextual information to support the characterization of habits as context-behavior associations. Specifically, taking medications in response to a time-based contextual cue during the intervention strongly predicts persistent medication adherence after incentives are withdrawn.====This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes competing theories of habit formation from the economics and psychology literatures and the testable predictions from these theories for study participants’ observed ARV medication adherence behavior. Section 3 outlines the intervention setting and design, and presents sample descriptive statistics. Section 4 contains the paper's main analytical results, and the concluding section of this paper discusses how these results inform the design of future incentive-based interventions for establishing healthier habits as well as this study's limitations.",Uncovering a behavioral strategy for establishing new habits: Evidence from incentives for medication adherence in Uganda,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016762962100028X,16 March 2021,2021,Research Article,160.0

It directly influences the probability of hospital stays, which account for a large share of total healthcare spending.====Both ED utilization and admissions through the ED exhibit large variation over time and across space, and the sources of that variation remain unclear. To better understand this variation, it is important to acknowledge the interrelated nature of patients’ decisions to visit the ED and emergency physicians’ decisions as to which ED patients to admit. Either of these margins may exhibit regional variation. The decision to visit the ED for urgent care may be influenced by place-specific factors, such as distance to the nearest ED and the presence of nearby urgent care centers and retail clinics (Alexander et al., 2019, Allen et al., 2019). The decision to admit patients from the ED may be influenced by place-specific factors, such as the distribution of cases arriving at the ED, hospital diagnostic quality, capacity, and incentives for filling unoccupied beds. Both decisions may also be driven by patient-specific factors, such as preferences for walk-in care over scheduled care and population morbidity that affects the need for urgent and emergent care. Patient-specific factors generally correspond to what we think of as “demand” and place-specific factors to what we think of as “supply.”====In this paper, we analyze the relative importance of supply- and demand-side factors in driving ED use and ED admission decisions. Separating demand and supply factors is an important first step for both understanding the nature of the variation in such use and for assessing the need for and potential impact of policies aimed at changing the variation.====To implement this exercise, we study the response to changes in ED access using two complementary empirical approaches. Our primary approach uses the variation in ED utilization across space. To separate the variation in ED utilization that is due to place-specific factors from variation due to patient-specific factors, we use within-patient variation in ED utilization as patients move, arguably for non-healthcare reasons, across regions that vary in their access to EDs.==== In a secondary approach, we use an event-study design, which takes advantage of the entry of a new hospital (and thus a new ED) into a large market, thus increasing ED access sharply over time.====We implement our empirical strategy using detailed and comprehensive longitudinal medical data from about half of the Israeli population. The data come from Clalit Health Services, the largest of four Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) in Israel that provide universal, standardized, tax-funded health insurance to all residents. We study migration across Israel's nine districts, which are geographic units comparable to US counties, with an average population of about one million residents per district and a fairly wide range of annual ED use rates (the share of covered individuals who visit the ED in a given year), ranging from 20% to over 30%. ED visits account directly for 3% of all healthcare spending, and indirectly, as a portal for unplanned admission, for more than a quarter of total spending. Our main sample consists of all 150,000 adult beneficiaries (aged 25 and older) who moved across districts between 2011 and 2017.====The use of the Israeli setting is quite attractive for this purpose. While health insurance coverage broadly resembles that of Medicare in the United States, annual churn rates are lower than 1%, so we can track the entire enrollee population over many years, with minimal attrition. Moreover, Clalit provides uniform coverage and fairly homogeneous clinics across the country, so health insurance coverage does not change when patients move, and unobservable provider characteristics are less likely to drive the nature of variation across districts. Finally, movers in our sample are relatively young, thus mitigating concerns that may arise with an older population (e.g., Medicare) that moves might be driven by changes in health status.====Moving across districts is disruptive and likely affects short-run patterns of healthcare utilization. For this reason, as is now standard in the literature, our primary empirical strategy does not compare movers to non-movers but instead relies on estimating the extent to which the change in movers’ ED use around the time of a move correlates with the destination-origin difference in ED use. Intuitively, if all ED use is driven by place-specific factors, we expect it to be perfectly correlated with this difference. Conversely, if it is entirely driven by individual demand, we expect this correlation to be zero. Because we observe both moves from high to low ED-use areas and vice versa, we can separately and flexibly control for trends in ED utilization that are common to all movers and thus account for any disruption associated with the move itself.====Our main results reveal that the destination district's ED use rate has an important impact on the change in ED utilization of the mover. After moving to a district with an annual ED use rate that is one percentage point higher (lower) than the origin district, movers are about half a percentage point more (less) likely to visit the ED per year. Remarkably, all of the correlation between an individual ED use rate and the origin-destination difference in average ED use rates is concentrated in ED visits that did not result in admission to the hospital. In contrast, for visits that resulted in an admission, we find no correlation between individual rates and the destination-origin difference in ED utilization rate.====Taken together, the results suggest that at least half of the geographic variation in ED use is attributable to supply-side factors, but that such factors influence only cases that are discharged home, which are likely less severe. Conversely, the entire variation in ED visits that result in a subsequent hospital admission is attributable to demand-side factors. Using data on non-ED healthcare utilization, we present additional evidence consistent with the fact that these incremental low-severity ED visits are associated with a reduction in the utilization of other, presumably substitutable healthcare services.====We exploit the fact that in the Israeli context we observe comprehensive data on the affiliation of patients and providers, as well as detailed data on patients, to document that distance from the patient's “home clinic” to the nearest hospital and the propensity of primary care providers to refer patients to the ED are important channels that drive our main results. Both channels change upon a move, and (as we show) impact mainly outpatient ED use: patients living (or moving) closer to a hospital, or those with (or switching to) a high-propensity-to-refer physician are more likely to visit the ED, but not more likely to be admitted from the ED.====In a complementary approach, we exploit a distinctly different, albeit imperfect source of variation in ED access: the impact on ED use and admissions that results from the opening of a new general hospital in a previously under-served city. Like patient migration, hospital entry also leads to a sharp change in supply-side factors because it significantly reduces the distance and travel time to the nearest ED for the “treated” population of nearby residents (while also improving access to other inpatient services). We use a difference-in-differences framework to account for potential time trends by comparing outcomes of the treated population against outcomes of “untreated” patients residing in similar cities that did not experience a change in ED availability. Conforming with our earlier results, we find that an ED opening that occurs when a general hospital enters a local market results in a sharp increase in the monthly probability of an ED visit of nearby residents compared to residents of comparable cities. Furthermore, once again, the increase in ED use following the supply-side change is entirely concentrated in visits that do not result in hospital admission.====Taken together, the results consistently suggest that supply-side variation in ED access affects only the less severe ED cases—for which alternative settings might be a good substitute—but not the more severe cases that result in an admission.==== In contrast, our finding that the entire effect is driven by ED visits that are less severe suggests that prior evidence of large variations in admissions through the ED may reflect mostly demand-side, not supply-side, factors. Specifically, our evidence militates against explanations of variation in ED admissions in terms of factors that vary geographically. In particular, the findings do not fit with the idea that the mere decision to visit the ED is an important driver of inpatient hospital utilization rates and the findings do not lend support to the idea that admission decisions (from the ED) depend on hospital differences in available capacity, diagnostic quality, or financial incentives.====A large body of existing work has documented substantial variation in ED use and admissions, both across and within countries. For example, Shoff et al. (2018) find that the ED admission rate of Medicare beneficiaries in 2012 varied tremendously across US counties; Abualenain et al. (2013) and Sabbatini et al. (2014) document large variation in hospital-level admission rates; Dawson et al. (2008) document variation across Canadian provinces; and Van Parys (2016) documents variation in admission rates among ED physicians in Florida. By separating supply- and demand-side factors, our analysis extends our understanding of the potential nature of this variation. Indeed, in the concluding section, we discuss the potential policy implications of our results.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 presents our data source and setting. Section 3 presents our main sample and empirical strategy using patient migration. Section 4 presents our main results decomposing ED utilization rates to place and person effects, and Section 5 explores some channels that drive these results.

However, such services may reduce the costs, and thus increase the frequency and intensity, of drinking activity. To examine whether ridesharing affects alcohol consumption, we leverage spatial and temporal variation in the presence of Uber's taxi-like service, UberX, across the United States. Using self-reported measures of alcohol consumption in the past 30 days among individuals aged 21 to 64, we find that UberX is associated with a 3.6% increase in number of drinks per drinking day, a 2.7% increase in drinking days, a 5.4% increase in total drinks, a 4.3% increase in the maximum number of drinks in a single occasion, and a 1.3% increase in those who report drinking any alcohol. For certain groups, such as males, individuals aged 21–34, and students, UberX is associated with even larger increases in drinking. For example, among those aged 21–34, total drinks increase by 7.4% and ==== instances increase by 9.5%. We also find that the marginal impact of Uber on drinking is larger in areas that have weaker public transit. Using administrative employment data, we find that some of the additional alcohol consumption is occurring at bars. Specifically, we estimate that UberX is associated with a 3.5% increase in employment and a 3.7% increase in total earnings among workers at NAICS-designated “drinking places”.","Ridesharing services such as Uber and Lyft reduce transportation costs by allowing individuals to seamlessly transmit or receive ride requests, share location and contact information, and exchange payment using only their smartphones. By allowing riders and drivers to rate each other, these services also incorporate reputation as a mechanism to maintain service quality. For these reasons, many individuals consider ridesharing a more convenient, better quality, and lower cost option than traditional taxi services.====In addition to the private benefits, Uber and Lyft highlight that their services can reduce alcohol-related social harms, including instances of drunk driving. For example, a 2015 report by Uber notes that “[d]runk driving is a scourge on our society” and that it “wrecks lives, shatters families and puts communities and innocent bystanders at risk.”==== In the same report, Uber finds that entry into Seattle coincided with a 10% decrease in driving under the influence (DUI) arrests, and that peak Uber use is correlated with bar closing times in Miami, Pittsburgh, and Chicago. Some studies support Uber's claims (Greenwood and Wattal, 2017, Martin-Buck, 2017, Peck, 2017, Dills and Mulholland, 2018), but the literature is not unanimous (Brazil and Kirk, 2016, Barrios et al., 2020a).====Notably, in their examination of the relationship between Uber, drunk driving, and crime, Dills and Mulholland (2018) suggest that “[ridesharing's] ease of use might also increase alcohol consumption and other risky behavior.” Jackson and Owens (2011) make a similar argument in their study of D.C. Metro expansions from 1999 to 2003, where they find a 5.4% increase in alcohol-related arrests around bars near stations that experienced expanded late night service. Their findings suggest that, to the extent that safe transportation and alcohol are complementary, demand for alcohol will increase when ridesharing becomes available. A ridesharing “Peltzman effect” may also cause additional alcohol consumption, where individuals compensate for the reduction in risks associated with intoxicated driving by drinking more (Peltzman, 1975).====To examine whether ridesharing is associated with an increase in the frequency and intensity of alcohol consumption, we estimate the impact of UberX presence on survey respondents’ reported alcohol consumption in the past 30 days using 2009 to 2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Selected Metropolitan/Micropolitan Area Risk Trends (BRFSS SMART) data. UberX is the company's taxi-like service, which is more prevalent and affordable than their luxury services such as Uber Black.==== We employ a differences-in-differences empirical strategy that leverages spatial and temporal variation in the presence of UberX across U.S. Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas (MMSAs), where we define our treatment variable as the proportion of the year that UberX is present in a respondent's MMSA.====In our preferred specification, we use a differences-in-differences design with two-way fixed effects, individual-level controls, and area-level controls. Focusing on those aged 21 to 64, we find that UberX is associated with a 3.6% increase in the average number of drinks per drinking day, a 2.7% increase in drinking days, and a 5.4% increase in total drinks. A 5.4% increase in the total number of drinks per month corresponds to more than 580,000 additional drinks per MMSA-month.==== We also find a 4.3% increase in the maximum number of drinks in a single drinking occasion and a 0.8 percentage point (1.33%) increase in the number of people who report any alcohol consumption over the previous 30 days. Finally, we find that UberX is associated with a 5.1% increase in binge drinking instances, though this is not statistically significant at conventional levels (====).====Looking at particular groups of respondents, our estimates suggest that Uber's impact is larger among individuals aged 21–34, including a 7.4% increase in total drinks, a 9.5% increase in binge drinking instances, and a 1.5 percentage point (2.3%) increase in the number who report any alcohol consumption in the past 30 days. Further, we find that UberX does not appear to increase drinking among those aged 65 or older. The pattern of findings by age supports a causal interpretation of our central differences-in-differences estimates for two reasons. First, our summary statistics show that younger individuals drink more, implying that their alcohol consumption may be more constrained by the absence of safe transit options. Second, accessing ridesharing requires a smartphone, and younger individuals have adopted and adapted to smartphone technology more quickly.====Next, we examine how Uber's impact relates to the quality of existing transit options. In particular, Hall et al. (2018) show that Uber substitutes for public transportation in areas with stronger transit systems, suggesting that we might expect Uber to have a smaller impact on drinking in such areas. To test this idea, we group areas into quartiles according to their AllTransit Transit Connectivity Index (TCI) values and then estimate the effects of UberX on alcohol consumption by TCI quartile.==== Indeed, we find that the effects on drinking are larger in areas where transit is weaker, which reinforces the idea that Uber is facilitating away-from-home alcohol consumption.====To examine whether any of the additional alcohol consumption occurs in bars when UberX is present, we use administrative data on employment and earnings from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) for NAICS-designated drinking places (NAICS 7224–10).==== Focusing on earnings and employment at drinking places is useful because greater spending drives increases in labor demand and earnings via proportional tips. Our estimates imply that Uber is associated with a 3.5% increase in per-capita employment and a 3.7% increase in per-capita total employee earnings at drinking places. To the extent that individuals are less likely to engage in heavy drinking at restaurants, even if safe and reliable transportation is available, we estimate employment and earnings effects at full-service restaurants (NAICS 7225-11) as a quasi-placebo analysis.==== As expected, we find a smaller 1.2% increase in employment and no statistically significant effect on total employee earnings at full-service restaurants. In contrast, if our main findings were driven by unobserved shocks to disposable income such that general demand for leisure and entertainment increases, we would expect to see comparable increases in earnings and employment at both bars and restaurants.====Formally, our BRFSS and QCEW estimates can be interpreted as causal as long as any omitted idiosyncratic shocks are not correlated with both Uber's presence and our measures of drinking activity. We examine the validity of our identifying assumption and the robustness of our findings in several distinct ways. First, while our main estimation sample consists only of ever-treated areas, we also show that including never-treated areas yields almost identical estimates. Second, using an event study approach, we find a lack of differential pre-trends in the outcomes of interest leading up to UberX entry. Third, we show that trends in drinking in the pre-UberX years (2009 to 2012) do not predict eventual UberX entry timing. Fourth, we show that our central estimates change very little when controlling for time-varying location-level demographics and location-specific linear time trends.====Finally, we examine whether Uber affects self-reported health outcomes among BRFSS respondents, including general health, mental health, and smoking. While we find little to no evidence that UberX affects these outcomes, there is perhaps some suggestive evidence of negative mental health effects. That said, we note that all of our health outcome estimates should be interpreted with caution, as increased alcohol consumption is not the only mechanism through which UberX may affect health. For example, Moskatel and Slusky (2019) find that UberX is a substitute for ambulance rides, illustrating that ridesharing might improve access to health services. For these reasons, we present our analyses of the self-reported health effects of Uber in Appendix B.====Overall, our paper makes three key contributions. First, we provide direct evidence on the relationship between ridesharing and alcohol consumption, which complements concurrent work by Zhou (2020) on the same topic.==== Second, to the extent that ridesharing may induce additional alcohol consumption among both riders and non-riders, we show in Section 2 that our findings may help explain the mixed evidence on the relationship between ridesharing and drunk driving as highlighted by Barrios et al. (2020a). Third, our work documents the existence of a new quasi-experimental setting that researchers may be able to leverage to study the individual and social impacts of increased alcohol consumption.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we expand on the relationships between ridesharing, alcohol consumption, and social harms. In Section 3, we describe our data. In Section 4, we develop our approach to estimation and identification. In Section 5, we present our main findings, robustness checks, and heterogeneity analyses.

Our supplementary analyses point to stronger bargaining leverage and foreclosure of rival hospitals as potential mechanisms for the estimated price effects.,"Roughly one out of every six dollars in the U.S. economy flows to the healthcare sector—a sector that is currently grappling with the causes and consequences of greater consolidation both horizontally and vertically (Kocher and Sahni, 2011, Dafny, 2014, Gaynor et al., 2015). While much of the academic literature focuses on the effects of hospital mergers or system-joiners (i.e., horizontal integration),==== vertically integrated hospital-physician systems have become commonplace.==== For example, recent research shows that health system ownership of physician practices in the U.S. more than tripled from 2009 to 2015 and now affects roughly a quarter of all physician practices (Richards et al., 2016). Contemporary health policies, such as the introduction of Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs), are also believed to further encourage vertical integration and alter the nature of healthcare competition going forward (Auerbach et al., 2013, Frech et al., 2015, Richards et al., 2017). Motivated by these empirical trends and current policy changes, our focus in this paper concerns the effects of increased vertical integration between hospitals and physicians on hospital pricing.====From the hospital's perspective, momentum toward greater vertical integration is theoretically motivated by two potentially overlapping strategies, both of which offer different predictions for hospital prices (Ciliberto and Dranove, 2006, Cuellar and Gertler, 2006, Gaynor, 2006, Post et al., 2018). First, an efficiency motive suggests that hospitals and physicians may formally align in order to generate efficiency gains from economies of scope, improved coordination, or reduced agency problems encountered in the production of healthcare. For example, a vertically integrated system may be able to more efficiently manage complicated patients across intersecting service lines (Stensland and Stinson, 2002, Kocher and Sahni, 2011, Casalino et al., 2013, Lammers and Eric., 2013). This form of improved coordination is sometimes referred to as clinical integration (Burns and Pauly, 2002, Burns and Muller, 2008). The key assumption is that, in the absence of integration, quality and efficiency of care suffer due to the otherwise fragmented flow of information and misaligned provider incentives (Cebul et al., 2008, McWilliams, 2016, Agha et al., 2017). Thus, efforts to reduce such fragmentation should ultimately improve quality and/or lower the costs of care provision—perhaps lowering service prices as well.====Alternatively, vertical integration may proceed with little or no impact on clinical integration and simply serve to confer market power.==== Mechanisms underlying an increase in market power include additional bargaining leverage with commercial insurers (Horn and Wolinsky, 1988, Gal-Or, 1999, Vistnes and Sarafidis, 2013, Peters, 2014), increased patient or physician loyalty (Baker et al., 2014, Baker et al., 2016), and foreclosure (Hart et al., 1990, Ordover et al., 1990, Bernheim and Whinston, 1998, Gaynor and Vogt, 2000). All of these mechanisms can translate physician-hospital integration into higher hospital prices (Gaynor and Vogt, 2000, Gaynor and Town, 2012a).====With theoretically ambiguous (and possibly divergent) effects of vertical integration on hospital behavior and pricing, understanding the influence of physician-hospital vertical integration on healthcare markets becomes an empirical matter. Some earlier studies, such as Cuellar and Gertler (2006) and Ciliberto and Dranove (2006), focused on initial waves of integration that occurred in the 1990s and relied on hospital self-reported indicators to measure vertical integration. However, more recent data suggest that the ongoing trend in physician-hospital integration is more aggressive compared to previous waves, introducing the potential for larger and more far-reaching effects on hospital pricing. In addition, the recent wave of integration may be spurred in part by the need for hospitals to reduce costs and improve care coordination as part of the incentives introduced under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).==== Many of these ACA policies expand the scope of a hospital's “product,” beyond that of a standard inpatient stay, and encourage hospitals to more closely manage the care delivery process and improve efficiency. Indeed, two recent papers by Dranove and Ody (2019) and Capps et al. (2018) find that the recent wave of integration is partly driven by a change in Medicare's reimbursement rules and that integration leads to a large increase in physician prices. Whether and to what extent ==== prices are affected in the wake of the recent wave of physician-hospital integration remains an open question.====In this paper, we assemble a unique combination of data to investigate the effect of contemporary (2009–2015) vertical integration between hospitals and physicians on U.S. hospital pricing and other related outcomes. Our analysis extends the existing literature in four important ways. First, the aggressiveness in which hospitals have acquired physician practices in recent years offers new opportunities to examine the effect of physician-hospital integration in the modern healthcare environment. Second, our combined data provide an improved measure of vertical integration compared to the common measures of alignment using a hospital's self-reported classification.==== Third, our study is national in scope while existing work is often limited to a single state or region. And last, we employ a hospital-level measure of prices rather than average market-level prices as in Baker et al. (2014) and Neprash et al. (2015). Each of these analytic features complements and adds to prior work in this research area.====Across our different identification strategies, we find a robust 3–5% increase in hospital prices following vertical integration with local physician practices. There is little indication that hospital quality is commensurately higher, consistent with findings from Koch et al. (2018) in a study of vertical integration and quality of care for the Medicare fee-for-service population. We also find that increased prices could not be explained by changes in patient mix. Our results therefore suggest enhanced market power for integrated hospitals, and we find supporting evidence that is consistent with the bargaining leverage and foreclosure mechanisms. Taken together, our findings encourage greater scrutiny of increased physician-hospital integration by antitrust authorities.",Hospital Pricing Following Integration with Physician Practices,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629621000291,8 March 2021,2021,Research Article,163.0

We generate empirical predictions by incorporating time pressure into a model of physician behavior by ====. We use data from the ","Primary care is the point of first contact for many patients and is where many initial diagnosis and treatment decisions are made. Understanding the productivity of primary care providers (PCPs) is therefore important for health economics and policy, but is complicated by the fact that PCPs deliver care in a multitasking work setting (Holmstrom and Milgrom, 1991; Ma, 1994). PCP productivity encompasses both the quantity of care delivered (i.e., the number of patients and the number of health conditions covered per patient visit) and the quality of care that is delivered, often along multiple dimensions that are difficult for patients and payers to observe. The structure of the PCP work setting ostensibly influences productivity. This structure includes incentives for delivering both quantity and quality of services, along with any constraints on PCP behavior and decision-making. One potentially important constraint is time. Half of physicians report time pressure during office visits and that their work pace is chaotic (Linzer, 2009). Inadequate time for primary care visits may reduce the opportunity for thorough examination, diagnosis, communication, and shared decision making between the PCP and the patient – potentially leading to poorer quality of care and less-favorable health outcomes (Christianson et al., 2012; Powell et al., 2013; Linzer et al., 2015; Koven, 2016).====Surveys that solicited physicians’ perceptions of causes of overuse of unnecessary treatment – one type of poor quality of care – corroborate the potential importance of time pressure. Significant pluralities of respondents indicated that inadequate time with patients led to more unnecessary care or not enough time to discuss risks and benefits of unnecessary care (Sirovich et al., 2011; The ABIM Foundation, 2014; Sears et al., 2016). One survey also asked about potential solutions for overuse, and 78 % of physicians indicated that more time with patients to discuss alternatives would be at least somewhat effective (The ABIM Foundation, 2014). Another recent survey found that 37 % of physicians believe that inadequate time with patients is a top reason for overutilization (Lyu et al., 2017).====The goal of this paper is to understand if time pressure faced by PCPs causally affects the productivity of PCPs within a visit, both in terms of quantity and quality, using a unique data source and empirical research design. We examine several dimensions of productivity, including the number of topics covered per visit measured by number of diagnoses, the likelihood that patients have return visits that are either planned (i.e., recommended by the PCP) or unplanned, and whether patients have subsequent hospital visits. We also analyze use of low-value services, a potentially inappropriate service that may substitute for higher-quality though time-consuming patient engagement (opioid prescribing), and high-value preventive care services.====We use data from the electronic health records (EHR) of a large health care delivery system in a major U.S. metropolitan area, and we use unexpected changes to a PCP’s schedule as a source of random variation in time pressure. Our empirical specifications include PCP fixed effects and other fixed effects to control for seasonality, time of day, and day of week that determine expected variation in schedule changes. As we discuss in more detail below, schedule changes in the clinics we study are implemented in ways that are not driven by PCP preferences or characteristics of other scheduled visits that day.====We find that increased time pressure reduces the number of diagnoses recorded in a visit, which suggests providers facing time pressure engage in fewer topics with their patients. Moving from the first to the fourth quartile of our measure of time pressure reduces the number of diagnoses by 1.8 %. Visits in the fourth quartile of time pressure experience 6 % more planned and 4.5 % more unplanned follow-up visits, suggesting that providers delay care to a future visit and that patients experience adverse events or dissatisfaction with care when provided under time pressure. We also find evidence that more time pressure increases the likelihood of subsequent hospitalization (4.1 % increase from the first to the fourth quartile), which may also signal poor quality primary care. We find some evidence that more time pressure affects low-value care, reduces opioid prescribing, and reduces recommended preventive care.====Understanding the causal effect of time pressure on the quality of care delivered in primary care settings is important for several reasons. The majority of health care visits in the U.S. are with PCPs, which include physicians and other clinicians like physician assistants (PAs) and nurse practitioners (NPs) (Bodenheimer and Pham, 2010). PCPs play many key roles including making initial diagnoses, managing chronic diseases, and making treatment decisions that include prescribing, ordering tests, and referring to specialists. If more time pressure reduces quality of care in primary care, then providers, payers, and policymakers face a trade-off. From a provider perspective, reducing time pressure within visits comes at a cost of fewer visits per shift (and less fee-for-service revenue) or of investments in additional personnel to allow providers to work more efficiently. If the effect of time pressure on quality of care is negative and clinically meaningful, then practices might take this tradeoff seriously. From the perspective of payers and policymakers, whether time pressure affects quality and value of care has important implications for designing payment contracts in a multitasking environment (Ma, 1994; Ma and McGuire, 1997). If additional time in a primary care visit significantly improves the quality of care, then changing fees to encourage longer visits on the margins might be a worthwhile investment. However, these implications only apply if time pressure indeed causally affects quality of care. While we do find a number of statistically significant effects of time pressure, the magnitudes of these effects are for the most part relatively small. This is consistent with other concurrent research on the effects of time constraints on primary care provider behavior (Shurtz et al., 2019), and suggests that the tradeoffs from having more time pressure in primary care may not be considerably consequential for the outcomes we examine.",Docs with their eyes on the clock?

With state-dependent utility, consumers may decline actuarially fair insurance if the probability of becoming ill exceeds a threshold. In markets with adverse selection, a positive genetic test may cause all or some high risks to drop out of the market (complete and partial genetic discrimination, respectively). Full participation in the market by all consumers requires cross-subsidization. We show that the ","The Human Genome Project and the subsequent development of predictive genetic tests created widespread concerns about the possibility of genetic discrimination. Genetic discrimination is defined as “… discrimination against an individual or against members of that individual's family solely because of real or perceived differences from the ""normal"" genome of that individual.” (Billings et al., 1992, p. 447). In particular, genetic discrimination refers to the treatment of asymptomatic individuals and can arise either as the result of genetic tests or family history. A positive genetic test or other adverse genetic information may result in higher premiums, possibly making insurance expensive enough to deter those affected from obtaining coverage. A positive test for a genetic disorder implies a greater health risk and a greater financial risk arising from health care costs and other consequences of the disease. The cost of insurance is an important issue among those concerned with genetic discrimination.====What advocates for those with various genetic conditions view as genetic discrimination, insurers view as actuarially sound risk classification intended to ensure individuals pay a premium commensurate with their risk. The inability to classify based on risk-relevant information can lead to adverse selection. The potential for adverse selection is an important concern among those concerned with the efficiency of insurance markets. The interplay between adverse selection and genetic discrimination has been a focus of much of the received literature.====The purpose of this paper is to examine public policy toward the use of genetic information by insurers when a positive genetic test may make insurance too expensive for consumers.==== Our focus is the value of information and social welfare. We first examine a model in which two conditions hold: (1) everyone that has a positive test result views treatment to be too costly without insurance and (2) high risks never buy insurance at actuarially fair rates. This is referred to as complete genetic discrimination. Our analysis assumes a perfectly competitive market except for the presence of asymmetric information. We consider five different public policies toward the use of genetic testing to cover the policies currently in use and analyze the private value of obtaining a genetic test and social welfare attained under each. These policies are mandatory testing (MT), duty to disclose (DD), voluntary disclosure or consent law (CL), information ban (IB), and code of conduct (CC). Our objective is to rank the policy regimes.====First, we analyze the mandatory testing (MT) regime where insurers require test results as a condition of insurance. In the U.S., the life insurance, disability insurance, long-term care insurance and annuity markets are typically unregulated. This allows for mandatory testing, where insurers could in principle require genetic tests. Similarly, most African and Asian countries have not passed legislation governing the use of genetic information. Under mandatory testing, informational asymmetries are eliminated. The previous literature has generally ignored this policy alternative.==== Low risks obtain full, actuarially fair coverage and high risks choose to remain uninsured in our complete genetic discrimination case.====We next examine the duty to disclose (DD) regime where insurers may not require testing but must be provided the results of any tests that are taken.==== While Canadian insurers do not require genetic tests, they may request the results of any tests that have been taken; the situation is similar in New Zealand and Australia. The first paper to address the duty to disclose in an insurance setting with exogenous risk and endogenous information is Crocker and Snow (1992). They find that because insurers can condition policy offerings on test results, individuals face a lottery over premiums (classification risk) which makes the value of information negative to risk averse individuals. Our results differ from theirs in that the value of information under duty to disclose can be either negative or positive due to the fact that informed high risks can obtain higher utility than is possible in their model by choosing to remain uninsured. Unlike Crocker and Snow and the current paper, additional studies considering the duty to disclose (Doherty and Posey, 1998; Barigozzi and Henriet., 2011; Bardey and De Donder, 2013; Peter et al., 2017) have focused on a setting where preventive care can be undertaken once risk type is known. They find that the value of information under duty to disclose can be either positive or negative because of a trade-off between prevention and classification risk. In all of these papers, the duty to disclose at least weakly Pareto dominates all other regimes considered. While it has been shown that in the presence of preventive action the duty to disclose does not always Pareto dominate all other regimes, we find that this is the case in the absence of preventive action under complete genetic discrimination.====Under the voluntary disclosure or consent law (CL) policy, individuals may choose whether or not to disclose test results to the insurer. In the U.K., insurers have agreed not to use genetic tests (except for life insurance policies over £500,000), however, individuals are allowed to provide favorable genetic test results. We find that under complete genetic discrimination, the consent law and mandatory testing yield identical outcomes.==== These outcomes will also be identical to the outcome under duty to disclose if that regime has a positive value of information. An important argument against the mandatory testing regime and the duty to disclose is their coercive nature. In contrast, the consent law does not appear to be coercive – individuals may choose whether or not to be tested, choose whether or not to reveal the test results, and untested individuals are not denied coverage. A consent law might be a more politically palatable way of achieving the same outcome as mandatory testing and, potentially, the duty to disclose.====Next, we examine an information ban (IB) regime under which insurers are not allowed to use any genetic information. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 and the Genetic Information and Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) of 2008 together effectively prohibit the use of genetic information (including family health history) in underwriting in both group and individual health insurance in the U.S. for asymptomatic individuals. Most European countries ban the use of genetic information through the Oviedo Convention and through national legislation. These policies generally were implemented with a focus on privacy concerns and overall concerns about genetic discrimination. The prior research has found that the information ban is Pareto dominated by all other policy regimes (see Doherty and Thistle, 1996, for the case with exogenous risk types and Barigozzi and Henriet., 2011 for the case with prevention). Yet this approach has been widely implemented. We find that under complete genetic discrimination, when the proportion of high risks is small, the information ban is Pareto noncomparable to either mandatory testing or the consent law.====Finally, under a code of conduct (CC) insurers may not require tests. Individuals must reveal that they have been tested, but not their test results. This policy is used in South Africa. We are the first to consider the code of conduct in a model without prevention. Peter, Richter and Thistle (2017) find that the value of information is indeterminate in the case with prevention and that the code of conduct is Pareto noncomparable to the consent law, is dominated by the duty to disclose and dominates the information ban. We find that the value of information is always negative under complete genetic discrimination so that policyholders choose to remain uninformed. The code of conduct is strictly Pareto dominated by the duty to disclose only when the value of information under duty to disclose is positive.====We know that, in practice, individuals vary in their willingness to pay for insurance, and some individuals who have positive test results will buy insurance despite the high premium. Therefore, we extend the model to consider insurance markets in which some individuals, including some informed high risks, would always be willing to pay out of pocket to obtain treatment and always buy insurance at actuarially fair rates. These individuals are sometimes referred to as “standard” individuals below. We call this case partial genetic discrimination – only some individuals may decide that insurance is “too expensive.” Under the MT policy regime, standard individuals are tested and obtain full coverage under partial genetic discrimination. For the other individuals, the outcomes are unchanged relative to complete genetic discrimination - low risk individuals obtain full coverage while high risk individuals drop out the market. We find that some of the regimes are Pareto noncomparable to duty to disclose under partial genetic discrimination, but the DD policy regime is never Pareto dominated. We again find that the MT and CL regimes lead to the same equilibrium outcomes and the same welfare as one another. Interestingly, under partial genetic discrimination the information ban is Pareto noncomparable to all other policies under certain parameter conditions. This is driven by both the subset of individuals who find treatment less valuable and the ability of insurers to cross-subsidize policyholders as outlined below. These results are the first to provide some theoretical support for the welfare implications of the widely used information ban policies. Finally, the CC regime is Pareto noncomparable to the IB regime under partial genetic discrimination when in equilibrium only low risks with low willingness to pay drop out of the market.====There are two major differences between our model and those employed in prior research on the private value of genetic information and public policy toward insurers’ use of that information. First, these papers assume that utility is non-state-dependent. State-dependent utility, introduced by Eisner and Strotz (1961), is now well established as a method of dealing with the fact that poor health status affects the marginal utility of consumption.==== An important implication of non-state-dependent utility is that individuals who have a positive genetic test will purchase insurance when it is fairly priced.==== In contrast, we assume state-dependent utility. Under state-dependent utility, some individuals may choose to forego treatment, particularly, if the difference in utility between the good and bad states is small. State-dependent utility also allows for genetic discrimination in the sense that at least some individuals who have positive genetic tests will decide that insurance is too expensive and will not purchase insurance.====We introduce a “pain tolerance” parameter in our model of state-dependent utility which captures the effect of ill health on utility. Individuals with high pain tolerance are less affected by the disease, and, ceteris paribus, have a lower willingness to pay for treatment and a lower willingness to pay for insurance. We show that there is a critical cutoff loss probability such that individuals will not buy insurance if their loss probability is above the cutoff. Much of our analysis is devoted to exploring the implications of this result. Under complete genetic discrimination, the loss probability for the high risks, but not the low risks, is above the cutoff. The case of partial genetic discrimination attempts to capture the fact that some individuals buy insurance even with a positive genetic test. We introduce a second group of individuals, otherwise identical to the first group, who have low pain tolerance. For this second group of individuals the loss probability for both high and low risks is below the cutoff probability. This group of low pain tolerance individuals always buys insurance, while the high pain tolerance individuals may or may not choose to be treated and may or may not buy insurance.====Second, much of the existing literature analyzes Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976) (RS) equilibria.==== This implicitly assumes that the population incidence of genetic disease is large enough that the RS equilibrium exists. However, the population incidence of many genetic conditions is very small and may not be large enough to support a RS equilibrium.==== In addition, the Rothschild-Stiglitz model makes the assumption that each insurer can offer only a single contract. This, along with the assumption of competitive markets leads to actuarially fair premiums in equilibrium. We relax the restrictive assumption on the proportion of high risks and extend our analysis beyond the RS model by allowing insurers to offer menus of contracts. Netzer and Scheuer (2014) develop a multistage game with menus of contracts whose subgame perfect Nash equilibrium coincides with the Wilson (1977); Miyazaki (1977); Spence (1978) (WMS) contracts. We adopt this model to analyze several public policy approaches to genetic information.==== This is important since active trade by some or all consumers may require cross-subsidization. This is also important since the equilibrium affects the welfare ranking of the policy alternatives.====The papers most closely related to ours are Strohmenger and Wambach (2000), and Posey and Thistle (2019). Strohmenger-Wambach assume state-dependent utility, and consider the case where the cost of treatment is less than the individual’s income but may be greater than their willingness-to-pay.==== They show this implies that if the high risks’ loss probability exceeds a critical level then the high risk individuals do not purchase insurance.==== We use a different formulation from Strohmenger-Wambach by including a “pain tolerance” parameter that allows for comparative statics analysis of the effect of the difference in utility between the good and bad states. We show that the critical probability at which individuals decline insurance depends on their pain tolerance and the magnitude of treatment costs. With full information, individuals with low pain tolerance always insure, while individuals with high pain tolerance may not. Whether high risk individuals buy insurance or not has implications for the performance of the insurance market. They consider the duty to disclose, where individuals are required to reveal whether they have been tested and the test result to the insurer, and the information ban, where insurers are prohibited from using any genetic information in pricing coverage, as the public policy alternatives. They provide an extensive analysis of different ways that market equilibria may break down when treatment costs exceed individuals’ willingness to pay for the two policy alternatives they consider. We focus on genetic discrimination but examine both complete and partial genetic discrimination and examine a wider set of alternative public policies and rank these policies in terms of their welfare outcomes.====Posey and Thistle (2019) analyze a model with non-state-dependent utility where losses are larger than wealth. They show that individuals with the option of declaring bankruptcy will not insure if the loss probability is above a threshold. In an insurance market with adverse selection, if the high risks’ loss probability is above the threshold, then no trade occurs at the Rothschild-Stiglitz equilibrium. Active trade in insurance requires cross-subsidization. When a subset of individuals with significant bankruptcy costs is included in the market, then the equilibrium outcome always involves positive levels of insurance coverage for some individuals, but the parameters of the model determine whether all types receive coverage, or whether null contracts are received by both high and low risks with no bankruptcy costs or just the low risks from that group. The model is analytically quite similar to the model analyzed here.==== The focus of that paper is on the characterization of equilibrium while the focus of this paper is on the value of information and the welfare implications of public policies on genetic testing.====In addition to the theoretical work on genetic testing policies, there is empirical work on the role of genetic information in adverse selection in insurance markets which relates to our research. Zick et al. (2005) and Taylor et al. (2010) find substantial increases in the ownership of long-term care insurance by individuals who have positive predictive tests for Alzheimer’s disease. Oster et al. (2010) report asymptomatic individuals who have tested positive for Huntington’s disease are five times more likely to own long-term care insurance than otherwise comparable individuals, which they interpret as “strong evidence of adverse selection” (p. 1048). In addition, several studies examine whether there exists adverse selection in health insurance markets, although they do not focus on the causes of asymmetric information which could include genetic tests, other medical tests, and personal and family history. These studies find evidence of risk–based adverse selection in the U.S. Medigap and non-group health insurance market (Finkelstein, 2004; Lo Sasso and Lurie, 2009), U.S. employer provided health insurance (Einav et al., 2010; Handel, 2013; Bajari et al., 2014), including small-, medium- and large-group markets (Bundorf et al., 2010), and the U.K. private health insurance market (Olivella and Vera-Hernández, 2013).====Other empirical studies focus on genetic discrimination directly. Billings et al. (1992) provide case studies of individuals reporting genetic discrimination in health, life, disability, mortgage and auto insurance. Surveys of genetic support groups in the U.S. and U.K. find that 22% of respondents in the U.S. had been denied health insurance coverage because of genetic status (Lapham et al., 1996), while 33% in the U.K. reported problems applying for life insurance, versus 5% for the control group (Low et al., 1998).==== Bombard et al. (2009, 2010, 2012) report fear of genetic discrimination in 75% of those at risk for Huntington’s disease, with 30% reporting actual discrimination in disability, life and mortgage insurance. On a cautionary note, Joly et al. (2013) point out serious methodological limitations of the existing studies of the life insurance market, including methodology that is not sufficiently robust, the small number of genetic conditions examined, the heterogeneity and small scope of existing studies, and small sample sizes. They note that, of 33 studies conducted in Australia, Canada, Europe, and the U.S., 14 studies report that genetic discrimination exists and is a concern while 19 studies find that either it does not exist or exists but is rare. In their survey of the literature, Otlowski et al. (2012) conclude that fear of genetic discrimination is more widespread than reported genetic discrimination. Nonetheless, they conclude (p. 437) that genetic discrimination “… is now an established, incontrovertible ethical, legal, and psychosocial phenomenon.”====The next section develops the basic model and considers the conditions under which a positive test result makes insurance “too expensive.” Section 3 analyzes the equilibrium value of information. We assume individuals have no prior information regarding their risk type.==== What information (tested/untested status and test results) is observed by insurers and can be used in underwriting is determined by the public policy regime in place. Section 4 compares the policy regimes under the assumption that there is complete genetic discrimination. Section 5 summarizes the results of the partial discrimination case, while the model is developed in detail in Appendix D.

However, price variation across payers is difficult to observe. We measure negotiated prices for hospital-payer pairs in Massachusetts and characterize price variation. Between-payer price variation is similar in magnitude to between-hospital price variation. Administrative-services-only contracts, in which insurers do not bear risk, have higher prices. We model negotiation incentives and show that contractual form and demand responsiveness to negotiated prices are important determinants of negotiated prices.","High health care costs are a major public policy concern. Higher quantities and prices both contribute to the United States’ uniquely high costs relative to other countries (Garber and Skinner, 2008, Cutler and Ly, 2011). Furthermore, price variation across settings, providers, and regions has received substantial media and policy attention. Prices for the same service vary substantially between geographic markets and between providers in a given geographic market (Cooper et al., 2019). While the recent literature has focused on between-provider variation, negotiated prices may vary across insurers as well. In this paper, we provide new descriptive evidence for the role of insurers and payers in setting negotiated prices. We explore the size of price variation between insurers, how contracting incentives affect these prices, and consequences for individuals and self-insured employers.====We document variation in prices paid to the same provider for the same service using data from the Massachusetts All-Payer Claims Database (APCD). We examine negotiated payments for five well-defined services (knee and hip replacements, vaginal and cesarean deliveries, and MRIs), in addition to overall price levels for all inpatient care. Between-payer price variation is similar in magnitude to between-provider price variation. Across our five clinical cohorts, the standard deviation in prices across hospitals, controlling for payer, ranges from 17–31 percent of the mean. In comparison, the standard deviation in prices across payers, controlling for hospitals, ranges from 16–28 percent of the mean. The most expensive major payer is about 13 percent more expensive on average than the cheapest major payer in our sample. For comparison, the highest-priced hospital system in our data is 27 percent more expensive than the average of other hospitals.====Examining variation in prices between ==== at the same provider largely eliminates quality differences as a potential explanation. Differences in bargaining between payers may reflect underlying differences in enrollees’ demand for providers across payers, the ability of payers to steer enrollees to specific hospitals, or bargaining ability. In our data, differences in underlying enrollee demand across payers are unlikely to explain price differences, as demographic characteristics (e.g., income) and distance to nearby hospitals are relatively balanced across payers. Finally, one might also be concerned that price differentials across payers could reflect differences in underlying severity and inputs used to treat patients. Examining MRI prices allows us to isolate a homogeneous procedure where even the “chargemaster” rate (list price) is largely the same across payers within a provider.====Variation in negotiated provider prices is important for at least two distinct reasons. First, consumers bear part of those costs in the form of out-of-pocket spending. Second, higher provider prices translate into higher costs for self-insured employers and, potentially, higher insurance premiums in the fully-insured market. While price transparency efforts have focused on helping consumers compare prices between providers before obtaining care, the earlier choice of which insurer to buy from will also have important effects on the health care prices consumers face. All else equal, consumers should prefer plans offered by insurers with lower negotiated rates. This is particularly true as the popularity of high-deductible insurance plans grows. Moreover, because self-insured employers pay medical costs directly at the prices their insurer (henceforth “payer”) negotiates, they should prefer lower negotiated provider prices in administrative services only (ASO) contracts.====Choosing a low price instead of a high price major payer (about a 15 percent difference in negotiated prices) leads to an average out-of-pocket (OOP) savings of $182 in a high-deductible plan; an individual with more knowledge about the types of service and hospitals they would experience greater price variation. The cost reduction for self-insured employers is larger: $750–$1000 per enrollee.====Given the importance of between-payer variation, we explore strategic payer behavior. The existing literature suggests that payers will receive lower prices if they have larger market share or greater ability to steer patients to specific providers (Sorensen, 2003, Roberts et al., 2017, and Ho and Lee, 2017).==== Our theory shows that—in addition to these forces—the response of insurance demand to negotiated prices is a crucial determinant of negotiated price levels; to our knowledge, this parameter has not been measured. Contracting incentives are also important. In a fully-insured product, the payer bears most of the costs of higher negotiated prices; in an ASO contract, the payer typically receives a fixed fee and the self-insured employer bears the costs of higher negotiated prices. All else equal, we predict that payers will negotiate less aggressively when they are not financially responsible for the claim; in the data, negotiated prices at a given hospital are higher in ASO contracts (by about 2–4 percent), holding payer constant. Consistent with previous studies, we also find that managed care (HMO) plans command prices that are 3–5 percent lower, holding payer constant.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes relevant features of the insurer market and related literature. Section 3 describes our data and estimation strategy.

We calibrate the model with U.S. data for an average American in the year 2012 and estimate that time-inconsistent health behavior causes a loss of about 4 years of life. We show how price policy can nudge individuals to behave more healthy such that they actually realize the longevity and value of life planned at age 20.,"The way individuals discount future payoffs matters for all intertemporal decisions. It is also of particular relevance for health behavior, which frequently has short-term costs and long-term benefits (Fuchs, 1982). It has been argued that individuals who discount the future heavily are more likely to be obese (e.g. Komlos et al., 2004), to smoke (e.g. Scharff and Viscusi, 2011), and to perform fewer health maintenance activities (Bradford, 2010); for surveys, see Lawless et al. (2013) and Bradford et al. (2014). Beyond the magnitude of discounting as such (measuring the degree of impatience), health behavior and health outcomes may also be affected by the method of discounting (measuring the degree of present bias). While most of the conventional literature on intertemporal choice assumes a constant discount rate, behavioral and experimental economists strongly argue that actual behavior is better described by declining discount rates (Frederick et al., 2002; and DellaVigna, 2009), also known as (quasi-) hyperbolic discounting.====Hyperbolic discounting affects (health-) decision making through two different channels, present bias and time-inconsistency, which are not always properly distinguished. While it is frequently assumed that hyperbolic discounting necessarily involves time-inconsistent decision making (see e.g. Angeletos et al., 2001., p.53; Cawley and Ruhm, 2012, Cawley and Ruhm, 2012, p. 139), it is possible to propose empirically plausible forms of hyperbolic discounting that support time-consistent decisions (Burness, 1976, Drouhin, 2009). Strulik and Trimborn (2018) investigated time-consistent hyperbolic discounting in a life cycle model with endogenous health and longevity and found that it promotes health investments and induces less unhealthy consumption. This is so because declining discount rates put relatively more weight on utility in old age and thus motivate investments in a long life. Strulik and Trimborn (2018) conclude that these results may explain the sometimes inconclusive findings of studies on the impact of hyperbolic discounting on health behavior (e.g. Khwaja et al., 2007, Story et al., 2014). Observing declining discount rates is not sufficient for the identification of a time-inconsistency issue. The inference of time-inconsistency needs longitudinal studies where individuals solve intertemporal decision problems repeatedly and are found to systematically deviate from their announced plans.====Here, we present the complementing study to Strulik and Trimborn (2018). We investigate health behavior and health outcomes when hyperbolic discounting causes time-inconsistent decisions. Given that time-inconsistency is the usually assumed consequence of hyperbolic discounting and given the abundance of empirical studies on discounting in the health domain, it is perhaps surprising that a rigorous theoretical analysis of this problem has not been provided so far. As rigorous we consider a model setup acknowledging that health behavior affects longevity and that this fact is taken into account in individual decision making. With respect to smoking for example, individuals are assumed to know that smoking reduces health and longevity (Strulik, 2018). In fact, the desire for a long life may be the main motivation to reduce or quit smoking and the life-shortening consequences may be the main reason why hyperbolically discounting individuals consider it a failure when they do not stick to their original plans to reduce or to quit smoking.====The literature distinguishes naive and sophisticated behavior in problems of hyperbolic discounting (Laibson, 1996, Laibson, 1998). Naive behavior describes the open-loop solution in which individuals are not aware of the potential time-inconsistency of their plans, while sophisticated behavior realizes the time-inconsistency problem and achieves consistent decisions by imposing feedback (or Markovian-) solution strategies (Barro, 1999). The achievement of time-consistency, however, comes at a cost since the Markovian solution is generally not pareto-optimal. Since the goal of our study is to assess the effects of time-inconsistent decisions on health behavior and health outcomes we focus on the (naive) open-loop solution. Empirically, naive behavior is observed when individuals systematically reject their plans for the future, such as their new year's resolutions, and regret past behavior. From a policy perspective, it is the time-inconsistency of decisions that makes the problem interesting because inconsistent individuals would benefit in terms of welfare and value of life from policy interventions.====Problems of sophisticated behavior are usually difficult to solve. Solutions available in the literature usually inspect the first order conditions at the steady state, which is approached as time goes to infinity. A major innovation of our paper is that we investigate hyperbolic discounting when the length of life is finite, endogenous, and dependent on health behavior. When the time horizon is endogenous, the discussion of an asymptotic steady state is not an option. Formally, the transversality conditions when the time horizon is finite and endogenous differ from those for an infinite time horizon. We are not aware of any study that obtains feedback solutions for such free terminal time problems. However, feedback strategies in hyperbolic discounting problems are similar to other approaches to time-consistent solutions of present-bias problems, namely Thaler and Shefrin's (1981) dual-self theory of limited self-control (see also Fudenberg and Levine, 2006) and Gul and Pesendorfer's (2001) temptation utility approach. Ruhm (2012) and Strulik, 2019a, Strulik, 2019b discuss health decision making under limited self-control and the dual-self assumption. A common feature of the sophisticated solution as well as of the dual-self and temptation approach is that there is no time-inconsistency in decision making. Individuals suffer in terms of utility from their present-bias but they do not make any mistakes in predicting their life-cycle behavior. For example, individuals will comply to their New Year's resolutions. Here we are interested in assessing the mistakes that originate from present-bias and their impact on health behavior and health outcomes and thus focus on the open-loop solution.====We implement hyperbolic discounting and time-inconsistent decisions in a gerontologically founded life cycle model with endogenous aging and longevity. Our framework is the Dalgaard and Strulik (2014) model of health deficit accumulation, which can be calibrated in a straightforward manner using the so-called frailty index. The frailty index counts the relative number of health deficits that an individual has out of a long list of potential deficits. As humans age, they accumulate health deficits in a quasi-exponential way (Mitnitski et al., 2002, Abeliansky and Strulik, 2018). Aging is thus understood as “the intrinsic, cumulative, progressive, and deleterious loss of function that eventually culminates in death” (Arking, 2006), a view that has a deep foundation in evolutionary biology (Fries, 1980, Gavrilov and Gavrilova, 1991). Individuals try to slow down aging and to prolong their life through health investments and restrained unhealthy consumption. In the present context, the calibration of the health deficit model enables a quantitative assessment of the health consequences of time-inconsistent decision making. In particular, we will compare the potential length of life when individuals could commit to their health (and savings) plans with the actually realized length of life after plan revisions. This leads to a quantitative assessment of the cost of time-inconsistency in terms of longevity.====Our paper is related to the seminal studies on hyperbolic discounting and unhealthy behavior by Gruber and Koeszegi (2001), Gruber and Koszegi (2004). With a focus on smoking and addiction, these studies provided important insights on time-inconsistent health decisions. From the viewpoint of health economics they are, however, not entirely convincing because the model is based on agents who ignore in their calculus that smoking reduces their life expectancy. An important refinement of the theory has been provided by Aronsson and Thunstrom (2008). They extend O’Donoghue and Rabin's (2006) approach to optimal sin taxes by acknowledging that past unhealthy consumption does not enter current utility directly but through its impact on health, which is a state variable. They show that the optimal policy needs to subsidize health directly and, in extension, another subsidy is needed to subsidize wealth, the second state variable in their model. This is so because all intertemporal choices are affected by time-inconsistent decisions. Generalizing, and applying Tinbergen's-rule, the policymaker needs one time-varying tax or subsidy for each state variable that humans face.====From a health economic perspective, however, the Aronsson and Thunstrom (2008) approach is still incomplete because it assumes an infinite planning horizon. Here, we assume that humans die neither at a pre-determined time nor live forever. Instead, longevity is endogenous and affected by health behavior. Therewith we acknowledge that the desire for a long life is a major motive to behave healthy and to make healthy life cycle plans for the future. Formally, the endogeneity of death entails a free terminal time problem, for which a transversality condition identifies the unique life cycle trajectory preferred at any age (i.e. at any planning time).==== By implementing the transversality condition we are able to identify the life-cycle paths that hyperbolically discounting individuals plan at any age as well as the actually realized path. We calibrate the model for an average 20-year-old American man who discounts future life cycle outcomes hyperbolically at an average rate of 7 percent and show that he greatly overestimates his life cycle health investments and underestimates his unhealthy consumption, conceptualized as smoking. In fact, the benchmark individual plans at any age to quickly reduce smoking and to increase health investments while he actually (mildly) increases smoking until age 60 and largely underinvests in health at any age.====The notion of endogenous longevity allows to provide a quantitative assessment of the impact of time-inconsistency on health outcomes. For the calibrated benchmark individual we predict that death strikes about 4 years earlier than expected at age 20. We meet the involved parameter uncertainty with a sensitivity analysis, which suggests an estimated loss of longevity between 3 and 9 years, compared to the original plan at age 20. Due to the involved computational difficulties the model is stylized in many ways. It is deterministic, neglects the built-up of addiction capital, and ignores many other aspects of health behavior like, for example, physical exercise. Rather than providing a complete description of human life and aging it provides a first positive theory of time-inconsistent health behavior that takes the endogeneity of health and longevity into account. Finally, we should clarify that our study does not contribute to the empirical question whether individuals discount hyperbolically and make inconsistent decisions. Instead, we extend research in a new direction. We assume hyperbolic discounting as our working hypothesis and fit the model parameters to calibrate observable health behavior and health outcomes. We then compute and compare actual and planned life cycle behavior and estimate the loss in terms of longevity and value of life that is entailed by time-inconsistent health plans.====The paper proceeds as follows. In the next section we set up the model. In Section 3 we explain the solution method and calibrate the model for an average American male (of 20 years of age in the year 2012). In Section 4 we provide the results on predicted life cycle plans, behavior, health outcomes and the impact of time-inconsistency on the value of life and longevity. In Section 5 we compare life cycle health behavior and outcomes of hyperbolically and exponentially discounting individuals.

One suggested explanation is differences in parental investments and health behavior. This paper addresses an important part of preventive health behavior by studying non-adherence in the free of charge and voluntary Danish Childhood Vaccination Program.====Non-adherence in vaccination programs in developed countries poses a major challenge for public health (Black and Rappuoli, 2010, Shetty, 2010) and scepticism concerning vaccinations is becoming more widespread although scientific evidence strongly documents the importance and safety of existing vaccinations (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1999, Offit et al., 2002, Elliman and Bedford, 2003, Stern and Markel, 2005). Thus, knowledge about the differential causes for vaccination non-adherence is of crucial importance in order to increase coverage rates and understand and mitigate inequalities in health behaviors.====This paper studies the effects of a reminder letter policy on subsequent vaccination behavior, sibling spill-overs and participation in other parts of the preventive care system beyond the vaccination program. To assess the driving forces of vaccination non-adherence, I propose a decomposition into shares of responsive, non-responsive and delaying parents based on their reaction to the reminder letter and provide a framework that links parental responses to the reminder letter to causes for non-adherence.====I exploit a national reform, which introduced a vaccination reminder letter policy on May 15, 2014, in a sharp Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) to estimate the causal effects of the policy. Parents with a child registered as lacking at least one scheduled vaccination at age 2 receive a reminder letter. The letter only informs parents that their child has not received all recommended vaccinations and highlights that vaccinations are voluntary. I provide evidence for the validity of the design by showing that a wide range of pre-determined covariates are well-balanced and that there is no bunching across the cut-off. Moreover, the results are robust to bandwidth selection, estimation method and pass various placebo tests.====I find that the reminder letter policy increases adherence by 50% for non-adherent children a year after receiving the reminder letter. The response is immediate as only vaccination behavior in the quarter following the intervention is affected. The timing of the response suggests that the reminder letter mainly affects inattentive parents. The resulting coverage rates show that the reminder letter policy pushes the rate above the minimum herd immunity threshold for measles but falls short for pertussis (whooping cough). Furthermore, I estimate positive effects of the reminder letter on participation in a GP preventive care program but no spill-overs on participation in later vaccination rounds. I detect negative sibling spill-overs suggesting a cost of information as parents postpone vaccinations knowing they will be reminded.====Using my estimates, I decompose the group of parents of non-adherent children at age 2. I find that 8.7% are responsive, while 19.2% and 72.1% are delayers and non-responsive, respectively. Moreover, by evaluating heterogeneity, I discover that responsiveness to the reminder letter is stronger among not first-time parents, parents with an education in a health- or childcare-related field, parents of children with unproblematic births and parents without a university degree. The finding, that parents with an education in a health- or childcare-related field are non-responsive to the reminder letter, indicates that responsive parents were non-adherent due to inattention. Furthermore, as responsive parents have lower education levels, the reminder letter policy reduces socio-economic differences in vaccination adherence. Finally, a simple comparison of the effect on adherence and the cost of the policy shows that the vaccination reminder letter policy costs an estimated 1246 DKK (166 EUR) per additional fully-vaccinated child.====The paper contributes twofold to the understanding of vaccination adherence. First, I extend the literature on the impact of recall systems and reminder letter policies. While research on pro-vaccination campaigns finds modest to no effect (Leader et al., 2009, Chanel et al., 2011, Sadaf et al., 2013, Nyhan et al., 2014, Dubé et al., 2015, Buttenheim et al., 2016, Baskin, 2018),==== studies highlight that reminders and recall systems improve coverage in a wide variety of contexts (Vann and Szilagyi, 2005, Harvey et al., 2015). Closely related, Suppli et al., 2017, Suppli et al., 2018 evaluate the effects of the reminder letter policy in Denmark using the same natural experiment in a before-after strategy. They use a before-sample one year prior to the intervention and an after-sample one year post the intervention. They find that during a 6-month follow-up period 2264 more vaccinations are administered to children in the treatment group. I extend their analysis of the impact of the reminder letter policy in four distinct ways: (i) I address causality more rigorously by dealing with time trends and seasonality in a RDD, (ii) I relate the impact on adherence to herd immunity thresholds, (iii) I study other types of preventive care participation beyond the vaccination program and (iv) I test for persistent effects by studying younger siblings of the treated children.====Second, I provide evidence on the factors influencing vaccination non-adherence. Existing evidence has identified factors such as parents’ perception of infections and side-effects risks, religion, ideology and social pressure (Tickner et al., 2006, Grabenstein, 2013, Wombwell et al., 2015, Larson et al., 2016, Amin et al., 2017, Karing, 2018). Recently, a growing literature highlights misinformation as a major factor causing parents to opt out of vaccination programs (Anderberg et al., 2011, Chang, 2018, Hansen and Schmidtblaicher, 2019, Carrieri et al., 2019, Gørtz et al., 2020, Qian et al., 2020).==== The economic literature furthermore shows the difficulties in reaching full coverage due to free-riding (Philipson, 1996, Geoffard and Philipson, 1997, Oster, 2018): When a substantial share of the population is covered, the immunized individuals not only protect themselves but also lend protection to individuals without vaccinations. Consequently, the private benefit of vaccinations might be low in a society with relatively high coverage rates. My results indicate that reluctance is a leading cause for non-adherence in this setting and that other policies (beyond reminder letters) are necessary to substantially increase vaccination coverage (preferably after identifying the reasons for reluctance).====The paper proceed as follows: In Section 2, I provide background on The Danish Childhood Vaccination Program and describe the introduction and purpose of the policy. Section 3 covers my empirical strategy. Section 4 describes data and descriptive statistics. Section 5 presents results and section 6 performs a simple cost-effectiveness analysis.

Proximity to a national police station reduces the impact of local elections on injury rates.","Road traffic accidents are the main cause of mortality among people under age 45 and the leading cause of mortality for people between 15 and 29 (Eurostat, 2015). Not only more than 1.25 million deaths each year are recorded on the roads, but between 20 and 50 million more people suffer nonfatal injuries, which can result in temporary or permanent disabilities (WHO, 2015). The economic losses are substantial both individually and nationwide: most countries are estimated to lose approximately 3% of their GDP in lost productivity and medical expenditures (WHO, 2015), which does not include the costs of traffic congestion and fuel waste associated with traffic accidents. As a result, reducing traffic accidents is a top priority of policy makers: the 2030 United Nations Agenda for Sustainable Development includes halving the global number of road accidents among its targets. Different levels of government can play crucial roles in promoting this ambitious plan, which requires both effective traffic safety regulations and enforcement. National governments are often responsible for regulating the consumption of alcohol and the use of seat belts, child restraints, and helmets. Local governments and authorities play a tremendous role in road maintenance and direct law enforcement. Although the literature is rich on the impact of general safety measures on traffic accidents and fatalities (====, Cohen and Einav, 2003, Bourgeon and Picard, 2007, Adams and Cotti, 2008, Abouk and Adams, 2013), evidence on the role of local governments is scant. An exception is represented by Makowsky and Stratmann (2011) who relate a heterogeneous incidence of traffic citations across Massachusetts municipalities with differences in car crashes. Further evidence comes from developing countries, but it is primarily based on the channel of corruption of local officers (Bertrand et al., 2007, Anbarci et al., 2006, Law et al., 2009, Albalate and Yarygina, 2017, Wales, 2017).====We focus on the role of local governments in a developed country to assess if and how the municipal political cycle affects traffic accidents and their consequences, namely, injuries and deaths. In many countries, citizens elect local authorities and, in some cases, as in the US, even local police officers. Therefore, distortions associated with the political cycle might affect trends in traffic accidents by influencing law enforcement patterns at the local level. For instance, as elections approach, local politicians might want to show a strong commitment to fighting traffic accidents and increasing traffic safety; thus, we might expect a lower incidence of accidents in election years. However, incentives for strict law enforcement might be lower in election years since strict law enforcement might displease myopic voters and reduce political support. Voters are generally pleased with measures to fight crime while they do not regard a parking violation or texting while driving a crime.====By exploiting staggered municipal mayoral elections from 1995 to 2016 in almost 2000 municipalities in two Italian regions – Lombardy and Veneto (representing 26.10% of all Italian municipalities and counting 15,000,000 inhabitants) – we show, that in municipal election years, the number of traffic accidents with at least one injured per 1000 residents increases by 1.5% at the mean of traffic accidents. The injury rate (====, the number of injured per 1000 residents) increases by 2%, while the municipal political cycle has no impact on the fatality rate (====, the number of deaths per 1000 residents). We support these findings by showing that the types of accidents that are increasing the most are the least severe ones, that are daytime and rush hours accidents and accidents in good weather conditions. By contrast, the political cycle has no effect on the most severe types of accidents, namely, accidents that occur at night or on weekends. Based on a benchmark case (Section 3.2), we estimate that the overall loss per election year (====, 2000 municipalities with an average of 8000 inhabitants having an election) would amount to almost 64.5 million euro (2020) without considering the additional loss due to property-damage-only accidents.====These results are robust to different specifications of the municipal political cycle and to the use of different approaches to rule out the possibility that the election year effect is due to a higher likelihood of driving (as in Parry, 2004, Miller et al., 2009, Bertoli et al., 2018, Giulietti et al., 2018). Finally, we investigate whether part of the estimated effects can be explained as a function of other political cycles, as the political cycles linked to national elections or to neighboring municipalities. The national cycle coincides with the mayoral cycle for only 11% of our observed elections, and we drop the national election years to check if any part of our results are driven by that cycle: the magnitude of the impact of municipal election slightly increases on accident (+2%) and injury (+2.3%) rates, but still there is no effect on fatality rates. We do not find any significant spillover effects from elections in neighboring municipalities.====We exploit quarter-level data to provide insights on the dynamics within the election year (Akhmedov and Zhuravskaya, 2004). Increases in accident and injury rates are stronger during the quarters preceding the electoral quarter, when the electoral stakes are higher, and for new-elected mayors, in the second quarter following the election, when an elected mayor operationally begins serving her term. Results for post-election quarters for re-elected incumbent mayors are not statistically significant, although not economically negligible (+6/7%). We run placebo tests by using the quarter of elections in fake electoral years (year +2 and +3 from the election year). Our results are not driven by a quarter effect, even if they could still be affected by unaccounted seasonal effects.====Using municipalities’ budget items, only available at the yearly level, we investigate 4 possible mechanisms that can be affected by the political cycle and impact the incidence and consequences of road traffic accidents: tickets for traffic violations (revenues and rate); local police activity (police expenditures and kilometers recorded by patrol cars); expenditures for road maintenance; and street lighting (the number of street lights and their energy consumption). Ex-ante we might expect in election years that there is an increase in expenditures for both local police (Levitt, 1997) and road maintenance, that police patrols drive more, that street lights are fixed if needed, and that local politicians want to please voters by lowering salient taxes, as tickets for (minor) traffic violations are generally considered (Garrett and Wagner, 2009, Makowsky and Stratmann, 2009). However, we show, even through an event study model, that the results on accidents are consistently explained only by a perceived decrease in law enforcement due to a lower incidence of tickets. Tickets for traffic violations per 1000 residents decrease by 9.5% at the mean of the variable, while the revenues collected through tickets drop by 11%. To dig deeper into these results, we run a survey on a sample of municipalities that provided data on the tickets per type of violations (====, severe versus minor violations). In electoral years, the incidence of tickets for serious violations (====, speed violations and driving under the influence) does not change, whereas tickets for minor violations decrease (Table 12). These results are consistent with the estimated increase in the injury rate and the no-change in the fatality rate: pleasing voters is good, but deaths on the roads are bad.====Finally, we analyze how a set of non-political and political municipal characteristics channel the election year effect. As far as the characteristics of municipalities are concerned, the effect of the election year on the injury rate is stronger in small municipalities, municipalities located farther from a national police station, and municipalities which do not have the municipal police run in a consortium of municipalities. Based on this first set of drivers, we argue that a system of checks and balances, as in the case of the presence of a national police station, can mitigate opportunistic behaviors of local politicians which come at a health cost for the resident population. The second set of drivers concerns the political environment: the effect is stronger when there is less political competition (high margin of victory and fewer candidates) and when the quality of politicians (as captured by the electoral rule) is lower. It appears that lower quality politicians do not constitute a burden for merely sound budgets, but their decisions have consequences on the health of their voters even when they are not directly responsible for health expenditures, as in the case of Italian mayors.====Our paper also relates to the strand of literature on the strategic behavior of politicians throughout an electoral cycle. Although evidence on the link between the political cycle and fiscal policy is vast (Persson and Tabellini, 2002, Shi and Svensson, 2000, Brender and Drazen, 2005), scant attention has been devoted to whether an incumbent's strategic behaviors spillover to other domains of public policy, especially at the local level.==== Among the few exceptions are Englmaier and Stowasser (2017), who find that lending policies strategically respond to local elections at the county level in Germany, and Baskaran et al. (2015), who provide evidence of an electoral cycle in electricity service provision in Indian states. Closely related to the analysis of the public policy cycle at the local level is the work of Takako and Bessho (2018) on the employment of physicians in Japanese public hospitals, which increases in municipal election years, in line with findings for France by Clark and Milcent (2011) and for the US by Bee and Moulton (2015). Regarding the Italian case, our evidence on the municipal political cycle affecting tickets for traffic violations has been confirmed by Bracco (2018). Bracco (2018) uses budget data from all Italian municipalities to show that in an electoral year, which is captured by a dummy for the election year and the year before the election, tickets decrease. However, Bracco (2018) does not connect the cycle to traffic accidents, to their consequences. Because of these substantial differences, our contribution provides insights into the consequences of the political cycle on health and raises concerns on the multilevel governance of services related to public safety in a decentralized institutional framework.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides some background information on the electoral system and the data employed. Section 3 defines the empirical strategy and discusses the results. Section 4 presents a series of robustness checks, while Section 5 provides insights on the dynamics within the election year. Section 6 discusses and tests the potential mechanisms through which the political cycle can affect traffic accidents. Section 7 investigates the possible channels for the election year effect, and Section 8 concludes.",The political cycle of road traffic accidents,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629621000205,27 January 2021,2021,Research Article,169.0

Individuals treated with opioid pain relievers (OPR) develop addiction, which increases their demand for opioids and reduces their welfare and life expectancy through side effects and potential overdose. I calibrate the model for a benchmark American and investigate the comparative dynamics of alternative ====.","Economists have developed theories on how health affects productivity (e.g. Grossman (1972)), the utility experienced from consumption (e.g. Finkelstein et al. (2013); Schünemann et al. (2017a)), the length of life (e.g. Ehrlich and Chuma (1990); Dalgaard and Strulik (2014)), or the survival probability of individuals (e.g. Kuhn et al. (2015); Schünemann et al. (2017b)). This paper proposes a new theory that explores a separate channel through which health matters directly for wellbeing, life cycle choices, and longevity, namely through the experience of pain. This allows the discussion of a second form of treatment of illness, aside from investments in health maintenance and repair: the treatment of pain by analgesics (painkillers). Individuals are assumed to have alternative painkillers at their disposal that differ in price, efficacy, side effects on health, and the potential of addiction. Embedded in a life cycle theory of addiction, we then ask under which conditions individuals prefer pain treatment with opioid pain relievers (OPRs), quit using OPRs or switch to illicit opioid consumption, and whether OPR addiction can be rational. This discussion will take place in the context of the American opioid crisis (see Section 2).====The life cycle theory of addiction takes explicitly into account that life length is finite, endogenous, and affected by health and addiction behavior. When life is finite no steady state (of addiction) exists. This is so because a steady state is only reached asymptotically as time goes to infinity, which is impossible if life is finite. Formally, the boundary conditions for finite and infinite life are different such that lifetime behavior of individuals with finite and infinite life differs. That this distinction is relevant for OPR use is obvious when we consider opioid treatment in palliative care where remaining life expectancy is short and addiction is unlikely to fully develop compared to an opioid treatment of back pain in young age. In this sense, the proposed theory differs conceptually from most of the related addiction literature, where behavior is discussed at the steady state, and is thus (explicitly or implicitly) based on the assumption of an infinite life (e.g. Becker and Murphy, 1988; Orphanides and Zervos, 1995, Orphanides and Zervos, 1998; Gruber and Koszegi, 2001; see Strulik, 2018, for an exception). A life cycle theory allows to consider individuals who take into account the side effects of opioid use on health and the probability of premature death through overdose.====We discuss painkiller addiction under two different behavioral assumptions. According to the theory developed by Becker and Murphy (1988), individuals understand how their addiction develops and they take this knowledge into account when they make their life cycle plans. This means that they optimally plan and control their addiction (if there is any). The consideration of fully rational addiction has been dubbed TORA (theory of rational addiction; Cawley and Ruhm (2012)). Alternatively, Strulik (2018) has proposed a theory of imperfectly rational addiction, in which otherwise fully rational individuals fail to optimally plan and control their addiction. We call this behavior imperfectly rational and abbreviate it analogously as TICA (theory of imperfectly controlled addiction).====This study shows analytically and with numerical experiments that TORA and TICA addicts respond fundamentally different to price and information shocks. An information shock assumes that an OPR, that formerly was thought to be non-addictive, is found to be addictive. As an optimal response to this information, TORA addicts are predicted to always reduce their consumption and in many cases the reduction leads eventually to an endogenous quitting of OPR use. TICA addicts, in contrast, do not respond with reduced consumption, but further develop their addiction, and consume even more OPRs. In a second computational experiment, it is shown that, after the termination of an OPR prescription, TORA addicts quit instantaneously while TICA addicts switch to the use of illicit opioids (heroin). These predictions can be used to identify whether painkiller addicts are fully rational and able to control their addiction. Clearly, drug policies (beyond information) are particularly in need if addiction is not fully rational. For the benchmark calibration it is estimated that an ideal methadone treatment would increase the value of life of an imperfectly rational OPR addict by about 13 percent and life expectancy at 20 by about 9 years.====OPR consumption behavior predicted for TICA individuals could possibly be explained as well by other theories of addiction under bounded rationality, for example, based on assumptions of myopia or time-inconsistent decision making (although these theories are not yet available as life cycle theories). However, the assumptions needed to explain addiction would be much stronger because they would imply suboptimal (myopic or inconsistent) decision making also for all other domains of intertemporal choice. The assumption that individuals cannot perfectly control an addiction is minimal-invasive because it allows addicts to make rational decisions in other areas of daily life. It supports a benign view on painkiller addicts in the sense that their only imperfection is their failure to control the addiction. This view seems to be particularly appropriate to address an opioid addiction problem that has hit individuals from all strata of society. It is policy-relevant since TICA individuals need support for quitting their addiction. Full disclosure of the addictive potential of OPRs is not sufficient for them to quit and the discontinuation of an OPR prescription pushes them to illicit opioid use and further deteriorates their life.====In order to investigate how the unintentional transition from pain patient to opioid addict affects health, longevity, and welfare, the theory of painkiller addiction is embedded in the life cycle model of health deficit accumulation by Dalgaard and Strulik (2014). The health deficit model implements the insight from medical science that individuals, as they grow older, develop health disorders, ranging from mild nuisances to serious conditions. Health deficits are measured by the so called frailty index (Mitnitski et al. (2002a)). The frailty index provides the relative number of health deficits that an individual has from a long list of potential deficits. It has been shown that a quasi-exponential association between age and the frailty index exists and that the frailty index predicts death with high precision (Mitnitski et al. (2002b)). Given the observable measure of health deficits, the health deficit model is straightforward to calibrate and it has a microfoundation in biology, based on reliability and redundancy of body cells (Gavrilov and Gavrilova (1991)).==== Strulik (2018) uses the health deficit model to discuss addiction with respect to smoking. The study shows that, in a life cycle context, fully rational individuals increase consumption of addictive goods in old age and, in particular, shortly before death. Since actual cigarette consumption declines in old age, the theory questions whether TORA behavior appropriately captures cigarette addiction. Increasing end-of-life consumption is less suitable to exclude TORA behavior for opioids. The present paper thus proposes two new behavioral predictions to test for TORA addiction.====The theory of painkiller consumption assumes that pain is caused either instantaneously or gradually by the arrival of health deficits and is captured by a downward shift of the utility function. This feature makes pain observationally similar to depression as conceptualized in Strulik (2019) since both pain and depression reduce utility without apparent change in the fundamentals that typically enter the utility function. Indeed, it has been found that depression and pain share the same biological pathways and neurotransmitters and often respond to similar treatments (Bair et al., 2003, Verdu et al., 2008). The main difference between the present study and Strulik (2019) is the modeling and analysis of treatment. While in Strulik (2019) treatment is regarded to be always health- and welfare-improving we here explicitly consider its dark side. In particular, individuals may become addicted to the treatment, as increasing tolerance may motivate the consumption of higher doses of treatment. The cravings from addiction may generate pain that motivates to sustain treatment even when the original cause of pain is gone. Also, in contrast to Strulik (2019), treatment may have side-effects on health and bear the risk of death from overdose. Another distinguishing feature from Strulik (2019) is that individuals consider a vector of potential treatments with different prices, efficacy, and health repercussions.====The paper is organized as follows. To motivate the theory, the next section provides a brief overview of the literature on pain, pain treatment, and the opioid crisis. In Section 3, I integrate utility-reducing pain, treatment by alternative analgesics and illicit drugs, opioid addiction, and overdose death, into a life-cycle model of endogenous health and longevity. In Section 4, propositions on the determinants of painkiller use are proven. In Section 5, I parameterize and solve the full model and calibrate it for a benchmark U.S. American and three stylized painkillers. In Section 6, I present the main results on painkiller use and its effects on wellbeing and longevity. I show robustness of the conclusion that fully informed TORA individuals do not use OPRs for pain reduction and that a notable exception is opioid use in palliative care, i.e. when pain is combined with drastic life-shortening health shocks. In Section 7, I use computational experiments to identify the behavioral responses of fully rational and imperfectly rational OPR addicts to information and prescription shocks. I investigate the transition to non-medical OPR-use and heroin consumption and estimate the gains in terms of life expectancy and value of life from an ideal methadone treatment of OPR addiction.

DI provides cash benefits and health insurance; the health insurance benefit is especially valuable to the DI population because of high healthcare needs. As lawmakers consider policies to address the rising DI rates (Autor, 2015), it is important to have a better understanding of how individuals’ behaviors are guided by health insurance provision. The largest expansion in public subsidies for health insurance for the under-age-65 population since the inception of Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) provides us with an opportunity to improve our understanding of the role of health insurance in DI applications. In this paper, we test the importance of health insurance in two ways. First, subsidized health insurance may hasten DI application for those with ESI on the job, as for them the two-year waiting period for DI health insurance provision makes the DI application itself burdensome. Second, for those workers who do not have ESI, subsidized health insurance as an outside option may reduce applications for DI, as one can earn more in cash wages than is replaced by DI’s cash benefit. This second incentive is reflected in discussions that occurred prior to the ACA’s major insurance expansions in the context of growing DI rolls: Kennedy and Blodgett (2012) write in the New England Journal of Medicine that “Adults with potentially work-limiting disabilities residing in these {expansion} states will be able to obtain Medicaid without first obtaining SSI through disability eligibility.… ACA will reduce HIMDE (Health Insurance Motivated Disability Enrollment), addressing one major source of disability-program growth.” Thus far, however, ACA-related research on disability applications has not been able to separately examine these two considerations, as such research would require information on baseline income and relevant health insurance options.====We examine behavioral responses to the increased availability of health insurance following the ACA on participation in the Social Security Disability Insurance program,==== using a panel data set of the universe of U.S. tax records spanning 2007-2016. Through our analysis, we find suggestive evidence that outside options for health insurance matter, though magnitudes are small and results are not always statistically precise. More specifically, we find small and statistically insignificant estimates when we study the effect of Medicaid expansions using a state DD identification strategy. However, when we estimate the effect of being eligible for high vs. low Marketplace subsidies based on geography, we find some evidence consistent with subsidies increasing DI claiming among those with prior access to ESI, and decreasing DI claiming otherwise.====The ACA is estimated to have reduced the uninsured population by about 12.8 million (Carrasquillo and Mueller, 2018), while potentially decreasing the price of coverage for millions more. This is especially true for non-elderly adults with disabilities, given their high likelihood of qualifying for ACA subsidies due to the lower income that accompanies poor health status (Deaton, 2002) and because of the community rating rules of the ACA. DI beneficiaries are also eligible for health coverage through Medicare, but only after a 29-month waiting period from the established onset of the disabling condition (or 24 months from entitlement of cash benefits). This creates the potential for interactions between these two social programs. DI program participation could increase as a result of the ACA, as the ACA allows individuals to withstand the long wait for health benefits after applying for DI. But DI program participation could also decrease, as attaining health insurance is no longer tied to enrollment in that program. We hypothesize these effects will depend on whether individuals have access to health insurance while working that they could lose by exiting employment to pursue DI benefits.====This paper contributes to a large literature studying the effects of health insurance availability on disability program participation. Depending on the data sources, some past studies have focused on DI, which applies to individuals with sufficient work history (and thus greater resources) while others focus on SSI, which is more relevant for those with fewer resources. Maestas, Mullen and Strand (2014) examine the impacts of the Massachusetts reform on DI (including concurrent Supplemental Security Income) claims and find decreases in DI claims in counties with low pre-reform health insurance coverage and increases in DI claims in counties with high pre-reform coverage. The published literature that examines the impacts of Medicaid expansions on SSI applications (Burns and Dague, 2017, Soni et al., 2017, Baicker et al., 2014) generally finds that Medicaid expansions reduce SSI applications, though Chatterji and Li (2017), Anand et al. (2019) and Schmidt et al. (2020) find mixed evidence. Thus, there is no clear consensus from the literature on the effects of health insurance expansions on either DI or SSI applications.====The literature on disability applications and health insurance expansion are part of a broader literature studying the relationship between health insurance, labor supply and program participation. Health insurance tied to program participation or to work could create a “lock.” DI may have been a valuable source of new health insurance, especially for those leaving small firms, those working less than full time or those without working spouses, any of whom may have had difficulty in finding employer-sponsored health insurance while working. Thus, ACA coverage can release this lock for those who earlier sought DI at the margin for its health insurance provision.====Our paper offers several contributions to the literature on health-related social program interactions. First, while almost all prior studies have used the Current Population Survey (CPS, ∼150 thousand individuals a year) or the American Community Survey (ACS, ∼3 million households a year), our data set contains the population of U.S. tax records, covering the entire tax-paying population of the U.S. (roughly 140 million returns or 290 million individuals a year). Large sample sizes are necessary to distinguish statistically insignificant but potentially economically meaningful effects from true zeros. Furthermore, our data contain precise income measures used for determining program benefits eligibility. The Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) measure is not available in the CPS or ACS, and its omission could lead to attenuation bias when the treatment group is not accurately identified. The large sample size and richness of our data also allow us to examine effects in subpopulations that are affected to greater degrees: those with employer health insurance at baseline relative to those without. Our methods of identification are otherwise standard and have been used in the prior literature: we test these hypotheses comparing disability program participation for individuals in states and counties that experienced a greater extent of coverage availability under the ACA to states that did not, after the ACA to before the ACA. We do this by asking whether the policy changes led to a greater fraction of DI beneficiaries with income in ranges that qualified for ACA health insurance subsidies, which allows us to judge the differential behavioral response of those whose incentives changed under the policy.====We find suggestive evidence that there is indeed an interaction between these two programs. The ACA’s insurance expansion appears to have increased DI participation for those who did have ESI and decreased DI participation for those who did not. However, the effects are small in magnitude, and only present for ACA insurance expansions through the Marketplace, not for Medicaid expansion. The fact that Medicaid expansion produced statistically insignificant and small estimates indicates that health insurance was not impactful in DI application decisions on the margin for those at very low levels of income, which makes sense, since DI applications (the only disability program we can study in tax data) apply more to those with greater resources, for whom the Marketplace program is more relevant than Medicaid. However, even in the higher Marketplace income ranges, our results indicate fairly modest DI responses to health insurance relative to the literature.",How Much Do Outside Options Matter?

I exploit an administrative rule that creates a discontinuous jump in relative age for grade for children born around January 1. Being young-for-grade leads to a higher probability of an ,"Risky behaviors such as unprotected sex and binge drinking peak in adolescence and young adulthood. In 2015, 68.5 % of abortions in the U.S. were among 15–30-year-olds (Jatlaoui et al., 2018) and, among drinkers in the U.S. and Europe, heavy episodic drinking was most common for 15–24-year-olds (WHO, 2018). However, these types of risky behavior can have severe health consequences and may have a negative impact on the educational performance and labor market outcomes (for an overview see, Cawley and Ruhm, 2011). Because of this, risky sex and heavy drinking are serious health issues for adolescents and it is a policy goal to decrease the occurrence.====This paper uses full-population, Danish register data to investigate the effect of relative age for grade for adolescent women’s outcomes associated with risky sex and heavy drinking. To learn about the effect of relative age for grade, I exploit the differences in relative age for grade originating from the school starting age. The recent literature on school starting age finds that a later school start leads to improved behavior in adolescence when considering crime (Landersø et al., 2017), teenage childbearing (Black et al., 2011; Tan, 2017), mental health (Black et al., 2011; Dee and Sievertsen, 2018) and substance use (Argys and Rees, 2008).==== With survey measures of risky health behavior, the latter paper relates most closely to this paper. I build on the previous work by considering the effect of relative age for grade on a comprehensive set of register based outcomes measuring the consequences of risky sex and heavy drinking.====Relative age for grade may affect risky sex and heavy drinking through three channels. First, being young-for-grade advances the educational cycle by a given age. This may affect risky sex and heavy drinking if behavior concerning sex and drinking depends on whether you are a senior or junior in high school, and not only whether your biological age is 18 or 17. Skirbekk. et al. (2004) find that this is the case for childbirths and marriage. If Skirbekk et al.’s results reflect an underlying behavior concerning sex and romantic relationships, the results could apply to risky sex as well. The educational cycle affects adolescents through the curriculum, social norms and expectations and “incapacitation”. Social norms and expectations related to a grade may depend upon school peers’ average age. Incapacitation comes from being in school; thus, it is the difference between being a senior in high school as opposed to having graduated. Second, being young-for-grade implies that a woman is younger compared to her peers, which could lead to more risky sex and heavy drinking because older peers exert a pressure when it comes to drinking and sex (Argys and Rees, 2008).==== Third, young-for-graders could potentially have lower levels of skills and maturity at school start. The lower level could persist throughout the educational cycle and even grow.====This paper uses Danish register data where I combine individual-level information on women’s abortions, alcohol poisonings, births, contraceptive use, cohabitation and chlamydia treatment with information on an individual’s enrollment and completion of education, school peers and background characteristics. I follow the women from age 15–30 and consider whether or not a woman experiences an outcome and the number of times it occurs. The register data avoids problems with self-reports, which are often a concern for risky health behaviors.====To identify a causal effect, I exploit a discontinuity in relative age for grade created by the administrative rule that children should start school in the calendar year they turn seven. I use the population of 89,496 women born +/- two months around New Year from November 1981 to February 1992. The administrative rule stipulates that girls born on December 31 are 6.6 years old when starting school whereas girls born the day after, January 1 are 7.6 years old. This gives rise to a fuzzy regression discontinuity design, where I can investigate the effect of relative age for grade on risky health behaviors (see e.g. Evans et al. (2010) and Landersø et al. (2017) for papers that use the same approach). I observe relative age for grade in the 8th grade, but this relates closely to relative age for grade at school start because very few children repeat or skip a grade. I verify this using newer and richer data (see also Landersø et al., 2017 and 2020, who use the same setup).====The results show that being young-for-grade leads to 3%-points higher probability of an abortion by age 20 (mean 8.3 %). However, by age 30, the estimate is smaller and insignificant. Furthermore, being young-for-grade leads to 1.8 %-points higher probability of an alcohol poisoning by age 20 (mean 3.1 %). By age 30, the estimate for an alcohol poisoning is still substantial at 1.6 %-points, though it is imprecisely estimated. The results also show an increase in the probability of a birth and cohabitation by age 22, an increase in contraceptive use by age 16, but no effect on chlamydia. On the intensive margin, the estimates show a significant increase in the number of abortions by age 25.====The results likely reflect how being young-for-grade affects risky sex through an earlier sexual debut and an earlier involvement in romantic relationships. Results using information on enrollment and completion of education suggest that the advanced educational cycle is a driver of this. Thus, women form romantic relationships according to grade instead of biological age. For alcohol poisonings, the channels that drive the increase is less clear. Furthermore, results for men show that relative age for grade does not affect men’s alcohol poisonings, chlamydia, cohabitation and fatherhood. I discuss two potential reasons for the difference between men and women. First, the same inputs and policies may affect men and women differently and second, compliers to the school starting age rule may be different between men and women.====Argys and Rees (2008) is the paper most similar to this paper. They use data from the NLSY97==== and exploit the school starting age rule to investigate the effect of being younger than the peers within a grade. They interpret their results as a peer effect and study several outcomes related to adolescent risky health behavior. Most related to this paper are the results for drinking and sexual activity as measured by having had an alcoholic beverage within the past 30 days and having had sexual intercourse within the past 12 months. The results show a positive effect of being younger than the peers on drinking for girls, but no effect on sexual activity for girls and outcomes for boys. I complement Argys and Rees’ work by using register-based information on the consequences of risky sex and heavy drinking and focusing on effects across grades to consider the interplay between the educational cycle, the educational environment and adolescent risky health behavior.====There are only few papers that look at the educational environment and risky health behavior. Yet, children and adolescents spend a substantial amount of time in school and, thus, education and school peers may be an important part of shaping perceptions and attitudes towards such behaviors. Exceptions are Elsner and Isphording (2018) who find that a higher achievement rank in high school leads to less risky behavior and Dincer et al. (2014) and Reynoso and Rossi (2019) who also find some support that length and time of day of education matters for risky sex. I contribute by showing that the educational cycle shapes women’s risky health behavior and not only biological age drives the peak in risky health behaviors in adolescence. As peers may form social norms and expectations about sex and drinking through the educational cycle, this does not contrast the literature on peer effects in risky health behaviors (e.g. Card and Giuliano, 2013 and Yakusheva and Fletcher, 2015). The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 provides a description of the data and Section 3 describes the methods.

There is growing interest in the effects of high-skilled immigrants on US labor markets. Some recent studies show that an influx of highly educated immigrants can suppress wages and crowd out natives seeking similar occupations or educational opportunities (Borjas, 2006; Borjas and Doran, 2012; Bound et al., 2015; Orrenius and Zavodny, 2015); however, other research has shown improvements in innovation and productivity through worker complementarities (Kerr, 2013; Kerr and Lincoln, 2010; Mithas and Lucas, 2010; Peri, 2012; Saxenian, 2002). A parallel relevant literature examines higher education markets and how international enrollment at universities affects enrollment of domestic students (Shih, 2017; Stuen et al., 2012). A key component of the debate revolves around the degree to which immigrant labor substitutes for domestic labor.====In this paper I examine a symmetric question. Specifically, I examine the extent to which high-skill non-citizen workers, in the form of international medical school graduates seeking residency training in US teaching hospitals, are displaced by US citizens who received their medical school training from international medical schools. Teaching hospitals recruit and train medical school graduates (both domestic and international) before they can be licensed as physicians in the US. Thus, teaching hospitals are responsible for producing the next generation of practicing physicians through residency programs. Beginning in 2009, heightened enforcement of existing laws and increased fees for employers increased the cost of obtaining certain common visas. My research uses the stronger regulatory environment around H-1B visa applicants to study the demand response of physician employers and subsequent spillovers to the larger health care system.====The US health care system accounts for approximately $3 trillion in annual spending and represents nearly one-fifth of all economic activity within the country (Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2014). To help satisfy the demand for medical services, immigrant clinicians, especially physicians and nurses, are recruited and relied upon to supplement the native supply of health care personnel. Currently, more than a quarter of all US physicians received their medical education outside the US and the share is expected to rise to one-third in the near future (Boulet et al., 2009; Eckhert, 2010; Gozu et al., 2009). Changes in immigration policies may have consequences to the flow of foreign-trained clinicians to the US labor market. A change in immigration may affect the labor market opportunities of domestic health care professionals and possibly cause unintended downstream consequences for the provision of medical services to consumers, if, for example, rural health care needs are more difficult to meet because fewer immigrant health care workers are available.====My results show a sharp substitution by teaching hospitals in favor of foreign-trained US citizen applicants in place of foreign-trained non-citizen applicants seeking H-1B visas. I then show that the compositional shift in physician labor leads to fewer new physicians choosing to work in under-served areas. I do not find evidence that hospital intensity of service was affected, which at least partly validates my finding of a high apparent degree of substitution between foreign medical school trained non-citizens and foreign medical school trained citizens. My research more generally highlights the choices teaching hospitals confront given the evolving immigration policy environment and financial circumstances as well as potential (and likely unintended) implications for other health policy objectives such as improving provider access. This is especially important within a setting where hospitals are directly benefiting from publicly subsidized high-skilled labor.",Regulating high-skilled immigration: The market for medical residents,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629621000217,22 January 2021,2021,Research Article,173.0

We define absolute and relative health perception biases, illustrate their measurement in surveys and provide evidence on their relevance. Next, we decompose the theoretical effect into its extensive and intensive margin: When the extensive margin dominates, people (wrongly) believe they are healthy enough to “afford” unhealthy behavior. Finally, using three population surveys, we provide robust empirical evidence that respondents who overestimate their health are less likely to exercise and sleep enough, but more likely to eat unhealthily and drink alcohol daily.","Can risky health behavior be “optimal”? While most non-economists would immediately refute this thought, economists would probably answer “it depends” and observe that, although drinking alcohol or eating junk food can be detrimental to health, people pursue those activities because they are also pleasurable. For economists, the optimality of a risky health behavior ultimately depends on the associated cost and benefits as perceived by the individual (Grossman, 1972, Becker and Murphy, 1988, Dragone, 2009, Cawley and Ruhm, 2011).====According to the benchmark theoretical framework, economic agents have perfect information and infinite computational capacity, which allows them to correctly assess costs and benefits of each alternative and, accordingly, choose optimal risky behavior. Behavioral economists have challenged this view by empirically and theoretically studying behavior that deviates from the predictions obtained under perfect rationality and information (cf. Rabin, 2013). In health economics, influential studies have shown that consumers pick dominated health plans and leave money on the table (Abaluck and Gruber, 2011, Abaluck and Gruber, 2016, Ketcham et al., 2012, Ketcham et al., 2016, Bhargava et al., 2017, Kettlewell, 2020). Research has also cited behavioral phenomena as explanations for why people engage in “too much” risky health behavior. For example, theoretical papers model the role of hyperbolic discounting and time inconsistencies for smoking and overeating (Gruber and Kőszegi, 2001, Strulik and Trimborn, 2018). In a field experiment among college students, Avery et al. (2019) show that present-biased individuals are more likely to take up commitment devices to sleep enough, which reduces their insufficient sleep significantly. To explain the fact that many gym members overpay (Della Vigna and Malmendier, 2006), other field experiments find that nudges to exercise more regularly are mostly effective in the short-run (Royer et al., 2015, Carrera et al., 2018, Carrera et al., 2020).====This paper is one of the first to investigate whether biased health perceptions could be a potential driving force of risky health behaviors. The causes and consequences of biased beliefs about own health are inherently difficult to study in causal effects frameworks, which is one reason why the health economics literature on this topic is very scant. One of the notable exceptions is Harris (2017) who finds that people who overestimate their activity levels consume more calories.==== As a first main contribution, we formally introduce the concept of ==== into the (health) economics literature and document the existence of biased health perceptions in the population using three high quality datasets. Specifically, we propose two individual measures of ==== and ==== health perception biases. Absolute perception biases are biased perceptions solely of own health, whereas relative perception biases are biased perceptions of own health ==== to the health of the population and peers (cf. Blanchflower et al., 2009, Mathieu-Bolh and Wendner, 2020). We show that, under plausible assumptions, there exists a one-to-one positive mapping between these two health perception measures.====Although we deliberately choose the much broader definition and interpretation of “health perception biases”, our measures could also be interpreted in the context of the concept of “overconfidence” (Camerer and Lovallo, 1999, Barber and Odean, 2001, Burks et al., 2013, Spinnewijn, 2015, Bago d’Uva et al., 2020, Cowan, 2018) or, outside economics, of overoptimism biases (Weinstein, 1980, Weinstein, 1989, Sharot, 2011) and self-esteem (Himmler and Koenig, 2012). Overconfidence implies that a person believes that her ability, performance or information is better than it actually is (Benoît and Dubra, 2011, Ortoleva and Snowberg, 2015, Heidhues et al., 2019). It is an intuitive notion that has, however, no unambiguous definition or measurement in the economics literature. Studies have operationalized it as (i) overestimation of own performance, (ii) overplacement of own performance relative to others, or (iii) overprecision of own information or beliefs (Moore and Healy, 2008).====Our definitions of absolute and relative health perception biases are akin to the first two operationalizations of overconfidence, (i) overestimation and (ii) overplacement. However, it is important to emphasize that we do not aim at explaining ==== people have biased health perceptions, nor does this paper argue about the rationality of such beliefs. Our main goal is to theoretically and empirically investigate biased health perceptions as a potential underlying mechanism for health-related behavior and outcomes. To avoid confusion among the many notions of overconfidence, in this paper we simply refer to “health perception biases.” Moreover, we would like to clarify that this paper investigates the role of biased perceptions about own health, not the role of biased perceptions about the ==== of risky behavior (cf. Viscusi, 1990, Lundborg, 2007, Ziebarth, 2018, Belot et al., 2019).====As the quote in the epigraph demonstrates, but as also evident from the medical literature and guidelines, humans make decisions about their health behavior not just based on the health consequences of such behavior but also based on their personal (perceived) health status (National Institutes of Health, 2000, Maguire et al., 2000, Zwald et al., 2019). This is the core of this paper: If an individual's perception about her health status is biased, how could this health perception bias possibly affect her health behavior, and under what conditions does it deviate from behavior under correct beliefs?====Note that, to identify perception biases, the researcher must not only know the individual's perception of her health but also her true health status. To measure ====, we use objectively diagnosed health conditions (high cholesterol and high blood pressure) and elicit how respondents’ perceptions about having such a condition deviate from the truth. In a representative German survey, we find that 30% of the population have biased perceptions about their high cholesterol levels.====To measure ====, we asked respondents to rank their health status relative to a reference group. Specifically, for the purpose of this paper, we included the question in two high-quality surveys from Germany (one representative survey and one interdisciplinary survey). Comparing the elicited subjective ranking to the objective ranking within the population health distribution produces our measure of relative health perception biases. Consistent with the absolute measure, we find that about 30% of the respondents overestimate their rank in the population health distribution by at least 30 ranks. That is, for instance, they believe that they rank at the 70th percentile when they actually only rank at the 40th percentile of the population health distribution. In particular, we find an excess mass of people who believe that they rank between the 70th and the 90th percentile of the population health distribution.====To bound the impact of reporting errors in subjective health (cf. Lindeboom and van Doorslaer, 2004, Ziebarth, 2010), we benchmark our relative health perception measure against the standard Self Assessed Health (SAH) measure as well as the 12-Item Short Form (SF12) health survey measure. By construction, generic health measures like the SF12 include fewer systematic response biases as they are designed to produce unbiased continuous measures of physical and mental health. As the researcher requires an unbiased benchmark health measure to empirically identify perception biases, we test the robustness of our findings and the relevance of reporting errors by using both the SAH and SF12 as benchmark measures while controlling for a rich set of socio-demographics. While our true benchmark health measures for the ==== are objective but also narrowly focused on physical health, the SAH and SF12 measure overall health and follow a broader concept. The empirical pattern and population distributions of two absolute and two relative bias measures across three different datasets yield important insights into the robustness and prevalence of such biases.====Next, we provide a theoretical framework that shows how biased health perceptions can affect risky health behavior. The framework is simple and flexible enough to explain nonlinear patterns between biased beliefs and risky behavior. Moreover, it highlights that biased health perceptions affect behavior through an extensive and an intensive margin, and that these margins operate in opposite directions. When the extensive margin dominates, risky health behavior and biased health perceptions are complements. This means that, the better the perception of own health, the more an individual engages in unhealthy behavior, such as consuming fast food or not exercising. This is akin to saying: “Because I believe I am very healthy and can afford it, I eat more fast food and exercise less.” On the contrary, when the intensive margin of perceived health dominates, risky health behavior and biased health perceptions are substitutes, hence a better perceived health reduces risky behavior. This is akin to saying: “Because I perceive large health costs of risky behavior, I will eat less fast food and exercise more.” Whether the extensive or intensive margin dominates is an empirical question.====Hence, as a final contribution, we document robust statistical links between health perception biases and risky health behaviors across all three datasets. Specifically, individuals who overestimate their health are significantly more likely to not exercise, to eat unhealthy, to be overweight and to sleep fewer hours. The statistical relationships are robust to controlling for socio-demographics, personality traits, cognitive skills, and risk aversion. They are also robust across our two notions of health perception biases. In the context of our model, these results are consistent with a dominant role of the extensive margin of health perception biases. Conversely, we do not find significant relationships for unbiased respondents and for those who are pessimistic about their health, a finding that is consistent with the extensive and intensive margin of health perception bias offsetting each other.==== Notably, we find that smoking is not correlated with biased health perceptions. This result is consistent with Darden (2017), who finds that cardiovascular biomarker information from repeated health exams does not significantly alter smoking behavior. A possible explanation is that signals and information about own health, be it objective as in Darden (2017) or perceived as in this paper, are not powerful drivers of smoking behavior, possibly because its addictive nature prevents the proper evaluation of the health consequences of smoking.",Biased health perceptions and risky health behaviors—Theory and evidence,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629621000102,22 January 2021,2021,Research Article,174.0

We observe meaningful reductions in labor supply measured in terms of employment-to-population ratios, hours worked, and earnings in states more exposed to reformulation relative to those less exposed. We also find evidence of increases in disability applications and beneficiaries.","The opioid crisis in the United States is a national emergency. In 2017 alone, more than 70,000 individuals died of drug overdoses; almost 70% involved opioids (Scholl et al., 2019). There is widespread interest in understanding the broader effects of the opioid crisis beyond overdoses. In particular, policymakers and researchers have expressed concern about its economic consequences and its implications for labor markets and social insurance programs.==== There is evidence that the link between the crisis and the labor market may be especially strong, and the Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell maintained that the opioid crisis is having a “substantial” effect on the United States economy.====Complicating efforts to quantify the broader effects of the opioid crisis, the epidemic continues to evolve. Before 2010, the “first wave” was driven primarily by misuse of natural and semi-synthetic opioids, such as OxyContin. In 2010, a pivotal transformation produced a second wave, a heroin epidemic, which transitioned in 2013 into the third wave--an illicit fentanyl crisis. These waves can be observed in fatal overdose trends by opioid type, which are presented in Fig. 1. Recent research suggests that the transformation from prescription to illicitly-manufactured opioids was driven by the reformulation of OxyContin. In 2010, Purdue Pharma introduced an abuse-deterrent version of OxyContin, replacing the original formulation. This replacement represented a substantial shock to the availability of abusable prescription opioids as OxyContin was often the “drug of choice” for non-medical users (Cicero et al., 2005). Prior research has shown that states with higher rates of non-medical use of OxyContin experienced disproportionate growth in heroin overdose rates after reformulation (Alpert et al., 2018). In recent years, widespread substitution to illicit opioids has only increased in importance (Pardo et al., 2019), leading to disproportionately fast growth in overdose death rates in states more exposed to reformulation (Powell and Pacula, 2021).====A small, but growing, literature empirically analyses how prescription opioid availability and overprescribing affect the labor market. Focusing on the overprescribing dimension, Harris et al. (2019) find that areas with more high-volume prescribers have lower labor force participation rates. Krueger (2017) and Aliprantis et al. (2019) suggest that the rise in opioid prescribing since 2000 can explain a meaningful share of the decline in labor force participation over that time period, comparing labor supply changes in areas with faster growth in opioid supply to those with lower growth. Currie et al. (2019) and Savych et al. (2019) also study geographic variation in measures of prescribing behavior over time. It is rare in this literature to leverage policy-driven variation. A recent exception is, Beheshti (2019b), who exploits the differential geographic impacts of the rescheduling of hydrocodone, finding convincing evidence that reduced medical access to hydrocodone improved labor force participation rates.====To date, the literature on the labor supply impacts of the opioid crisis measures opioid exposure in terms of geographic prescribing rates and legal opioid supply. In contrast, this paper examines the labor supply and disability insurance effects of the transition from prescription opioids to illicit opioids, drugs that are not measured in prescriptions. This perspective is perhaps more relevant to the current state of the epidemic given that the opioid crisis continues to escalate despite a 60% drop in prescription opioid volume in the United States since 2011 (IQVIA Institute, 2020). More broadly, it is rare to study the labor supply and social insurance consequences of a large shock to the size of illicit drug markets.====We analyze how the reformulation of OxyContin affected labor market outcomes and applications for disability benefits. As the supply of abusable prescriptions opioids decreased, people switched to illicit markets and these markets grew disproportionately in areas where OxyContin misuse had been more prevalent (Powell and Pacula, 2021). Given evidence that OxyContin reformulation transformed the opioid crisis, it is important to understand how that transformation affected social insurance programs and the labor market. Estimates of the productivity costs of illicit drug use in the literature are large. Jiang et al. (2017) conclude that heroin use disorder alone in the United States results in over $5 billion of productivity losses annually. In addition, a host of papers have explored the association between personal drug use and labor supply outcomes (e.g., Kaestner, Robert, 1994; Zarkin et al., 1998; MacDonald and Pudney, 2000; French and Christopher Roebuck, 2001; DeSimone, Jeff, 2002) or used policy variation to identify this relationship (e.g., Nicholas and Maclean, 2019; Sabia and Nguyen, 2018). We explore the direction and magnitude of effects from a broad market-wide shift from prescription opioids to illicit opioids.====There is also interest in understanding the broader effects of supply-side interventions designed to deter opioid misuse, and a small literature has documented possible labor supply effects of prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) (Kilby, 2015; Franco et al., 2019; Deiana and Giua, 2019; Kaestner and Ziedan, 2020). This paper also intersects with the literature studying the labor supply consequences of access to prescription drugs. Prior research found evidence that access to Cox-2 inhibitors increased labor force participation in the United States (Garthwaite, 2012) and decreased sickness absences in Norway (Bütikofer and Skira, 2018). We study the removal of an abusable formulation of a pain management therapy when more dangerous pharmacological substitutes are available illicitly.====We use several complementary data sets to document labor supply outcomes including data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), Current Employment Statistics (CES), and the American Community Survey (ACS) to construct measures of labor supply such as the employment rate, hours worked, and earnings. We also rely on administrative data from the Social Security Administration (SSA) concerning applications and allowances for disability benefits through Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). We study these disability-related measures for two reasons. First, misuse of medical and illicit opioids may put people at risk of permanently reducing labor supply, making disability insurance applications and allowances useful proxies for longer-term labor force attachment in this context.====Second, there is significant policy interest in what drives increases in disability insurance applications and enrollment, especially when these mechanisms are not more traditional factors predicting disability enrollment such as demographic shifts. At $143 billion, SSDI represents 4% of the federal budget.==== Several papers have found that worsening local economic conditions predict increases in disability payments (Autor and Duggan, 2003; Black et al., 2002; Autor et al., 2013; Charles et al., 2018; Maestas et al., 2018). However, there is little work exploring how the growth of illicit drug markets affects enrollment in disability insurance programs.====At an individual level, substitution from OxyContin to heroin or fentanyl could affect an individual’s ability to function in the labor force given the additional potency of illicit opioids and the associated health risks (e.g., due to higher rates of injection use). In addition, acquiring heroin may introduce individuals to illicit markets, which could have independent harmful consequences such as exposing them to criminal behavior or increasing risk of victimization. Heroin use – relative to prescription opioid misuse – could also increase the propensity to fail drug tests, hurting employment prospects. On the other hand, if reformulation induced some to stop misusing opioids entirely==== or reduced rates of initiation into opioid misuse, then we may observe beneficial outcomes.====At the market level, a broad transition from prescription opioids to heroin may cause illicit drug markets to expand beyond individuals previously misusing OxyContin. Drug market expansion could alter labor markets with general equilibrium ramifications on employment, induce crime, and systematically change population health. In the end, it is difficult to predict the effects of such a dramatic shift from prescription to illicit drugs since there is little evidence about what such an enormous transition will do to individual- and market-level behaviors.====We study changes in labor supply and disability outcomes in states with higher rates of OxyContin misuse before OxyContin reformulation relative to those with lower rates. Reformulation impacted the supply of abusable opioids nationally, but we exploit that states with higher rates of OxyContin misuse were more exposed to the effects of reformulation, comparing more exposed to less exposed states. Our primary empirical strategy transparently traces the relationship between OxyContin misuse and these outcomes in each year, conditioning on state and time fixed effects, while also accounting for the independent effects of pre-reformulation rates of pain reliever misuse more generally.====We observe large effects on labor supply and disability claiming. We estimate reductions in employment-to-population ratios in multiple data sets, beginning at the time of reformulation and growing over time. Additionally, we estimate even larger proportional reductions in hours worked, full-time work, earnings, and total employee compensation, suggesting important “intensive margin” effects as well. Moreover, the reductions in employment and full-time work are associated with decreases in health insurance rates. Our results also suggest that reformulation induced more people to apply for disability benefits, and many of these individuals met the SSA’s disability criteria and eventually received disability benefits. We estimate increases in disability applications, favorable determinations, and total beneficiaries. The differential rise in disability applications begins immediately after reformulation, and there is little evidence of any systematic pre-existing trends (or even level differences). The evidence is consistent with reformulation as the driving mechanism and not other policies or confounding factors resulting from the Great Recession.====Our results imply that a state with a one standard deviation higher rate of non-medical OxyContin use prior to reformulation experienced a 7% relative increase in disability applications after reformulation. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that the labor supply impacts of growth in illicit opioid markets are comparable to, but on the lower end of the distribution of estimated effects of, the consequences of legal opioid access increases found in the literature.====Although substance use disorders alone cannot be used as qualifying conditions for disability benefits, these results suggest that growth in illicit drug markets alters the labor market capabilities of those with other disabling conditions and/or worsens economic conditions for this population. The literature has provided evidence that economic conditions can drive application rates and alter the size of disability insurance rolls. This paper demonstrates that general equilibrium shocks to illicit drug markets can also affect demand for disability benefits.====We discuss these interactions further in the next section while also providing background on the reformulation of OxyContin. We describe the data used in the analysis in Section 3, and our empirical strategy in Section 4.

Using government data on specialty SUD treatment providers over the period 1997–2011 combined with a two-way fixed-effects model and local event study, we show that increases in the generosity of children’s public health insurance induce providers to participate in some, but not all, public markets. Our effects appear to be driven by non-profit and government providers. Non-profit providers also appear to increase treatment quantity slightly in response to coverage expansions.","This study offers evidence on substance use disorder (SUD) treatment provider response to public insurance expansions targeting children. These providers deliver care to patients, both children and adults, afflicted with SUDs – chronic conditions that impose costs on patients, their families, and society at large (Markowitz and Grossman., 2000; Terza, 2002; Carpenter, 2007; Balsa et al., 2009; French et al., 2017; Caulkins et al., 2014). SUD treatment received during childhood can alter substance use trajectories across the lifecourse, suggesting that studying factors that influence treatment receipt at this life stage is critical to promoting public health and reducing overall costs to individuals and society in current and future generations.====According to the American Psychiatric Association (2013), SUDs ‘occur when the recurrent use of alcohol and/or drugs causes clinically and functionally significant impairment, such as health problems, disability, and failure to meet major responsibilities at work, school, or home.’ Diagnosis is based ‘on evidence of impaired control, social impairment, risky use, and pharmacological criteria.’ In the United States, the focus of this study, 4% of children 12–17, or one million Americans, met diagnostic criteria for an SUD in 2018 (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2019) and millions more engaged in substance misuse. The U.S. is in the midst of an unprecedented substance use epidemic, with over 70,000 fatal alcohol poisonings and drug overdoses in 2017 alone (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019). Children are not immune to the epidemic, as rates of opioid misuse are alarmingly high among children as well: 21% of children 12–17 report having used prescription opioids, and 17.9% of that group (3.8% overall) report having misused them (Hudgins et al., 2019).====Childhood is a key developmental period for establishing health and human capital trajectories (Heckman, 2006). Many SUDs emerge during this period, and treatment at this time can have lifecourse benefits (Winters et al., 2011; Anderson, 2010; Kessler et al., 2005). Neuroscience research shows childhood is an important period of brain development in the prefrontal cortex, a region that is important for impulse control. Shocks experienced during this period – be they protective or harmful– can lead to persistent changes in the likelihood of developing an SUD (Clark et al., 2008).====Early intervention, in terms of treatment, could have long-term benefits for substance use, and overall health and well-being. Numerous SUD treatments are effective among children (Waldron and Kaminer., 2004; Tanner-Smith et al., 2013; Rowe, 2012; Jensen et al., 2011; Waldron and Turner., 2008; Hendriks et al., 2011; Dennis et al., 2004; French et al., 2008a, 2008b; Liddle et al., 2018; Neiderhofer and Staffen., 2003; Committee on Substance Use, 2016; Woody et al., 2008; Polsky et al., 2010; Matson et al., 2014; Perepletchikova et al., 2008). For instance, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as well as medications for treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD) have been shown to allow adolescent patients to enter substance use remission. Despite established treatment effectiveness, just 8.8% of children who needed treatment in 2018 received any SUD care in the past year (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2019).====A key barrier to SUD treatment-seeking is inability to pay and lack of insurance coverage, with over 30% of individuals who felt that they needed treatment but did not receive care reporting these barriers in 2018 (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2019). Expanding public insurance – which covered 41% of all children in the U.S. in 2017 (Kaiser Family Foundatuon, 2019) – may encourage children’s SUD treatment receipt. The extent of the response may be limited by the willingness of providers to accept this new coverage, whether for financial reasons or capacity constraints.====The covering of treatment costs may be valuable to low-income families whose children need care, as the average cost per child outpatient episode (which is generally less costly than inpatient treatment) is $3,073 in 2020 dollars.==== Because SUDs are chronic conditions, and relapse is common, many patients require multiple treatment episodes, adding to the financial burden experienced by low-income families with children with SUDs. Access to insurance that increases providers’ willingness to treat may allow children to initiate and continue needed treatments, and reduce family medical financial burden.====We apply the Sloan mixed-payer economy model to test the effect of children’s public insurance expansions on both the probability that a specialty SUD treatment provider accepts public insurance and the quantity of healthcare provided. Our analysis exploits expansions of public coverage to children ages six to 18 through state Medicaid programs and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) over the period 1997–2011, which we measure using the highest income threshold at which these children are eligible for public insurance in each state.==== The provider data that form the basis of our analysis are from the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS), which contains government data on the near-universe of specialty SUD treatment facilities in the U.S. A specialty SUD treatment facility is defined as a hospital, residential facility, outpatient treatment facility, or other facility with an SUD treatment program. Specialty care reflects 74% of non-self-help SUD treatment received by children (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2019) and 70% of U.S. expenditures on SUD treatment (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2016).====We have several findings. First, we establish the ‘first-stage’ effect: the insurance expansions we study increase public coverage and reduce uninsurance; we do not observe private coverage crowd out. Second, public insurance expansions increase the probability that a specialty SUD treatment provider accepts CHIP, but not Medicaid. Third, our effects are driven by non-profit and government providers, who represent 70% of the market; our evidence also suggests that non-profits treat additional patients upon expansion. Finally, public insurance does not influence the probability that a provider delivers charity care and does not crowd out other payment forms or other patients.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of Medicaid and CHIP, summarizes related literature, and reviews a mixed-payer model. Data, variables, and methods are outlined in Section 3. Our main results are reported in Section 4. Extensions to the main analysis and robustness checks are listed in Sections 5 and 6.

Fabel Marc,"ifo Institute for Economic Research and Munich Graduate School of Economics, Germany","Received 22 April 2020, Revised 3 January 2021, Accepted 6 January 2021, Available online 19 January 2021, Version of Record 29 January 2021.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2021.102431,Cited by (3),This paper assesses the impact of the length of ,"Over the last decades, family leave programs have been strongly promoted in large parts of the Western hemisphere. The average length of paid maternity and parental leave across all OECD countries rose from 14.0 weeks in 1970 to 55.4 weeks in 2016 (OECD, 2020). Leave policies allow parents to take a break from work and focus on child care. These leave schemes are based on evidence showing that the first year in a child's life is essential for subsequent child development (Currie and Almond, 2011). The impact of family leave schemes goes beyond protecting against job dismissal and compensating income losses. They have gained significant momentum as a policy tool in encouraging female employment (Blau and Kahn, 2013) and fertility (Lalive and Zweimüller, 2009), advocating for gender equality (Kotsadam and Finseraas, 2011), and safeguarding the well-being of mother and child (Bütikofer et al., 2021). To achieve these goals, the German Federal Ministry of Family Affairs is expected to pay 7.25 billion euros for parental leave in 2020.==== Previous literature examining the effects of leave schemes has focused on either short-run health or long-run educational attainment and labor market outcomes. However, evidence on the effect of family leave policies on children's health outcomes in the long-run remains scarce.====In this paper, I aim to fill the gap in existing literature by assessing the impact of the length of maternity leave (ML) on children's long-run health outcomes. My quasi-experimental design evaluates an unexpected expansion in post-natal ML coverage from two to six months, which occurred in the Federal Republic of Germany in 1979. The expansion came into effect after a sharp cutoff date and significantly increased the time working mothers stayed at home with their children during the first six months after childbirth. To estimate the causal effect of the length of ML on child health outcomes, I exploit the exogenous variation stemming from the reform, which provides a treatment assignment that is plausibly random. All previously employed women who gave birth on or after May 1, 1979 were eligible for six months of ML after childbirth. On the contrary, mothers who delivered their baby before the cutoff date were entitled to only two months of job-protected ML. In order to account for potential seasonal birth effects, I employ the following difference-in-differences approach: I compare health differentials between children born in the months before and after the implementation of the reform, with health differentials between children born in the same calendar months but in the previous year, when no legislative change took place.====I exploit German hospital registry data containing detailed information about the universe of inpatient cases for the years 1995 to 2014. By tracking health outcomes of individuals aged 16–35 who, as children, were (or were not) exposed to the reform, I find significant and robust evidence that the ML expansion improves children's health over the life-cycle. Children subject to the more generous leave scheme are on average 1.7 percent less likely to be hospitalized. The results are driven by fewer hospital admissions among men and are stronger for individuals in their late 20s and after. Additionally, using the diagnoses codes of hospitalizations, the results show that the largest driver for the decline in hospital admissions comes from a reduction in mental and behavioral disorders (MBDs). The effects on MBDs mirror the overall results well, particularly with respect to age and gender differences. MBDs not only bear the largest relative contribution in the reduction of hospitalizations but they also resemble the most frequent diagnosis type for individuals in the age group that are observed.==== Because of that importance in terms of effect size and prevalence, I exploit the fine granularity of the diagnoses codes and study the effect of the 1979 ML reform on subcategories of MBDs. I find that treated males experience fewer MBDs due to the use of psychoactive substances and fewer incidences of schizophrenia. These results are consistent with Canetti et al. (1997) and Enns et al. (2002) who show that parental bonding, in particular with the mother, is linked to the development of mental disorders later in life.==== The results are robust to alternative specifications of the dependent variable and the level of aggregation, different estimation approaches, and also various placebo tests.====In order to elicit the possible underlying channels of the relationship between the ML expansion and children's long-run health outcomes, I compare the impact of the reform on children's health outcomes in rural and urban areas, as mothers in urban areas had a higher propensity to work in 1979. The results show that the overall effects on hospitalization and MBDs are driven mainly by urban areas. A greater labor force participation implies that more mothers were eligible for ML and as a consequence, more children were affected by the reduction of maternal labor supply. Taken together, the results suggest that the reform had a larger impact on children's health outcomes in regions where there was a stronger reaction to the 1979 ML reform.====The notion that later-life outcomes originate from early childhood is not novel. Barker (1990) postulated that conditions in-utero and during infancy have long-lasting effects on later life health. Early experiences may influence adult physical and mental health in two ways (Shonkoff et al., 2009). On the one hand, there is a cumulative process at play, in which early experiences trigger a repetitive provocation of neurobiological responses that may become pathogenic. On the other hand, the environment during key developmental stages is biologically embedded into regulatory physiological systems such that it can impact adult disease and risk factors latently. In these sensitive periods, the developing brain's architecture is modified considerably and is particularly sensitive to environmental stimuli. In both cases, the effects of experiences made in early life may be latent initially until the onset of a particular condition.====My results show that the 1979 ML expansion entails benefits that were not at the heart of policy debates that surrounded its implementation. Yet, back-of-the-envelope calculations based on my estimates indicate that the health effects of the ML expansion are substantial. For instance, the reform leads, on average, to 370 fewer diagnoses of MBDs for one birth cohort per year. This implies health cost savings of about 6.6 million euros per birth cohort per annum, based on an estimated cost of 17,850 euros per MBD diagnosis.==== The effects on MBDs are particularly interesting as this disease category is the most prevalent among the age group under consideration (15–35 years). In addition, MBD inpatients have on average the longest length of stay in comparison with other disease types.==== For these reasons, MBDs are among the most expensive disease categories.====This paper complements various strands of the literature. At a very general level, it relates to studies that try to explain the role of early childhood experiences in later life outcomes.==== The majority of studies investigating the long-run impacts of ML, however, focus on human capital accumulation and labor market outcomes and typically have two common findings: positive effects of leave duration on child outcomes, or no effects at all.==== For instance, it has been documented that extending leave leads to higher cognitive skills (Albagli and Rau, 2018), better PISA test scores (Danzer and Lavy, 2017), lower drop-out rates from high school, and higher earnings of individuals when aged 30 (Carneiro et al., 2015). On the other hand, some studies have found no effects on children's test scores and the propensity to graduate from high school (Dahl et al., 2016), or on children's years of schooling, wages, and the likelihood of full-time employment (Dustmann and Schönberg, 2012). Second, this article relates to the literature on the impact of ML on short-run health outcomes. In contrast to the previous literature field, the results in this strand of the literature are less ambiguous. Expanding leave mandates have been shown to have a positive impact on children's health in the short-run.==== ML extensions improve infants’ overall health and reduce asthma rates (Bullinger, 2019), decrease the incidence of emotional disorders (Sayour, 2019), reduce the likelihood of early-term birth, and increase newborns’ birth weights (Stearns, 2015).====This paper aims at combining the above-mentioned two strands of literature by providing causal estimates of the length of ML on child health outcomes in the long-run. Two studies relate closely to this paper. First, Danzer et al. (2021) evaluate an Austrian reform from 1990 that increased paid and job-protected parental leave from 12 to 24 months. They find positive effects on children's disability status up to age 23 and fitness for military service (males only). Yet, they do not observe any effects of the Austrian reform on children's labor market outcomes. The authors also show effect heterogeneity by counterfactual mode of care. Their analysis demonstrates that the positive effects are driven by regions with no nurseries, i.e. regions where informal care is substituted with maternal care. Second, Ahammer et al. (2020) examine an Austrian reform from 1974, which expanded prenatal ML from six to eight weeks. They find no effect on outpatient expenses and hospital days for individuals in Upper Austria when aged 25–40.====The empirical analysis in this paper expands previous literature on several dimensions. In contrast to previous literature, this study is able to investigate the effect of a ML expansion on an unusually broad range of health outcomes. Using the universe of inpatient cases that were discharged from a hospital or rehabilitation facility, I examine the effects of the 1979 ML reform on the patients’ main diagnosis, which is coded according to the WHO's classification catalog. This way, I can investigate the effect of a ML expansion on many relevant disease categories. Moreover, the institutional setting of Germany and the data allow me to trace out the trajectory of health differentials across 20 years of children's adulthood (from age 16 up to age 35). The longitudinal structure of the data permits a long-run perspective as children and hence, differentials are allowed to develop over time.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. The next section provides information about the 1979 ML reform. Section 3 explains the data and variables. Section 4 discusses the empirical design. Section 5 reports results. Section 6 contains a discussion of the conceptual framework and mechanisms.

Our analysis indicates that these birth order differences in parental health investments are not driven by children's health endowments. Thus, we do not find evidence for compensatory behavior of parents. We discuss alternative explanations, such as the role of resource constraints. Furthermore, we show, that the initial health ==== extend into middle childhood. Later-born children show a better health status in school health checks, they consume less medication and are less often hospitalized.","A large body of literature reveals that first-born children have higher cognitive and non-cognitive skills, acquire more education, and receive higher earnings than their later-born siblings.==== Recent research also documents a link between birth order and parental behavior, as first-born children receive greater attention and cognitive stimulation in (early) childhood.==== The observed negative relationship between birth order and human capital outcomes seems to be driven by differences in parental behavior and not by biological differences (Kristensen and Bjerkedal, 2007, Barclay, 2015b, Black et al., 2018, Lehmann et al., 2018).====Existing evidence on the relationship between birth order and health is mixed. While this research documents that first-borns as adults are taller (Myrskylä et al., 2013), have superior cardio-respiratory fitness (Barclay and Myrskylä, 2014), a lower mortality risk (Barclay and Kolk, 2015), and better self-reported physical and mental health (Black et al., 2016), it also indicates that first-borns have a higher body mass index and are more likely to be overweight or obese and to have high blood pressure (Jelenkovic et al., 2013, Black et al., 2016).====At birth, first-born children are less healthy than their later-born siblings. They are more likely to be born preterm and with low birth weights, and their mothers are more likely to suffer from pregnancy complications (Brenøe and Molitor, 2018, Lehmann et al., 2018, Breining et al., 2020). Thus, the existing literature demonstrates that despite their disadvantages in terms of health at birth, first-borns as adults have better health in some dimensions, raising the question of whether health investment of parents is compensatory, i.e. they invest more in children with a lower health status.====The literature on birth order effects on parental health investment is not extensive. There is some empirical evidence that prenatal and postnatal maternal behavior favors first-born children. Mothers are more likely to attend prenatal care in their first pregnancy and are more likely to breastfeed the first-born child (Buckles and Kolka, 2014, Black et al., 2016, Brenøe and Molitor, 2018, Lehmann et al., 2018).====A theoretical model of health or human capital formation, provided by Almond et al. (2018), may help to interpret the existing literature. The health of a child is produced by an initial health shock (endowment) and subsequent parental investment. Parents choose health investment by maximizing a utility function containing consumption and the health of their child, subject to a budget constraint. In this model, the production technology of health affects the investment decision. If endowment and subsequent investment are substitutes in the production of health, the optimal level of investment is larger for children with lower initial health endowment, i.e. parental investment is compensatory.====The birth order literature suggests that children with lower birth order are less healthy at birth, and parental (health) investment is larger. Applying the above model, three distinct mechanisms may explain these empirical results. First, parents invest more in children with a lower birth order because their lower initial health endowment makes subsequent investment more productive. Thus, compensatory investment results from the production technology. Second, compensatory investment may also be driven by parental preferences, in particular, a low substitutability of child health in the utility function. The lower the level of substitutability of outcomes among children, the more likely parents compensate for initial inequality by investing more in the child with the lowest initial health status. Third, parents invest more in children with a lower birth order because of parental resource constraints. The share of resources (disposable income and time) that is allocated to a child decreases with the arrival of each further child. An earlier-born child receives a larger share of resources in the period before the next child is born (compared to the later-born child at the same age). The third mechanism differs from the first and the second in that birth order effects on parental investment are not the result of differences in health endowment.====In this paper, we analyze birth order effects on children's health status and parental health investment, and explore whether differences in investment are explained by health inequalities at birth or parental resource constraints. We use high-quality administrative micro-data from Upper Austria that allows a combination of health status with measures of parental health investments such as vaccinations, participation in public health screening programs, and primary care physician visits. Upper Austria is one of Austria's nine provinces and comprises approximately one-sixth of the Austrian population. Our data enable us to control for cohort effects and to exploit within-family variation in birth order that accounts for confounding family-level factors, such as genetic endowments, family background, completed family size, or maternal age at first birth.====Consistent with the literature, we find a statistically significant and quantitatively important health advantage for later-born children at birth. They are less likely to be born preterm, less likely to have low birth weight, and less likely hospitalized for perinatal conditions. As argued by Brenøe and Molitor (2018), later-born's superior health at birth can be explained by a biological mechanism that improves nutrient supply to the fetus with each pregnancy (Khong et al., 2003, Gluckman and Hanson, 2004).====We also find significant birth order differences in parental health investment. Earlier-born children are more likely to participate in preventive medical screenings, their vaccine uptake rates are higher, and they see their general practitioner (GP) or pediatrician more often. Each unit increase in birth order decreases health screening participation at age two by 4.1 percent. This birth order effect increases with the age of the child and amounts to 10.7 percent at age five. Vaccination uptake rates against measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) decline with birth order. Each unit increase in birth order decreases the likelihood that the child gets the vaccine by the age of two by 9.8 percent. Furthermore, we show that parents are less likely to visit a primary care physician, the higher the birth order of the child.====These birth order effects are not the result of differences in health at birth. Since controlling for health endowment does not change the estimated coefficients, compensatory parental behavior does not seem to be the main driver. We also analyze the role of parental resource constraints. Although we have no information on time and other resources available in a family, we use the number of children in the household at the time the investment decision is made (age-specific family size) as a proxy for parental resource constraints. This covariate provides information among how many children the resources have to be divided. The inclusion of age-specific family size in our regressions does not change the estimated birth order effects on parental health investment.====Finally, we analyze birth order effects on health in childhood. Based on data from primary school health checks, we show that later-born children have better health outcomes than their earlier-born siblings between the ages of six and ten. For instance, each unit increase in birth order decreases an index of identified health problems by 0.11 standard deviations. The effect is driven by the lower prevalence of ear, nose, and throat (ENT) problems, motor skill issues, and low physical activity. These results are complemented by an analysis of curative health care utilization until age ten. Children with a lower birth order are more likely to consume medical drugs and utilize inpatient medical services. The index of drug prescriptions decreases by 0.07 standard deviations and the index of hospitalizations decreases by 0.02 standard deviations with birth order.====Our results add to the literature on birth order effects on childhood health. Brenøe and Molitor (2018) use Danish registry data on inpatient and outpatient hospital admissions and emergency room contacts and demonstrate that the health disadvantage for first-borns decreases with age and becomes insignificant after age six. Björkegren and Svaleryd (2017) study birth order effects in Sweden, and use hospital admissions and mortality data to show that first-born children exhibit poorer health until age six, a disadvantage that is reversed (in some dimensions) in adolescence.====This paper offers two contributions: First, we provide estimates of birth order effects on parental health investment beyond the prenatal and postnatal periods, and discuss possible mechanisms that explain why these investments may decrease with birth order. Second, we complement recent empirical contributions by Black et al. (2016), Björkegren and Svaleryd (2017), and Brenøe and Molitor (2018). As adult health can be viewed as the sum of health endowment, parental health investment, and the individual's own health behavior in child- and adulthood, this study contributes to a better understanding of the complex relationship between birth order and adult health. Decreasing parental health investment with birth order may also explain part of the negative relationship between birth order and human capital outcomes. Moreover, our findings suggest that scope exists for social policy to offset these differences in parental behavior.====The remainder of this paper is as follows: Section 2 presents the institutional background, data sources, outcomes and estimation samples. Section 3 explains the estimation strategy, and Section 4 presents our estimation results. Section 5 covers the endogeneity of family size and Section 6 discusses further possible mechanisms and concludes.","Birth order, parental health investment, and health in childhood",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629621000114,9 January 2021,2021,Research Article,178.0

Proponents of these plans argue that high deductibles could reduce wasteful spending by providing ,"Healthcare costs in the United States (US) continue to rise, prompting providers, insurers, and policymakers to search for solutions to reduce spending without sacrificing quality of care (Hartman et al., 2018). Overtreatment has contributed to increasing spending and has been estimated to cost approximately $200 billion annually without contributing meaningfully to clinical well-being (The Healthcare Imperative, 2010) and thereby represents an opportunity to substantially reduce spending without negatively affecting patient health outcomes. Low-value health care use, a subset of overtreatment, is defined as spending on services that provide little to no clinical benefit and burdens patients with additional expenses and potential risk (Schwartz et al., 2014). Reducing low-value care use is seen as a promising way to bend the health care cost curve (Berwick and Hackbarth, 2012), however, efforts on this front have been hindered by several barriers. First, identifying which services are low-value given the multitude of clinical contexts is a difficult task that seldom results in unanimous agreement (Beaudin-Seiler et al., 2016). Second, even in instances where there is near consensus on services that constitute low-value care, changing provider and consumer behavior is further complicated by imperfect dissemination of information, patient preferences, medicolegal concerns, and other factors (Gawande et al., 2014; Umscheid, 2013).====One mechanism to potentially reduce low-value health care spending is the creation of demand-side incentives for patients to use care more efficiently through plan designs with greater cost-sharing for patients. In particular, there has been a recent trend in plans with higher deductibles. A deductible is a feature of an insurance plan which constitutes an amount of money that a patient must pay out-of-pocket every year before insurance begins covering expenses. In 2017, 28% of employees with employer-sponsored health insurance were enrolled in a high-deductible health plan – up from 20% in 2015 – as well as 90% of individuals covered through plans purchased from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act individual marketplace in 2015 (Claxton et al., 2016, 2017; Dolan, 2016). Proponents of high-deductible plans argue that the high-cost sharing associated with them will encourage consumers to shop around for lower prices, and consider the value of the services that they receive since they have skin in the game. On the other hand, critics argue that, as shown as early as the RAND Health Insurance Experiment, high-cost sharing will lead to broad reductions in care regardless of value (Manning et al., 1987). These indiscriminate reductions may result in adverse health outcomes if patients reduce their use of necessary services. Worryingly, this concern could be amplified for those of lower socioeconomic status (Chernew and Newhouse, 2008).====Two previous studies (Reid et al., 2017; Rosenthal et al., 2018) have explicitly examined the effect of high-deductible plans on low-value care use. Rosenthal et al. used cross sectional data with multivariable regression analysis and found no consistent relationships between high-deductible plans and low-value care use. Reid et al. used longitudinal data with a coarsened exact-match strategy between treatment and control enrollees and found that, while switching from a traditional health plan to a high-deductible plan was associated with decreased low-value spending relative to matched-controls, these reductions were proportional to overall reductions, suggesting that patients were not preferentially reducing low-value service use (Reid et al., 2017). However, both studies were unable to account for unobservable differences in enrollees that opted into high-deductible plans relative to those that stayed in traditional plans, resulting in concerns about selection bias. Understanding the causal effect of high-deductible plans on low-value care use is critical to understanding the role that demand side cost sharing plays in altering expenditures and targeting low-value care as a means to bend the health care cost curve.====The goal of this study is to estimate the causal effect of high-deductible plans on measures of low-value spending. The key empirical challenge of this analysis is the endogeneity of high-deductible plan enrollment. Selection into various health plans is endogenous and prior research has shown that high-deductible plan enrollees tend to be younger, healthier, and have higher income than traditional plan enrollees (Greene et al., 2006; McDevitt et al., 2014; Tollen et al., 2004). To address this issue, we follow two analytic strategies common in the related literature. In the first, we identify a set of employers that never offer a plan with a deductible over $500 (control group) and a second set of employers that began offering a plan with a deductible of at least $500 during our study period (treatment group). We then estimate the intent-to-treat effect of offering a high-deductible plan on mean annual enrollee spending. By analyzing the intent-to-treat effect of ==== a high-deductible plan, we can leverage the firm’s plausibly exogenous offer to eliminate any bias stemming from individual-level plan selection (Haviland et al., 2016). Second, we leverage the firm’s high-deductible plan offer as an instrument for enrollment in one of these plans, which allows us to estimate the local average treatment effect of enrolling in a high-deductible plan (Eisenberg et al., 2017).====Overall, we find that offering a plan with a high deductible results in reductions in enrollee spending on 24 outpatient low-value services. In particular, we find that a high-deductible plan offer causes a statistically significant decrease of 13.7% in spending on 24 low-value outpatient services, a significant decrease of 21.2% in spending low-value imaging service measures, and significant decrease of 22.2% in spending on low-value laboratory service measures. We find that, relative to reductions in overall spending for each of these categories (5.2%, 17.7%, and 13.6%, respectively), the magnitude of the reductions for low-value spending is significantly larger for outpatient and laboratory services. While no significant difference was found between the reductions in low-value and overall spending for imaging services, the point estimates are qualitatively larger for the low-value services.

In relative terms, the highest emigration rates are observed in small island nations and low-income countries, where needs-based deficits of healthcare workers are often estimated to be most severe. Over time, we identify rising trends in Caribbean islands, Central Asia and Eastern Europe. On the contrary, despite increasing migration flows to Western Europe, physician migration rates from sub-Saharan Africa have been stable or even decreasing. Our empirical analysis reveals that physician migration is a complex phenomenon that results from a myriad of push, pull, and dyadic factors. It is strongly affected by the economic characteristics of origin and destination countries. The sensitivity to these push and pull factors is governed by linguistic and geographic ties between countries. Interestingly, we find that the evolution of medical brain drain is affected by immigration policies aimed at attracting high-skilled workers. In particular, physician migration is sensitive to visa restrictions, diploma recognition, points-based system, tax breaks towards migrants, and the option of obtaining a permanent resident status.","The global shortage of health workers presents an increasing and palpable concern for governments and policymakers working to ensure the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for health (SDG3), which prioritize the need for universal and sustained access to health delivery, and the equitable distribution of health services for all are met by 2030. At the cusp of achieving these goals and improving health outcomes are a minimum threshold of physicians, nurses and midwives, and other health workers needed to support an effective healthcare delivery system. However, global disparities and shortages in the supply of healthcare workers exist, with high to severe shortages reported in many low and lower-middle income countries where the need for health workers is greatest.==== Central to the debate on health worker shortages is the emigration of health workers from developing to developed countries and their retention rates. The international migration of doctors in particular, has been an unwaning topic in the discourse of addressing the inequities in the distribution of human resources for health. This has heightened the need to empirically investigate from a policy standpoint, the geographical disparities in the supply of physicians worldwide and to understand the underlying factors causing these disparities.====This paper focuses on the magnitude and causes of physician migration, and presents an opportunity to advance our understanding of their trends, patterns, and drivers using new cross-country estimates. We construct a new data set that more than doubles the size of previous databases, and use it to make ==== to the existing evidence on medical brain drain. Firstly, we provide new and useful insights in the global migration of doctors, shedding light on the role of recent events such as the enlargement of the EU, the role of increasing training capacity in sub-Saharan Africa and on the establishment of offshore medical schools in the Caribbean. Secondly, we take advantage of the size of the database to empirically identify the multiple determinants of physician emigration decisions across many countries over a long period of time. Our rich data set allows us to deal with unobserved heterogeneity through the use of a great variety of dyadic, origin-time and destination-time fixed effects. Thirdly, we merge our migration database with recent dyadic and unilateral data on migration policies to assess the role and effectiveness of recruitment practices.====Our paper speaks to two strands of literature. It relates to the literature on high-skilled emigration and development. Much of the earlier literature on the brain drain maintained that the emigration of high-skilled workers in general, and medical doctors in particular, is a waste of talent and a direct fiscal loss for the sending country. The rationale is that doctors in developing countries are mostly trained for free using public funds (e.g., Bhagwati and Dellalfar, 1973, Bhagwati and Hamada, 1974). Notwithstanding, a growing body of literature argues that the emigration of physicians could induce beneficial effects in the form of greater incentives to acquire human capital (e.g., Mountford, 1997, Stark et al., 1997, Beine et al., 2001), remittances (e.g., Niimi et al., 2010, Bollard et al., 2011), and diaspora externalities (e.g., Kerr, 2008, Agrawal et al., 2011). Bhargava et al. (2011) find positive effects of emigration prospects on medical training, though the magnitude is too small for generating a net brain gain. The database developed in our study can be used in future works to assess whether these shortages have an effect on health outcomes and estimate any losses or gains to sending and host countries as a result of international migration.====We also contribute to the literature on the measurement of the medical brain drain and the analysis of its determinants. Our approach and findings can be positioned as following. In the ==== of the paper, we document the evolution of dyadic migration patterns of physicians from 192 training/origin countries to 22 destination countries over a 25-year period. This is the first data set we are aware of that provides an extensive longitudinal panel data to systematically standardize and quantify the absolute and relative sizes of the medical brain drain over such a long period of time. We build on previous data by Bhargava et al. (2011), which aggregates data on foreign-trained physicians from 18 destination countries (17 OECD member states and South Africa) for the period 1991–2004, by adding observations for 11 additional years (from 2004 to 2014) – and increasing the number of destination countries from 18 to 22.==== In that respect, our paper enhances the small but growing literature that has attempted to provide comparative evidence to estimate the size and intensity of the brain drain (Clemens and Pettersson, 2006, OECD, 2007).==== Our database thus provides new evidence to compare migration levels across countries, and to understand how the medical brain drain has evolved to include new corridors and sending sources; given recent key global economic shifts and bilateral country agreements over the last two decades or so.====We find that small island nations, low-income countries, and countries in the Caribbean and sub-Saharan Africa had the highest intensity of physician migration for the period between 2004 and 2014. These regions followed different trends. The Caribbean region experienced the highest emigration rates of physicians from 2004 to 2014; with average rates of migration of 24.0%; compared to rates of 17.5% over the 1990–2003 period.==== This is due to the growing number of islands that have “offshore” medical schools which train medical doctors from foreign countries. Increasing rates of migration were also observed for Europe and Central Asia (ECA) and Eastern Europe, which experienced more than double emigration rates due to the EU enlargement (from 2.9% in 2004 to 5.9% in 2014). Interestingly, sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), which had the second highest emigration rates of physicians experienced declining emigration rates between 2004 and 2014, due to increasing (albeit limited) training capacities.==== The most popular destinations of physicians are the United States and the United Kingdom, with new and emerging destination countries that include Germany, France, Sweden and Switzerland.====In the ==== of the paper, we provide an analysis of the determinants of physician emigration across many countries over a long period of time. Our analysis is embedded in the theoretical and empirical literature on push and pull factors influencing skilled workers including wages (as in Padarath et al., 2003), working conditions (as in Awases et al., 2003, Hagopian et al., 2004), and destination country characteristics (as in Docquier and Rapoport, 2012, Bezuidenhout et al., 2009). We quantify the effects of time invariant variables (language, distance, colonial ties, etc.), push factors (governance, public health and economic conditions, etc.), and pull factors (shortage of medical doctors, employment, income levels, etc.). The mechanisms by which host country immigration policies affect the emigration of doctors have not quite been established in the literature. This indicates the need to better investigate and understand how bilateral and unilateral policies of host countries influence the emigration of physicians globally.====Estimates from our empirical analysis of the determinants of physicians’ migration reveal the size and evolution of medical brain drain are complex phenomena that results from multiple push, pull, and dyadic factors. Origin-specific characteristics such as GDP per capita influence physician emigration. Training capabilities and governance are also important but less robust to the estimation technique. Given inertia in migration stocks, the long-run responses to changes in explanatory variables are 2.7 times greater than the short-run ones (observed within 5 years). As far as pull-factors are concerned, physician migration is more influenced by economic conditions (as proxied by unemployment rates and wage rates of high-skilled workers) than shortages of health care providers at destination. The sensitivity to these push and pull factors is governed by linguistic and geographic ties between countries. In particular, speaking the same official language increases the dyadic stock of physician migrants by 178% in the long-run which is more important than sharing colonial links.====In the ==== of the paper, we assess the role of migration policies influencing the global migration of high-skilled workers in general, and migration of doctors in particular. Based on previous work by Czaika and Parsons (2017), who provide a comprehensive assessment of 9 policies aimed at attracting high-skilled workers across 10 destination countries, we estimate how bilateral agreements and unilateral policies of host countries, including the ease of work and residency permits, and diploma recognition affect the emigration of medical doctors globally. For instance, what new insights might we gain from policies which agree on the mutual recognition of diplomas of professionals including doctors? Could recruitment practices by countries that introduce work permits as a requirement for all foreign medical graduates against a previously open door policy affect the attraction of medical doctors to countries with stricter immigration policy? An understanding of these policies may help policy-makers better project their human resources planning and staffing needs.====We find that the evolution of medical brain drain is affected by immigration policies aimed at attracting high-skilled workers. In the long-run, the dyadic stock of physician migrants increases by 132% when a destination country implements a points-based system, by 124% when it offers a path to permanent residency, or by 65% when tax cuts are targeted towards immigrants. In the same vein, removing dyadic visa restrictions or recognizing foreign diplomas increases the long-run stock by 54% and 28%, respectively. Overall, of the nine policy instruments we introduce to assess the role of immigration policy of destination countries in attracting physicians, we find that the implementation of points-based system and the ease of obtaining permanent residency in the destination country appear to be the most effective policies for attracting doctors.====The rest of our paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of our data sources. We then describe the current patterns and trends in the evolution of the medical brain drain in Section 3. Section 4 lays out the foundations of our empirical model and describes our results. We conclude with a discussion of our results and of their implications.","Medical brain drain: How many, where and why?",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629620310559,30 December 2020,2020,Research Article,180.0

Why do they experience the apathy of depression or inaction when trapped by multiple competing problems? We propose a framework for explaining these and other related behaviors based on the insight that individuals can only experience a limited number of latent stimuli to which they are exposed. We conduct an experiment to test this model and find that more than two thirds of the subjects behave consistent with our theoretical framework.","Economists have long been interested in why individuals engage in self-defeating behaviors. Such behaviors include seemingly myopic financial decisions, addiction, risky sexual behaviors, self-harm, and apparent apathy in response to the challenges of life. Behavioral explanations for these pervasive issues may include lack of self-control (Strotz, 1955), hyperbolic discounting (Thaler, 1981, Rachlin et al., 1991), and the cognitive strains of poverty (Ridley et al., 2020, Dean et al., 2019, Kremer et al., 2019). Some economists have modeled behaviors such as addiction as a rational choice in a setting with dynamic costs and benefits (Becker and Murphy, 1988).====We propose another framework for explaining these behaviors based on the insight that individuals can only experience a limited number of latent stimuli to which they are exposed. This is consistent with research in psychology suggesting that individuals can only attend to a very limited number of stimuli (Colin, 1953, Treisman and Gelade, 1980, McCaul and Haugtvedt, 1982, Borkovec and Roemer, 1995). Our model can explain a variety of seemingly dysfunctional behaviors including self-harm, the apathy of depression, and the inaction of individuals trapped by multiple competing problems. In addition, we provide an empirical test of the model in the lab and find that it can explain behavior of 68 percent of our subjects.====To understand the intuition underlying our model, consider an individual who is exposed to many latent stimuli but prone to experience only the most salient one. Suppose an individual is watching a movie, with a utility measure of 10, while experiencing a headache, with a utility measure of ====2. Suppose further that the movie and headache each have a subjective measure of salience, and that the individual only experiences the utility of the most salient stimulus.==== If the salience of the movie exceeds that of the headache, the individual does not notice the headache in the background and enjoys a utility of 10 from watching the movie. On the other hand, if the salience of the headache exceeds that of the movie, then the individual cannot pay attention to the movie and instead experiences the utility level of the headache, ====2. What are the behavioral implications of such a decision maker?====This framework has the power to explain a variety of interesting economic behaviors and phenomena. Naturally, this model predicts that individuals and firms will often bundle unpleasant stimuli with a more pleasant distraction (Filcheck et al., 2005, Milkman et al., 2014, Al-Khotani et al., 2016). Hence, individuals may listen to music while exercising or watch TV while prone in the dentist's chair. More significantly, however, the model rationalizes a number of seemingly dysfunctional behaviors as well.====First, consider health-related behaviors such as self-harm, risky sexual behaviors, or substance abuse. In our model, individuals may engage in such activities even if they are not intrinsically pleasurable in isolation. Suppose an individual is exposed to an emotionally painful event, perhaps due to poor mental health or a difficult interpersonal conflict. In this case, an individual may engage in cutting, not because the stimulus is pleasurable but rather because it has higher utility than the emotional suffering and is more salient. In this sense, it acts as an effective, if unpleasant, distraction from an even more painful stimulus. While the individual would prefer a pleasant distraction, there may not exist any pleasant experiences that are sufficiently salient to distract from the emotional suffering. In this sense, the self-harming behavior serves as a feasible optimal distraction.====Second, our model explains the behavior of individuals experiencing depression. We model depression as a very salient negative stimulus. Because depression is so salient, it crowds out the utility associated with activities that would normally be considered pleasant. Consequently, depressed individuals have little motivation to engage in a variety of activities associated with a functional life. Indeed, to the extent that the only stimuli sufficiently salient to break through depression are either risky or harmful, our model also explains why depressed individuals are at risk of illicit drug use, overeating, and self-harm.====Third, our model predicts that individuals experiencing multiple problems have a diminished incentive to fix any single problem. This is because the benefit of removing one negative stimulus is negligible if the individual is also experiencing another more salient negative stimulus. Even the benefit of solving the problem associated with the most salient negative stimulus is limited by the fact that removing the stimulus will simply bring another problem to the fore of the individual's attention. In this manner, individuals may appear apathetic about improving their situation in the presence of multiple problems. This can explain why stressed individuals act in a manner that seems self-defeating or why the poor make seemingly irrational decisions (Schilbach et al., 2016, Haushofer and Fehr, 2014).====We present empirical predictions of our model and test them in a laboratory setting. The key prediction is that an individual would always rank experiencing two stimuli simultaneously between the two stimuli separately. In particular, when the stimuli are undesirable, then the individual would rank two bad things as weakly better than just the worst of the two. We examine this in the case of subjects who are asked their willingness to endure listening to a painfully loud fire alarm, put a hand in ice cold water, or do both at the same time. Strikingly, we find that fully 68 percent of individuals weakly prefer to endure both negative stimuli compared to enduring just the most painful one. Of these, 13 percent have a strict preference. This is strong evidence suggesting our model is empirically relevant in explaining human behavior.====Our work relates to a growing body of research in health economics on rational addiction (Becker and Murphy, 1988, Darden, 2017, Darden and Papageorge, 2018) and studies in behavioral economics exploring the relationship between cognitive function and poverty-induced stress. Ridley et al. (2020), Kremer et al. (2019) and Dean et al. (2019) document robust causal links between poverty, psychological well-being, and economic behaviors. They describe a feedback loop in which poverty reinforces itself through reduced cognitive function. We contribute to this literature by presenting an additional explanation for why the poor and those in otherwise difficult circumstances often engage in seemingly irrational behaviors. We also contribute to prior empirical work in economics which has explored the relationship between self-harm behaviors and employment, income, and education (Hansen and Lang, 2011, Marcotte, 2003, Rodriguez Andres, 2006) as well as depression and mental health in contexts like fertility (Wilson, 2019), unemployment (Hakulinen et al., 2019, Tefft, 2011, Marcus, 2013, Green, 2011), crime (Mahuteau and Zhu, 2015), and human capital accumulation (Patton et al., 2016).====This paper also contributes to a long-standing literature in psychology, cognitive science and decision theory, which we discuss in detail in Section 3 below.",Rationalizing self-defeating behaviors: Theory and evidence,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629620310535,28 December 2020,2020,Research Article,181.0

I use information on monthly conflict incidents at the village level, which allows me to identify the effects of exposure to conflict more accurately than prior studies. I exploit the heterogeneity in conflict intensity across villages and ==== cohorts to document the impacts on adult stature and intergenerational health. I find that childhood exposure to conflict and, in particular, exposure starting in infancy, negatively impacts attained adult height. Each additional month of exposure decreases a women's adult height by 1.36 millimeters. The impacts are not limited to first-generation - I find that a mother's exposure to conflict in her childhood is also detrimental to her child's health. Mothers exposed to conflict during their childhood have more children and live in less wealthy households, likely reducing their ability to invest during their children's critical period of physical development.","The environmental conditions experienced ==== and in early life have profound influence on human biology and long-term health (Golden, 1994, Martorell et al., 1994, Forsdahl, 1977, Barker, 1992, Bateson et al., 2004, Gluckman et al., 2007, Gluckman et al., 2008, Maccini and Yang, 2009). Similarly, early life conditions have lasting and significant impacts on adult economic outcomes (see reviews by Strauss and Thomas, 2008; Currie and Vogl, 2013). These findings are highly relevant in the context of civil conflicts, which cause considerable human suffering, death and property destruction. Despite the potential for conflict to contribute to lasting health impacts, the empirical evidence on long-term and intergenerational effects of conflict on health is limited.==== Lack of conflict data at detailed geographic scale has made it difficult to measure precisely the consequences of conflicts.====In this paper, I investigate the impacts of early childhood exposure to Nepal's 1996-2006 civil conflict on women's final adult height and on second-generation health using the 2016 Nepal Demographic Health Survey (NDHS) and village-level variation in conflict intensity. By exploiting detailed geographic information on conflict incidents (village-level conflict intensity), I am able to identify the effects of exposure to conflict more accurately than previous research.==== The literature on the consequences of war, including in Nepal==== has mostly focused on conflict variation at a broader regional level (see Valente, 2014, Valente, 2015; Pivovarova and Swee, 2015; Akresh et al., 2012). Moreover, this study extends the literature on legacies of war by documenting the long-term effect of exposure to conflict on women's final adult height.==== Along with Akresh et al. (2018), which examines the impacts of the Biafran war using the variation in exposure to the war by ethnicity, this is among the first papers to document the intergenerational transmission of the impact of early childhood conflict exposure on second generation health.====Nepal experienced a decade-long violent civil conflict between 1996 and 2006, which resulted in more than 13,000 fatalities, destroyed considerable infrastructure, hindered delivery of basic services, and generated pervasive and strong feelings of fear, insecurity, and stress among its citizens. I use the Informal Sector Service Center's (INSEC) records of conflict victims to create a casualty-level data set with exact geographical locations (villages) and dates of incidents. I merge the village-level conflict intensity data with the 2016 Nepal Demographic Health Survey (NDHS), which is a nationally representative survey of the female population aged 15 to 49. I limit the analytical sample to women who were either born before or who were ==== at the start of the war in February 1996 to assess the lasting impact of conflict on height. In 2016, these women were old enough (20 to 49) to be sampled in the ever-married NDHS 2016 women sample and had documented survey responses about their children that can be used for second-generation analysis. Limiting the sample to women born before the conflict's start date also reduces potential confoundedness through selective fertility and migration (further discussed in empirical strategy section 4). I rely on the biomedical literature that height development in human beings is characterized by rapid growth during the first three years of life, followed by lower level of constant growth and then a secondary growth spurt during adolescence (Fig. A5), and classify women into three treatment cohorts, namely: ages 0 to 3, 4 to 8, and 9 to 15 at the start of the war in February 1996. While women in age cohort 0 to 3 would have been exposed to conflict throughout their entire three stages of growth, the age cohorts 4 to 8 and 9 to 15 would have been exposed only in their latter stages of growth. I define women ages 16 to 21 in 1996 as a comparison group because they would have passed their pubertal ages and attained full adult height by the time of the conflict's start in 1996.==== I also include women ages 22 to 29 as a second control group to validate parallel-trend dynamics in difference-in-difference specification.====This research makes two primary contributions to the literature on the legacies of war. First, using the variation in exposure to conflict, as measured by months of war, birth cohort, and village of residence, I find that conflict and, in particular, exposure starting in infancy, has a highly significant and negative impact on women's final adult height. Women in age cohorts 0 to 3 and 4 to 8 attain 1.36 and 0.71 millimeters lesser adult height due to an additional month of exposure to the civil conflict. Villages in the sample, on average, were 5.85 months under the civil war. Therefore, the overall height of women in these two cohorts are 8.0 and 4.2 millimeters less compared to women in the control group. Findings are robust across model specifications and measures of conflict. In validating the difference-in-differences estimation strategy used, I find no evidence of presence of non-parallel dynamics nor of selective migration and fertility. These result are important given increasing evidence of the lasting impacts of stunting and slow growth in height early in life on overall physical, biological and cognitive development, school achievement, economic productivity and maternal reproductive outcomes (see review by Dewey and Begum, 2011). Additionally, given the established literature on the existence of a height premium (Persico et al., 2004, Case and Paxson, 2008, Vogl, 2014, Bargain and Zeidan, 2017), the result has important economic meaning.====A second contribution: I find that the mothers’ exposure to conflict is detrimental for their children's health, especially child weight as measured by weight-for-height and BMI z-scores. As with the first generation impacts, the second generation results are robust to alternative measures of conflict intensity, including the one where I define a mother's exposure to conflict at her district of birth. I find strong evidence that the women exposed to conflict during childhood have more children and live in poorer households as adults. The combination of these two factors may result in meaningful decreases in parental ability to invest in children. Increased fertility, and, hence, burden of feeding more mouths may negatively affect children's health. However, other unobserved factors such as stress and genomic changes may also influence the intergenerational transmission.====This paper links to three important strands of economics literature. First, the established literature of ==== and early life shocks on adult outcomes (see review by Almond and Currie, 2011) and that insufficient or lack of parental investment during critical periods of child development can lead to irreversible damage (Cunha and Heckman, 2007). Second, the paper is related to the literature providing strong positive intergenerational human capital transmission (Currie and Moretti, 2003, Currie and Moretti, 2007, Almond et al., 2012, Justino et al., 2014, Bhalotra and Rawlings, 2013). Third, combine effect of the negative second generation health impacts and the result indicating increased fertility among the first generation points to the Becker and Lewis’s (1973) child quality-quantity trade-off hypothesis.====The reminder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the background on Nepal's civil conflict, major events that helped shape the war, and the physical and economic costs of the war. Conflict intensity from the INSEC's database and individual data from the 2016 NDHS are discussed in section 3. Section 4 presents empirical strategies for evaluating both the first and second-generation impacts.

Previous studies, which focused on the health effects of lottery prizes in Western European countries with strong social safety nets, do not find positive effects other than those on mental health. By contrast, the current study contributes to the literature by providing new evidence of the positive health effect of income via lottery wins in a country without strong social safety nets.","Estimating the causal relationship between income and health can assist policymakers to better design public cash transfer policies to improve public health. An increase in income allows individuals to afford more healthcare and other goods and services, and enjoy more leisure activities, thus enhancing health (Grossman, 1972). However, it can also induce engagement in risky health behaviors, such as smoking and drinking (Apouey and Clark, 2015; Van Kippersluis and Galama, 2014).====Despite its importance, it is difficult to uncover the causal relationship between income and health due to several empirical issues, including omitted variable bias and reverse causality (Cutler et al., 2012). As such, it is critical to employ a credible research design for causal inferences. The ideal approach to overcome this identification challenge is to randomly assign income to individuals. Such random assignment guarantees that individual characteristics are independent of the assigned income, and thus, on average, treated and control groups have the same observable and unobservable characteristics, except in the assigned income amounts. This research design allows researchers to interpret observed differences in health as the causal effects of income. However, it is often infeasible to implement such an experiment on a large scale due to high costs, especially in developed countries.====As an alternative approach to estimating the causal effects of income, a growing body of research has exploited lottery wins as a source of exogenous variations in income (Lindh and Ohlsson, 1996; Imbens et al., 2001; Lindahl, 2005; Doherty et al., 2006; Hankins and Hoekstra, 2011; Hankins et al., 2011; Kuhn et al., 2011; Apouey and Clark, 2015; Cesarini et al., 2016; Raschke, 2019; Fagereng et al., 2020; Lindqvist et al., 2020; Östling et al., 2020; Briggs et al., 2020). By construction, the possibility of winning a lottery prize and the amount of prizes won are randomly determined, conditional on lottery ticket spending. As such, lottery prize data allow researchers to cleanly identify the causal effects of unanticipated income changes.====We estimate the health effects of unearned income by exploiting random variations in income generated by lottery wins. We use data from the Singapore Life Panel (SLP), a nationally representative survey data of Singaporeans aged 50–70, for the empirical analysis. Singapore provides a useful context to study the effects of lottery wins on health because of Singaporeans’ avid playing of the lottery. For example, about 60% of SLP respondents of the SLP plays the lottery. It also recorded the largest spending per capita on lotteries globally in 2013 and 2017 (Markle et al., 2014, 2018).====Our results provide evidence that a S$10,000 (US$7,245 or €6196) increase in unearned income via lottery wins improves household members’ self-reported overall health status by 0.15 points (0.18 standard deviation, or SD) or increases the probability of reporting excellent, very good, or good health by 7.3 percentage points (0.15 SD).==== The estimates are about 30–40% smaller than the income-health gradients, implying that naive OLS estimates of the associations between income and health can overemphasize the importance of income for health. A heterogeneity analysis indicates that the estimated impacts appear to be larger among those with liquidity constraints.====We then examine the effects of lottery wins on comprehensive outcome measures such as healthcare spending, total household consumption spending (except for spending on healthcare and cigarettes), labor supply, psychological well-being, and cigarette spending to investigate possible mechanisms. We find little evidence that lottery wins increase healthcare or cigarette spending or that it discourages labor supply. Instead, we show that lottery wins increase total household consumption spending and improve psychological well-being.====This study contributes to the literature by providing new evidence on the health impact of lottery wins in a different context. Our finding that an increase in household (unearned) income improves older individuals’ health status is contrary to previous findings of no health effects from lottery wins (Apouey and Clark, 2015; Cesarini et al., 2016; Raschke, 2019; Östling et al., 2020) except for the results of Lindahl (2005).==== One suggested explanation is that an additional increase in income may not play a significant role in improving health in Western European countries, such as the UK, Germany, and Sweden, that operate strong social safety nets (Cesarini et al., 2016; Östling et al., 2020). By contrast, health effects could differ in other countries, such as Singapore, that emphasize individual responsibility and offered limited social assistance until recently (Choon, 2010; Haskins, 2011). These differences in the health effects of lottery wins across heterogeneous settings enable a more comprehensive understanding of the role of income in health.====This study also contributes to the literature by examining several potential mechanisms. Exploiting rich information of the survey data, we examine the relationships between lottery wins and medical expenditures, consumption spending, labor supply, subjective well-being, and risky health behavior measured by cigarette smoking. For example, consumption spending information is typically not available in administrative data. Although the previous studies using survey data, such as British Household Panel Survey, the Swedish Level-of-Living Survey, and the German Socio-Economic Panel, could investigate potential mechanisms, these studies could not control for ticket spending (Apouey and Clark, 2015; Lindahl, 2005; Raschke, 2019), which may have resulted in biased estimations, as Cesarini et al. (2016) points out. We overcome this limitation by directly controlling for lottery ticket spending.==== In addition, we conduct a variety of robustness checks, which may be useful for other studies using lottery prize data.====The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the data. In Section 3, we present our empirical strategy to identify the causal effect of unearned income via lottery wins on health.

The use of many drugs is illegal, often through outright prohibition or through age restrictions, as in the case of alcohol and tobacco. Even when legal many substances are heavily taxed, in part to discourage use. Moreover, potentially addictive drugs are often formulated in such a way as to discourage abuse. For example, the long-acting opioid Oxycontin was reformulated in 2010 so that it could not be crushed and snorted to deliver an immediate, potent dose. Although such policies may deter drug and alcohol use, they have potentially harmful unintended consequences. Taxing cigarettes encourages substitution towards higher nicotine-content products (e.g. Evans and Farrelly, 1998, Cotti et al., 2016). When Oxycontin was reformulated, both its use and misuse fell, but many users substituted towards heroin, and opioid-related overdoses skyrocketed (Alpert et al., 2018, Evans et al., 2019). Harmful consequences arise because these policies not only deter new users, but they also target inframarginal users, who end up either bearing higher costs or substituting to more dangerous substances. In this paper, we ask whether substance use policies can deter new users without causing harmful compensatory behavior.====We study the regulation of addictive substances among new users in the context of prescription opioids. Opioid use and misuse are major public health concerns, as reflected in the high and rising number of opioid-related deaths. Opioids were involved in roughly 47,500 deaths in 2017—1.7 percent of the national total, an increase of 9.6 percent since 2016 and over 300 percent since 1999 (Scholl et al., 2019, Ruhm, 2018). Although the U.S. drug overdose death rate had reduced in 2018 (the first reduction in 25 years), data for 2019 show an increase in death rates by 5 percent over the previous year. Rising mortality, combined with widespread use and misuse of prescription and illegal opioids, has been recognized as a crisis. Policy responses to this crisis have entailed attempts to thwart prescription drug misuse, mitigate harm, and improve access to treatment. Most state policies have been ineffective in reducing opioid prescribing, as Meara et al. (2016) show in their thorough analysis. An exception, however, is must-access prescription drug monitoring programs (MA-PDMPs), which require prescribers to check state databases of controlled substance prescribing before writing an opioid prescription. These laws reduce opioid use and, especially, tail outcomes such as doctor shopping (filling prescriptions from several doctors) and extremely high levels of use, as Buchmueller and Carey (2018) show in an influential paper. However, they may unintentionally increase crime and illicit drug use (Mallatt, 2017, Dave et al., 2018).====In this paper we focus on a set of recently-enacted policies specifically designed to prevent new users from becoming addicted to opioids. These are laws that limit the strength and length of opioid prescriptions for new users with acute, non-cancer pain. Only two states had such laws prior to 2011, but by the end of 2018, 26 states had passed initial prescription limits. The typical law limits an initial prescription for acute pain to seven days supply; prior to such laws, it was possible to write a prescription for 31 days or longer (Davis et al., 2019a). Policymakers had two specific motivations in passing these laws. First, they hoped to limit unintentional addiction among new patients, who diligently take their prescription, not appreciating the risks of developing opioid addiction. For example, former Ohio Governor John Kasich, stated that “by setting aggressive prescription limits, we’re taking big steps to prevent opiate addition from happening in the first place” (Kasich, 2017). Consistent with this concern, observational evidence indicates that the probability of becoming a chronic opioid user rises sharply in the length of the initial prescription (Shah et al., 2017). Second, large initial prescriptions create a stock of drugs available for diversion to non-prescribed users. Not all patients consume the entire prescription and policymakers hoped to reduce diversion possibilities by reducing the number of leftover opiates. Diversion of prescriptions is considered the source of drugs for a large fraction of current misusers (Lipsari and Hughes, 2017), and prior research shows state policies may reduce diversion (Surratt et al., 2014).====We evaluate whether state opioid policy can influence initial prescriptions, including both the hazard and intensity of new use. We estimate difference-in-differences models using health insurance claims data from a national commercial insurer. As our focus is new use, our sample is restricted to cancer-free, initially “opioid-naïve” patients, who had not filled an opioid prescription in at least the prior 12 months.====Our focus on new users is novel to the literature and there are at least two reasons to care about this group. First, while harm reduction among all existing users is important, reducing initiation is the most promising avenue to improving opioid use disorders in the longer run. Second, to the extent that opioids are addictive, it may be much harder to discourage existing users than to prevent new use, and efforts to discourage existing users may be more likely to induce substitution towards more dangerous illicit drug use.====Our claims data, which begin in 2007 and run through April of 2018, offer several advantages over previously used data to study opioid use and prescribing. Much of the prior research that has examined the effect of state laws has used state-level aggregate data on dispensed totals derived from DEA records or from Medicaid. It is not possible to study new users with these data, making it difficult to examine laws targeting initial prescriptions. Recent research has also used individual level Medicare claims data. Opioid use is common among Medicare beneficiaries, but those data give an incomplete picture of opioid use in the United States. Moreover, Medicare data are available generally with a 2-3 year lag, which makes it hard to study effects of state initial prescription limit laws.====We begin by describing the characteristics of new opioid use. Every month, about 1 percent of those with no prior opioid use fill an opioid prescription. Our first finding is that initial prescriptions are fairly short, only 6.4 days on average. Even in states without a limit on initial prescription length, 80 percent of initial prescriptions last for 7 days or fewer, and 91 percent are for 14 days or fewer; this is true even in the earliest years of our data.==== As the modal law limits initial prescriptions for acute pain to 7 days or fewer, there is therefore little scope for these laws to bite. Some laws impose tighter limits; however, we find that even in states with 3–5 day limits, initial prescriptions are often for longer than the statutory amount.====Our second finding is that, nonetheless, these laws work to reduce the length of the initial prescription. Initial limit policies reduce the probability of an initial prescription exceeding 7 days by 21 percent, and the laws reduce the average length of the initial prescription by about half a day. However, rather than reduce initial prescription length by reducing the frequency of long prescriptions, initial limit policies increase the frequency of short prescriptions. In particular, we find that the laws induce a 0.12 percentage point increase in the hazard of new prescriptions lasting 1–7 days. The laws also generate a 0.02 percentage point reduction in the hazard of prescriptions lasting longer than 7 days. The net effect, however, is a 8.7 percent increase in the hazard of new prescriptions, as well as an (imprecisely estimated) 9.6 percent increase in the total amount of opioids dispensed to new patients. These results suggest that initial prescription limits are ineffective in reducing opioids dispensed to new users. One possible mechanism for these surprising results is that physicians could interpret the initial prescription limits as signalling the safety or acceptability of short prescriptions.====While limits on initial prescriptions appear ineffective at reducing mean opioid consumption among new users, they could still reduce low-probability events such as dangerous levels of consumption or doctor shopping. We find no evidence to support this view. Limits on initial prescriptions are not associated with reductions in the probability of having high days supply, high daily dose, overlapping claims, or doctor shopping in the initial spell. We caution, however, that such extreme events may take many months or years to develop from the initial prescription, and these laws may be too recently passed to detect effects on these outcomes.====Overall, our evidence suggests that initial prescription limits have not been effective in their goal of reducing opioids dispensed in the initial spell. This finding complements contemporary work by Davis et al. (2019b) and Lowenstein et al. (2019). Davis et al. show that initial prescription limits do not affect overall opioid dispensing, but they do not examine new users, the targeted group. Lowenstein et al. examine outpatient clinics in New Jersey and Pennsylvania and find, like we do, that initial prescription limits reduce the average length of new prescriptions, but they do not consider the extensive margin. Our results, which use national data, show that, rather than reduce the rate of long prescriptions, these laws largely increase the rate of short prescriptions.====Although initial prescription limits appear ineffective at reducing new opioid use, other state prescribing policies that were pursued during these years may be more effective. We therefore also examine the impact of MA-PDMPs on new use. These policies are important to study because they were widely implemented in recent years, reduce dangerous use among existing users, but may induce substitution towards illegal substances. Reducing use among new users would be an important benefit. We find that MA-PDMPs indeed deter new use, decreasing the hazard of initial prescriptions by about 4.7 percent. However, like initial limit policies, they have no impact on markers of dangerous use among new enrollees in the short run. These finding are novel to the literature, which has not considered the impact of MA-PDMPS on new use.==== Overall, our findings suggest that initial prescription limits may not be particularly effective for reducing new use, but that MA-PDMPs may be even more influential in affecting opioid prescribing than previously thought, as they reduce both new as well as extreme use.",Can policy affect initiation of addictive substance use?

According to Betrán et al. (2016), the largest increase in c-section rates has occurred in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), where it went from 27% in 2000 to 42% in 2014. Recent studies in several countries suggest a correlation between delivery at for-profit private hospitals and c-sections (for example, see Hoxha et al., 2017). Fig. 1 shows that both deliveries at private hospitals and c-section rates have increased in recent decades in Chile.====If the correlation between deliveries at private hospitals and c-sections is causal, then the increase in c-section rates may be due to physician or hospital incentives rather than any change in medical conditions presented in pregnancy. This deserves attention given the extensive evidence that non-medically indicated c-sections are detrimental to the health of mothers and newborns (see Card et al., 2018, Costa-Ramón et al., 2018 or Borra et al., 2019, for recent examples).====The literature on physician and hospital incentives has focused on the ==== to perform more c-sections, i.e. the physician or hospital receiving higher fees for a c-section than a vaginal delivery. A seminal paper in this literature is Gruber et al. (1999) and more recent examples are Allin et al. (2015) or Foo et al. (2017). In this paper, we analyze a demand-smoothing mechanism: the scope to schedule of c-section deliveries, which is absent for vaginal deliveries. This flexibility may allow hospitals to schedule more deliveries and increase aggregate profits via a ==== even without price incentives. Therefore, we study whether this demand-smoothing mechanism can explain, at least in part, the high c-section rates of private hospitals when direct price incentives are not present.====To answer this question, in Section 2 we exploit a 2003 policy change in Chile that decreased the cost of delivery at private hospitals for women with public health insurance. Crucially, under this program, insurance pays private hospitals the same fee per delivery regardless of whether it is a vaginal delivery or a c-section. Using a difference-in-differences (DID) strategy exploiting the eligibility conditions for the program, related to insurance affiliation, we find that the policy increased the probability of delivery at a private hospital by 14.5 percentage points and the probability of a c-section by 8.6 percentage points.====After we show evidence that private hospitals perform more c-sections than public hospitals even without price incentives, in Section 3 we introduce a model of hospital decisions about the mode of delivery to understand the logic of the demand-smoothing mechanism. We model a profit-maximizing hospital receiving the same price for vaginal and cesarean deliveries, with the latter having a higher cost. However, while the hospital can schedule a c-section for a given period, a vaginal delivery arrives randomly either in the present or future period.====The model predicts that, at the margin, when the hospital increases the share of deliveries allocated to c-sections, the total number of deliveries increases (====). This effect in equilibrium compensates for the higher margins of vaginal deliveries (====). We conclude that, if vaginal deliveries have sufficient variation over time, a higher c-section rate may allow the hospital to more than compensate for the cost difference and to increase profits.====To quantify the importance of the demand-smoothing mechanism, we calibrate an extended version of the model with data and perform counterfactual experiments. The experiments suggest that constraining private hospitals to the c-section rate of public hospitals would decrease the capacity utilization of the former by 24% and reduce their profits by 12%. We then use the calibrated model, together with data on capacity utilization before and after the policy, to study if the demand-smoothing mechanism can explain, at least in part, the observed behavior in the c-section rates of PAD hospitals. The model replicates the positive correlation between changes in utilization and changes in c-section rates, providing further evidence that our proposed mechanism may be behind some of the effects of the policy.====Consistent with the demand-smoothing mechanism, in Section 4 we provide evidence that hospitals with higher c-section rates are more likely to reschedule a delivery when its due date (at a gestational age of 40 weeks) is expected to be a high-demand week. In particular, we find that the probability of an early-term birth (on week 37 or 38) is an increasing function of the expected demand at term (calculated as the number of deliveries that would have reached week 40 at the same time). This relationship holds only for private hospitals participating in the program, or hospitals with c-section rates above 40%.====Finally, in Section 5 we discuss our results and other possible mechanisms that may relate c-sections with physician/hospital incentives.====Our paper fits within the literature that have linked c-sections with price incentives (Gruber et al., 1999), fear of liability risk (Dubay et al., 1999; Currie and MacLeod, 2008; Frakes and Gruber, 2020) or procedural skill (Currie and MacLeod, 2016). Our work is also related to research on the effects of the type of hospital on c-section rates. For example, Johnson and Rehavi (2016) compared c-section rates for HMO-owned hospitals and non-HMO-owned hospitals for physician and non-physician patients, using data for California from 1996 to 2005. They found that c-section rates for non-physicians are lower in HMO-owned hospitals than in non-HMO-owned hospitals, while c-section rates for physician patients do not depend on hospital ownership.====This paper makes two main contributions. First, it demonstrates that a policy that increased access to private hospitals for women with public insurance had the unforeseen consequence of increasing the c-section rate. Second, our results suggest that hospitals/physicians have incentives to have a high c-section rate despite having a lower unit margin. Our results imply that future health policies may consider incentives other than price when designing contracts or payment systems.",A demand-smoothing incentive for cesarean deliveries,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629620310572,11 December 2020,2020,Research Article,185.0

In 2014, roughly eight million people purchased coverage through a government-run Marketplace. For many of these individuals, a significant feature of the ACA included Premium Tax Credit (PTC) subsidies that offset the cost of insurance premiums. These subsidies constitute about 50% of the cost of the ACA and approximately 25% of all IRS refundable tax credits. At the same time, there has been extensive debate in the policy sphere over whether elements of the ACA, including these tax subsidies, have come at the cost of reducing economic activity, including labor supply (e.g. CBO, 2014; Mulligan, 2015).====In this paper, using data from the population of tax returns, we evaluate the extent to which taxpayers responded to the large notch in the subsidy schedule where individuals lose eligibility. The PTC was only available to purchasers of Marketplace health insurance with modified adjusted gross incomes (MAGI) at or below 400% of the Federal Poverty Line (FPL), and falls to $0 for those with MAGI above 400% FPL. This sharp discontinuity, or notch, created a large incentive for those participating in the Marketplace to decrease their MAGI. Because notches create a dominated region of pre-tax earnings at levels just above the notch for which after-tax income is below the amount that would be attained right at the notch, one would expect to see excess mass in the income distribution at income amounts below the notch, and missing mass in the dominated region. To the extent that people achieve reduced MAGI by limiting hours of work or turning down additional self-employment activity, such a notch could lead to diminished economic activity. The notch could also lead to tax avoidance whereby taxable income is lowered through the use of (contemporaneous or ex post) deductions to retain eligibility for the subsidy.====Our paper is one of the first to study the effect of the tax subsidy schedule generated by the ACA, and more broadly, to document behavioral responses to income incentives in the ACA. Focusing on 2014, the first year the subsidy was available, we first provide graphical evidence of bunching at the 400% FPL notch. We find that taxpayers bunched at incomes below the notch, and that this bunching was concentrated among those who purchased health insurance on the Marketplace. (This result is particularly striking among exogenously selected samples that are more primed to be exposed to the incentive to lower their MAGI.) Scaling our bunching estimate derived from the overall population by the share of taxpayers in the Marketplace implies that the notch induced taxpayers with Marketplace coverage to be roughly 200% more likely to earn income below the notch than the counterfactual distribution of taxpayers with no notch. While the amount of bunching among those in the Marketplace is large in an absolute sense, it is small relative to the median and mean size of the notch (about $500 and $1800).====We next examine subsamples of the population to understand heterogeneity in the response and decompose possible mechanisms. Following past literature (e.g. Kleven and Waseem, 2013) and given the small share of taxpayers in the Marketplace, we limit our sample to Marketplace participants for this analysis. This examination is suggestive in nature given that the availability of a subsidy creates an incentive to sign up for subsidized insurance, which could introduce selection bias when focusing only on the Marketplace purchasers, though we find little evidence in practice that this type of sorting is biasing our estimates relying on the population of Marketplace participants.==== Among this population, we find that a majority (88%) of taxpayers whose income would have fallen in the dominated region of the distribution (i.e., their after tax income would be higher with a lower income) fail to bunch to avoid the loss in subsidy, implying the presence of significant optimization frictions, such as rigid work schedules that prevent taxpayers from adjusting their hours to locate below the cutoff. Consistent with the existence of such frictions, we detect larger response among those with larger predicted subsidies and somewhat larger responses among those who received an advance on their subsidy, used a paid preparer, or lived in a neighborhood with a higher concentration of PTC claimants (i.e. examples where adjustment costs may be lower).====Finally, we explore how taxpayers may have reduced their MAGI to avoid losing their PTC. We develop a method that exploits the panel nature of the data to test which margins of response are generating the bunching, which could in theory differ in their welfare implications (e.g. tax avoidance versus labor supply). Overall, we find that ex-post contributions to Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) can account for approximately 30% of the response, with the remainder appearing to stem from earned income, including lower wages. Thus, contrary to previous literature looking at the ACA and its specific features, we find suggestive evidence that the response generated by the PTC notch was potentially driven in part by a labor supply response.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the related literature and gives details on the premium subsidies provided by the ACA. Section 3 describes the data, and Section 4 outlines our empirical strategy. Section 5 examines bunching around the notch in the full population and in subgroups. Section 6 probes the mechanisms behind the observed bunching.

This effect is particularly pronounced for those over the age of 65. The findings suggest that low emission zones can be an effective way to reduce air pollution and improve health.,"Traffic accounts for more than one quarter of ambient air pollution in urban areas (Umweltbundesamt, 2018). Direct user charges, congestion pricing, license plate based restrictions, and low emission zones have become popular tools to reduce traffic-induced pollution (Davis, 2008, Wolff, 2014, Simeonova et al., 2018). Policies that aim to improve air quality primarily target population health: pollutants such as particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, and ozone can exacerbate already existing medical conditions, and in some cases even cause them. Despite the considerable attention paid to the traffic and pollution effects of air quality policies, their effectiveness in improving population health remains underexplored.====This paper studies the effects of one particular regulatory instrument, namely low emission zones (LEZs), on air pollution and cardiovascular health. LEZs are designated areas that restrict cars’ access based on their emission class. Since 2007, multiple cities in Europe and specifically in Germany have gradually been introducing such zones. Across countries and cities, LEZs vary in their operating hours and the restrictiveness of their vehicle exclusion. LEZs in Germany are among the most restrictive, as they impose a 24/7 ban on all days, and the restrictions apply to all vehicles, with few exemptions. The rollout started in 2008 after it became clear that most major cities were not in compliance with the EU Air Quality Standards. In Germany, LEZs were introduced in three phases, with each phase excluding an additional emission class of vehicles. The rich temporal and spatial variation in the implementation of LEZs combined with their restrictiveness generates a compelling natural experiment to evaluate their impact.====To study the effect of LEZs on air pollution and cardiovascular health, I exploit the variation across space and time in the introduction of LEZs in German cities using a difference-in-differences design. I use air pollution measurements from the German Environment Agency covering the period 2004–2016. I focus on two criteria pollutants: particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 10 (====) and nitrogen dioxide (====), as vehicle exhaust is a dominant source of their emission.==== I supplement the analysis with data from the Federal Motor Transport Authority for the years 2008–2017 to examine the impact of LEZs on the car fleet composition as a potential channel through which LEZs may reduce air pollution. To evaluate the impact on health, I use novel administrative outpatient care data from the universe of patients in the German statutory health insurance system during the period 2009–2017. I complement the outpatient data with evidence from a 70% random sample from German hospital diagnosis statistics for the years 2004–2014.====I find that LEZs reduce monthly ==== concentrations by 2–3%. The reductions in monthly ==== concentrations are smaller in magnitude and often less precisely estimated. These effects corroborate the findings from previous evaluations of LEZs in terms of their effect on air pollution (Wolff, 2014, Malina and Scheffler, 2015, Gehrsitz, 2017). I further show that a likely channel through which LEZs affect air quality is by reducing the share of cars with the highest emissions in the treated cities.====By improving the air quality, LEZs also improve population health. Findings based on outpatient data suggest that the number of patients with cardiovascular disease decreases by 2–3%. Consistent with epidemiological studies, age and disease subgroup analysis shows that the effects are particularly strong for those above the age of 65 and for cerebrovascular diseases (7–12.6%). Event study plots show that changes in health outcomes occur roughly in parallel to changes in ====. Using complementary data from the Leibniz Institute for Economic Research (RWI), I further show that socioeconomic characteristics within LEZs do not change systematically over time compared to control areas, suggesting that estimates are not driven by compositional changes. Multiple robustness tests, such as the use of different control groups, sample restrictions, different definitions of outcome and treatment variables, and falsification checks suggest that the results are not sensitive to these alternative specifications. Findings from the hospital admission data also suggest a drop in the number of people admitted with cardiovascular disease, but with less precisely estimated point estimates.====Several epidemiological studies highlight the adverse association between air pollution, in particular ====, and cardiovascular health (Linn et al., 2000, Pope, 2000, Tsai et al., 2003, Brook et al., 2004, Wellenius et al., 2005, Franchini and Mannucci, 2007, Fiordelisi et al., 2017). This negative relationship can be observed even at levels below commonly applied concentrations thresholds. Notably, it is combustion-derived particles, and not atmospheric ones that carry hazardous compounds on their surface and are especially toxic (Mills et al., 2009). There are two main ways that particles trigger a health impact: they can cause a systemic inflammation or can translocate directly into the circulation. Regardless of the pathway, the inhaled particles trigger a range of biological responses, such as elevated heart rate, blood pressure, and heart variability, which cause the onset of cardiovascular symptoms.====Cardiovascular disease generates the highest costs in the German health care system and is the leading cause of deaths worldwide.==== The studies on the link between ==== and cardiovascular health consistently show the strong association between ==== and heart disease, and in recent studies, particularly between cerebrovascular disease (Cesaroni et al., 2012, Lee et al., 2014, Hong et al., 2002, Tsai et al., 2003, Wellenius et al., 2005, Lisabeth et al., 2008, Stafoggia et al., 2014). Cerebrovascular disease is especially interesting, as it is the second leading cause of mortality and the leading cause of morbidity (Leiva et al., 2013). Studies also show that the burden of cardiovascular risk from pollution exposure mainly falls on the elderly and individuals with pre-existing chronic medical conditions (Hong et al., 2002, Brook et al., 2010, Wellenius et al., 2005).====The adverse association between pollution and cardiovascular health can be observed both in the short term and in the long term. The evidence for the short-term link comes from episode and time series studies, showing that variations in air pollution are paralleled by changes in cardiovascular admissions and deaths, which are observed between a few hours and two days (Pope, 2000, Wellenius et al., 2005, Fiordelisi et al., 2017). Long-term exposure studies usually evaluate health outcomes across geographical area with different levels of average pollution over longer time periods. These studies evaluate the effects of persistent exposure as well as the cumulative effects of repeated variations in average pollution levels and find robust association between exposure and disease incidence (Pope, 2000, Stafoggia et al., 2014).====This paper contributes to the existing literature in several ways. First, despite the rich evidence available on the direct link between pollution and health, less is known about the general health effect of policy instruments targeting air pollution. This paper builds on this strand of literature by providing evidence on the effectiveness of low emission zones (LEZs) as a policy instrument. A concurrent working paper by Pestel and Wozny (2019) also analyzes the effects of LEZs in Germany. The authors find that LEZs reduce the number of circulatory and respiratory diagnoses among hospitals whose catchment areas have proportionally larger LEZ coverage. The present paper and the working paper by Pestel and Wozny (2019) differ in their empirical approaches, which is partly driven by the differences in the data used. Pestel and Wozny (2019) use data derived from hospital quality reports. Based on hospital location, the authors overlay its catchment area with LEZ coverage to compute the share of hospital catchment areas treated by the policy, since the quality reports do not provide information on patients’ place of residence. Combining outpatient and hospital data allows me to show that it may be challenging to estimate precise treatment effects based on hospital data. I use individual-level hospital admission data, which contains information on patients’ place of residence at the city level. I find that while effects point toward decreases in the number of hospital admissions, the coefficients are not precisely estimated. Supplementing the analysis with outpatient data, which allows me to locate patients’ place of residence at the postal code level, I show a significant drop in the number of patients with cardiovascular disease. Encouragingly, both papers find that LEZs reduce the number of cardiovascular disease. My findings on respiratory disease, however, suggest that the number of patients with this diagnosis has not changed significantly.====A second important contribution made by this paper is linked to the fact that most of the existing literature focuses on infant and children's respiratory health, while only a small number of papers also examine the effect on the elderly.==== In an earlier evaluation of LEZs, Gehrsitz (2017) finds no effect on infant health. Two further studies use policy-induced variation to look at infant health by exploiting electronic toll collection in New Jersey and Pennsylvania (Currie and Walker, 2011) and childhood asthma by exploiting congestion pricing in Stockholm (Simeonova et al., 2018). This paper augments the literature by providing evidence for cardiovascular disease for the entire population and for the elderly. The elderly are of particular interest here because of their susceptibility to and the prevalence of circulatory system diseases.====Third, most studies evaluating the effect of air pollution on health use temporal variations in pollution levels over a short period of time (typically a day or a week), which allows them to estimate the impact of immediate exposure, but provides little information on long term exposure effects.==== This paper adds to the small number of existing studies analyzing the effects of long-term marginal reductions in pollution in a setting with relatively low pollution levels (Gehrsitz, 2017, Simeonova et al., 2018, Alexander and Schwandt, 2019). The nature of the present natural experiment and the availability of the rich and novel data over a long period enables me to evaluate health effects up to eight years after the policy was introduced. Furthermore, the national annual average level of ==== in Germany was around 23 ==== in 2007 before the rollout of LEZs. Typical background concentrations of ==== range between 20 and 50 ==== in developed countries and increase to between 100 and 250 ==== in developing countries (Mills et al., 2009).====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: the next section provides the background on LEZs in Germany and Section 3 describes the data. Section 4 discusses the findings of this study for air pollution and car fleet adaptation. Section 5 presents the main results and Section 6 discusses the identification threats and the robustness checks.

A key question for public policy is whether interventions delivered during early-life can counteract the negative effects of low weight and poor health at birth. For example, investments in additional medical care could generate substantial social benefits by enhancing later-life economic self-sufficiency and reducing reliance on social programs.====This paper provides new evidence on the effectiveness of early-life interventions for children born with birth weight below the 1,500 g (3 pounds and 5 ounces) threshold for Very Low Birth Weight (VLBW) status. Prior research has studied this question using a regression discontinuity (RD) design that exploits changes in hospital treatment across the VLBW threshold. Almond et al. (2010) find that children in the U.S. born just under 1,500 g have higher hospital costs and lower one-year mortality rates. Using data from Chile and Sweden, Bharadwaj et al. (2013) find similar results and show that children with birth weight just below 1,500 g have 0.13 to 0.22 standard deviations higher test scores measured during elementary and high school grades.====We build on previous studies using comprehensive administrative data from Rhode Island. The data contain over three decades of birth records that we join to a range of outcomes for education and social program participation. We study academic achievement throughout primary and secondary public education, as well as college attendance. We also examine enrollment in social programs and total benefits received during childhood. To explore post-hospital investment mechanisms, we use measures of parental behavior such as records on maternal labor market activity and school choice.====We find significant and large positive impacts of crossing the 1,500 g VLBW threshold from above on educational outcomes at all levels. Children born just under 1,500 g perform 0.34 standard deviations better on test scores measured during grades 3–8 relative to those born just above the threshold. For each grade throughout childhood, we find similar magnitude impacts, suggesting that factors influencing higher academic performance accrued prior to enrollment in school. These gains in test scores are matched by significant and positive effects on post-secondary educational enrollment. Threshold crossing is associated with a 17.1 percentage point (32 percent) increase in the likelihood of enrolling in any college by age 22.====There are also significant threshold crossing effects on the amount of social program expenditures that a child received. We measure spending using payment records for SNAP and TANF, claims files from Medicaid, and school data on enrollment in special education programs (IEP). By age 14, children born just under the 1,500 g threshold receive $66,997 ==== in social program expenditures. This is a large reduction relative to $145,486 spent on children born above the threshold. As another comparison, Almond et al. (2010) estimate that hospital costs increase by an additional $4,000 for children just under the 1,500 g threshold.====Given the size of estimated impacts relative to the in-hospital expenditures, we analyze two types of potential post-hospital mechanisms. First, we examine proxies for parental behavior using maternal employment records and responses to the Center for Disease Control’s Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring Program System (PRAMS) survey. We find no significant impacts on employment or earnings for mothers within the first two years after birth. Similarly, we find no significant impacts on measures for maternal care and stress based on the PRAMS survey. Although imprecise, the point estimates suggest that, if anything, threshold crossing increases care and reduces stress for mothers.====Second, we study whether threshold crossing affects school choice by creating value-added measures for public schools in Rhode Island. For elementary and middle school grades, we study school value-added for standardized test scores. For high school grades, we study school value-added in terms of enrollment in college. We find small, insignificant impacts of crossing the 1,500 g threshold on measures of school quality. The results suggest impacts on academic achievement are not driven by parents selecting substantially better schools.====The results are robust to standard regression discontinuity checks for balance in baseline characteristics across the 1,500 g threshold and tests of the sensitivity of our estimates to higher-order polynomial RD specifications. In addition, we address concerns about non-random heaping at the VLBW threshold by excluding observations within a small window around the 1,500 g threshold (Barreca et al., 2011). Finally, we show that our results do not appear to be affected by differential survival rates (or other forms of attrition) around the VLBW threshold. In our sample, we find little evidence of significant threshold crossing effects on the likelihood of having a test score or enrolling in high school.====Overall, our findings add to the literature on the effectiveness of early-life interventions and medical treatments for at-risk children. We extend Almond et al. (2010) by showing positive impacts on long-run measures of human capital and reductions in social program expenditures throughout childhood. The impacts on childhood test scores are consistent with findings for Chile and Norway reported in Bharadwaj et al. (2013).==== The effect sizes that we detect are also similar in magnitude to experimental and quasi-experimental evaluations of the test-score impact of early childhood education programs (Duncan and Magnuson 2013).==== Our results more generally contribute to the literature demonstrating that interventions delivered in early-life can generate notable gains for children (Currie and Thomas, 1995; Chetty et al., 2011; Havnes and Mogstad, 2011; Heckman et al., 2013; Chetty et al., 2016; Hoynes et al., 2016; Chyn, 2018; Bald et al., 2019).",The returns to early-life interventions for very low birth weight children,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629620310468,4 December 2020,2020,Research Article,188.0

Using Chinese historical data, we examine the impact of extreme weather on long-term human mortality in an environment where individuals had no access to modern technology. By combining life-course data on 5000 Chinese elites with historical weather data over the period 1–1840 AD, we find a significant and robust negative impact of droughts in childhood on the longevity of elites. Quantitatively, encountering three years of droughts in childhood reduces an elite's life span by about two years.","Climatic conditions affect human societies, a thesis that can be traced back to Baron de Montesquieu if not earlier. Modern technology provides myriad new means of foraging, clothing, housing, irrigation, and migration, all of which have revolutionized the lifestyle of human beings and their defense against climate change. The interconnection between climate and human societies has been extensively studied, as reviewed by Carleton and Hsiang (2016) and Dell et al. (2014). Little is so far known about the relationship between climate change and human society in the pre-modern era.====In this study, we turn to historical China in order to understand how extreme weather affected the longevity of human beings when they had no access to modern technology. China, as one of the oldest civilizations in the world, remained an agrarian economy until the 1950s. China barely made progress in its industrialization until it received technological transfers from the Soviet Union. Western immigration and trading with Western countries were tightly restricted in China until the First Opium War (1839–1842). In this pre-modern social context, extreme weather recorded by civil servants of the Chinese Empire provides us with a natural experiment setting which is devoid of modern technologies that can help mitigate the effects of severe weather.====We examine the longevity of five thousand elites who lived between the year 1 AD (the first year of the Gregorian calendar) and the year 1840 (the year when Britain forced trade openness upon China). The life-course data on the elites were originally compiled by Chinese historians as a biographical encyclopedia. The included elites (predominantly male) are high-profile government officials, army generals, monks, artists, writers, poets, and social celebrities. The choice of whom to include in the encyclopedia was made by historians based on individual prominence in Chinese history. The compiled life-course data on elites enable us to calculate their longevity. Further, combining the life-course data with historical records of extreme weather events makes it possible to identify the extreme weather encountered by the elites over their lifetime.====We find that exposure to droughts in childhood reduced longevity. Quantitatively, having three years of exposure to drought reduced longevity by about two years. In comparison, floods demonstrate a similar but weaker effect, while snow-related disasters and low temperatures show no such effect. In addition, early-life economic conditions were a possible channel for the childhood drought effect. By merging data on extreme weather with data on historical real GDP per capita for China, we find some suggestive evidence that up to a half of the childhood drought effect on longevity is related to the economic output per capita reduced by droughts.====As mentioned earlier, this study adds to the recent climate economics literature. Human beings adapt to weather by selecting and using suitable technologies, an endogenous decision that should be taken into account when researchers examine the impact of weather on human society. With incrementally large and rich micro-level data available to researchers, powerful econometric tools have been used for estimating the effect of climate on human society, including Hsiang (2016), Carleton et al. (2019), Deschênes and Moretti (2009), Deschênes et al. (2009), Deschênes and Greenstone (2011), Graff-Zivin and Neidell (2014), and Hsiang and Jina (2014) (see Hsiang (2016) and Auffhammer (2018) for reviews). The historical Chinese, as human beings without modern technology but having reasonably rich life-course records, have not been scrutinized in the climate economics literature. They offer a fresh perspective with regards to controlling for technological adoption and adaptation in the analysis of climate-related health outcomes.====Our work is closely related to the literature on the impact of early-life economic conditions on late-life health outcomes. As reviewed by Almond and Currie (2011a,b), Currie and Vogl (2013), and Almond et al. (2018), a deprived childhood has been extensively shown to impair one's health in adulthood. Droughts (Cutler et al., 2007 Dinkelman, 2017, Arthi, 2018, Duque et al., 2019, Hyland and Russ, 2019), floods (Maccini and Yang, 2009, Comfort, 2016, Abiona, 2017), and famines (Meng and Qian, 2006, van den Berg et al., 2006, van den Berg et al., 2009, van den Berg et al., 2016, Chen and Zhou, 2007, Lumey et al., 2007, Song, 2010) in childhood have adverse consequences for one's adult health prospects. The subjects in our study are individuals who had the most abundant socioeconomic resources in their cohorts and thus had the best means for alleviating the negative effects of disasters. It is likely that the childhood drought effect is even stronger for their historical contemporaries in the general population.====The impact of early-life conditions on late-life health has also been studied in medicine, public health, and epidemiology, even though the research interest in those disciplines is distinct from ours. Abnormal temperature has been found to result in elevated risks of death (Gasparrini et al., 2015) and hospitalization (Deschênes, 2014). In epidemiology, the Barker Hypothesis (or fetal origins hypothesis) posits that chronic, degenerative conditions of adult health, including heart disease and type 2 diabetes, may be triggered by circumstance decades earlier, ==== nutrition in particular (Almond and Currie, 2011a, Almond and Currie, 2011b). Life-course epidemiology was built on the premise that various biological and social factors throughout life independently, cumulatively and interactively influence health and disease in adult life (Kuh and Ben-Shlomo, 1997, Ben-Shlomo and Kuh, 2002). The epidemiological perspective informs our empirical approach of examining how extreme weather exposure in childhood affects longevity, where we study the contribution of early-life factors while accounting for late-life factors across the life course.====Lastly, our study contributes to a better understanding of population economics in historical China. China did not start collecting nationwide age-specific mortality data until the 1970s (Banister and Preston, 1981). Studies on China's historical population usually relied on genealogies (Lee et al., 1994, Zhao, 1997, Shiue, 2016, Shiue, 2017) or colonist records (Jia, 2014a.b). We introduce a new data source that features a long time span and a narrow but detailed focus. de la Croix and Licandro (2015), who use the IBN database to examine the relationship between elite longevity and the industrial revolution, argue that the longevity of historical elites is of tremendous importance in the study of economic growth because the human capital of their time was heavily concentrated in them. This argument applies to our context as well. Moreover, the elite class of China was at the center of the millennium-long Chinese imperial regime. Their role as the sources of stability and instability in the empire has been recently unraveled (Bai and Jia, 2016).====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a description of our data, including its sources and background. In Section 3, we explain our identification strategy. In Section 4, we report our empirical results, robustness checks, and replications using alternative datasets.

Using 100 % ,"A large share of health care spending goes towards unnecessary, low-value care (Berwick and Hackbarth, 2012). Reducing unnecessary care is a major goal for policymakers concerned about the financial health of the Medicare program. Providers who bill Medicare for unnecessary care are guilty of fraud (if they know treatment is unnecessary) or abuse (if they do not). Historically, the Department of Justice did not take legal action against hospitals and physicians that submitted claims for unnecessary services. Department prosecutors focused on more blatant forms of fraud, such as filing claims for fictitious patients. More recently, the Department has pursued a number of cases under the False Claims Act against providers accused of providing unnecessary care (Howard, 2020). Entities that are found guilty under the Act of submitting “false” claims to the federal government are liable for steep fines. Individuals may be imprisoned (for example, Kentucky cardiologist Richard Paulus recently reported to the medium security prison in Beckley, West Virginia to begin serving a five year sentence for billing Medicare for unnecessary percutaneous coronary interventions [James,2019]).====The impact of False Claims Act litigation is typically characterized in terms of penalties and settlements. For example, the Congressional Budget Office scores policies to enforce antifraud statutes in health care assuming they will generate savings of $1.5 for every $1 invested, where the $1.5 represents direct recoveries (Congressional Budget Office, 2014). Deterrence effects are acknowledged but unquantified. False Claims Act cases that address unnecessary care may have particularly large deterrence effects, especially those that focus on costly, frequently-used treatments.====Application of the False Claims Act to unnecessary care is controversial. Some defendants and their attorneys argue that cases amount to little more than courts “second guessing” physicians’ treatment decisions. In light of concerns about the False Claims Act litigation over unnecessary care and Medicare spending on unnecessary care more broadly, quantifying these effects is important for evaluating the role of the False Claims Act in combatting overuse. In this paper, we quantify savings to Medicare from a False Claims Act investigation into the overuse of implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs).====ICDs have been available since the 1980s but were rapidly adopted during the 2000s as a treatment to prevent cardiac arrest. In 2009, 141,000 ICDs were implanted (Hammill et al. 2010) at a lifetime cost of $80,000-$100,000 per patient (Sanders et al. 2005). Trials have identified several groups of patients who do not benefit from ICDs and, given the risk of infection and inappropriate shocks, may in fact be harmed (Voigt et al. 2010; van Rees et al. 2011). Medicare declared in 2005 that it would not pay for ICDs in these patients, but hospitals routinely billed for and received reimbursement for ICDs implanted in these patient groups. In 2007, the Department of Justice opened an investigation into the use of ICDs in patients who did not meet Medicare coverage criteria. The Department of Justice ultimately settled suits against 450 hospitals for $280 million.==== To isolate the impact of the investigation, we evaluated trends in the number of non-covered ICD procedures relative to trends in the number of covered, appropriate ICD implantations.The ICD case stands out in terms of the number of hospitals involved and the total dollar value of the settlement, but other cases have yielded larger settlements on a per provider basis, such as those against Health Management Associates ($260 million) and Prime Health Care ($65 million) for unnecessary hospital admissions and RehabCare Group ($125 million) for unnecessary rehabilitation services. What makes the ICD case useful for quantifying deterrent effects is that we can clearly identify unnecessary ICD implantations in our data.====Our paper adds to the small but growing literature on health care fraud. Most work in the field addresses more blatant forms of fraud, such as submitting claims for non-existent patients (for example, Hennig-Schmidt et al., 2019, Li et al., 2008). Nicholas et al. (2019) show that non-white, disabled, and low-income Medicare beneficiaries are more likely to be treated by Medicare providers subsequently excluded from the program for fraud and abuse. Nicholas et al. (2020) find that patients treated by these providers have worse outcomes.====Of more direct relevance to our work, Becker et al. (2005) estimated the impact of Medicaid anti-fraud spending, which varies by state and year, on the costs and treatment of Medicare patients with conditions prone to abuse. They argued that state Medicaid investigations would affect the treatment of Medicare patients if there was sufficient overlap in the types of providers and care targeted. They found effects for some subgroups of Medicare patients, but, overall, effects were small and/or non-significant. The results suggest that deterrence effects are small or that state Medicaid investigations tend to focus on Medicaid-specific issues. Leder-Luis (2019) calculates cost savings resulting from changes in practice patterns following False Claims Act cases related to unnecessary hospital admissions and botox administrations. He finds that the ratio of medical cost savings to settlements recovered is over 9, indicating that there are large deterrence effects.====Also related to our paper is work describing how the malpractice liability influences treatment decisions (Frakes and Gruber, 2019, Frakes, 2013;2016; Shurtz, 2013) and, in particular, the interaction between the malpractice system and reimbursement incentives (Bertoli and Grembi, 2019, Shurtz, 2014). Shurtz (2014) developed a model illustrating how the malpractice system counteracts reimbursement incentives. When reimbursement is high, malpractice liability may curtail overuse if overuse causes injury. Under the False Claims Act, overuse itself, not injury from overuse, triggers liability.====Using data on the population of inpatient and outpatient procedures in Florida, we identify medically necessary versus medically inappropriate ICD procedures. We then evaluate the impact of the Department of Justice investigation on the volume of these procedures. All hospitals were exposed to the investigation, and so we cannot take advantage of a control group of hospitals to identify its impact. Instead, we measure trends in the volume of non-covered ICD procedures relative to the volume of covered ICD procedures, thereby accounting for secular trends. According to our preferred specification, the Department of Justice investigation led to a 22 % decline in the use of non-covered ICD procedures. The associated reduction in Medicare spending over a ten-year period, $2.7 billion, is much larger than the amount recovered in settlements ($280 million). Not all cases targeting unnecessary care will be so profitable from the government’s viewpoint, but results suggest that deterrence effects are large and that antifraud enforcement has a useful role to play in reducing waste in the health care system.",Deterrence effects of antifraud and abuse enforcement in health care,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629620310511,27 November 2020,2020,Research Article,190.0

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) calls the opioid crisis “the worst drug epidemic in US history” (Kolodny et al., 2015). Between 1999 and 2017, overdose deaths from opioids, including prescription opioids and illegal opioids, increased six-fold.==== To contain the epidemic, federal and state governments implemented various policies that limit access to prescription opioids to reduce addiction, and several studies show that these drug control policies did reduce prescription opioid abuse (e.g., Buchmueller and Carey (2018); Cicero and Ellis (2015); Grecu et al. (2019)). Additionally, deaths from prescription opioids decreased by more than 4% between 2011 and 2013 and have remained relatively steady since then. These decreases, however, were limited to prescription opioids. During the same period, deaths from illegal opioids, such as heroin and illicitly made fentanyl, began to increase sharply, and between 2011 and 2016 they more than tripled. As a result, overdose deaths from opioids, including both prescription and illegal opioids, steadily increased between 1999 and 2017 and grew faster in the last few years, as shown in Fig. 1. The worsening epidemic sparked a debate about the effectiveness of supply-side interventions: do policies that limit access to prescription opioids cause users to transition from prescription opioids to illegal opioids?====I study whether and to what extent a supply-side intervention can have a spillover effect on illegal opioid use, focusing on prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs), one of the most widely adopted statewide drug policies. A PDMP is a state-operated database of patient prescriptions for controlled substances. Authorized providers can access the PDMP database to identify the inappropriate use of pain medications. From the pre-1990s to 2016, all but one state implemented PDMPs (which I refer to as voluntary-access PDMPs). However, because provider access was voluntary, only a small percentage of providers actually enrolled in the program or requested patient prescription histories (PDMP Center of Excellence, 2014). From 2010 to 2012, the median PDMP registration rate of licensed prescribers who prescribed at least one controlled substance prescription was only 35%. (Kreiner et al., 2014).====In response to the low participation rates, 16 states implemented a must-access provision between 2007 and 2016, in addition to the existing voluntary-access PDMP. Must-access PDMPs legally require providers to use the PDMP before prescribing or dispensing controlled substances under certain conditions. Kentucky's mandate on enrollment and PDMP use was associated with about an 8.5% lower overall dispensing of controlled substances in the first year following implementation, showing that mandates can effectively improve PDMP use (Substance Abuse, 2017).====However, by making prescription opioids less accessible, must-access PDMPs may lead individuals to switch from prescription opioids to illegal opioids such as heroin or illegal fentanyl. For example, 94% of opioid-addicted individuals who switched from prescription opioids to heroin reported doing so because prescription opioids “were far more expensive and harder to obtain” (Cicero et al., 2014). Given that heroin is affordable and easily accessible, the policy may have caused a significant transition from nonmedical use of prescription opioids to heroin use.====Using the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) Multiple Cause of Death mortality files from 2003 to 2016, I exploit the variation in overdose deaths involving heroin or other types of opioids resulting from PDMP laws. The heroin mortality rate has been widely used by researchers studying heroin use (e.g., Alpert et al. (2018); Evans et al. (2019); Kilby (2015); Meinhofer (2018)). I also use administrative data from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to quantify how must-access PDMPs affected the legal supply of opioids and to account for the confounding effect of the OxyContin reformulation on heroin death rates. The OxyContin reformulation of 2010 was a nationwide drug policy aimed at reducing opioid abuse and is potentially a strong confounder.==== Following the approach suggested by Alpert et al. (2018), I control for the differential effects of the reformulation across states by adding to my econometric model a measure of pre-reformulation OxyContin use interacted with the half-year fixed effects. I include this interaction in my preferred specification to address potential omitted variable bias that can arise from the pre-existing correlation between implementation of must-access PDMPs and exposure to the OxyContin reformulation.====I find strong evidence that must-access PDMPs increased heroin death rates. Using a difference-in-differences specification that allows the treatment effect to vary over time, I show that the heroin death rate began to increase in the year of policy implementation, and the size of effects steadily grew over time.==== My estimates indicate that two years after implementation, must-access PDMPs were associated with 0.9 more heroin deaths per 100,000 in a half-year period, relative to control states. I graphically present my difference-in-differences estimates and show that the trends in heroin mortality were not different across treatment and control states prior to implementation, providing evidence in support of the parallel trends identifying assumption.====Moreover, I find that the increase in heroin mortality coincided with a sudden decrease in prescription opioid mortality and a decrease in the legal supply of opioids following policy implementation, suggesting that the policies caused opioid users to transition from prescription opioids to heroin. My estimates suggest that even if must-access PDMPs reduced prescription opioid deaths, the decrease was offset by an increase in deaths from illegal opioids, including heroin. Overall, I show that must-access PDMPs had no substantial effect on total opioid-related deaths in the short term because of these offsetting effects.==== In the longer term, however, the policies were associated with increased total opioid deaths because the large increase in illegal opioid deaths surpassed the decrease in prescription opioid deaths.====The findings of this paper add to the literature on the spillover effects of PDMPs on heroin use. Most previous papers in this literature focus on the period before 2014 and find weak or no effects of PDMPs on heroin-related outcomes. Earlier studies are unable to distinguish between voluntary- and must-access PDMPs (e.g., Radakrishnan (2015); Nam et al. (2017)), and some prior work use survey or treatment admissions data, which are likely to underreport heroin use, and find no effects (e.g., Radakrishnan (2015); Ali et al. (2017); Grecu et al. (2019)).==== Kilby (2015) finds only a temporary effect of voluntary-access PDMPs on heroin mortality. Using data through 2013, Meinhofer (2018) finds suggestive evidence that must-access PDMPs increased heroin-related overdose deaths, although these findings are sensitive to the model specification.==== My paper contributes to this literature by providing robust, causal estimates of the medium-term effect of must-access PDMPs on heroin-related mortality. Two key innovations allow for this contribution. First, I utilize data through 2016, allowing for the inclusion of several additional must-access PDMP implementations and a longer post-treatment period. My findings suggest that estimating the longer-run impact is crucial to identifying the effect of must-access PDMPs on heroin-related deaths.==== Second, I demonstrate that the results are robust to controlling for other co-occurring state and national opioid-related policies. By employing more recent data than prior work, I am able to include several more reforms in the analysis that allow me to flexibly account for potential confounding effects of state and national opioid-related policies.====This paper also contributes to the literature on the unintended consequences of supply-side drug policies. Evans et al. (2019) and Alpert et al. (2018) investigate the consequences of the 2010 OxyContin reformulation and find strong evidence of the movement from legal opioids to heroin. My findings add to this literature and suggest that a supply-side intervention that controls access to legal opioids can have the unintended consequence of increased illegal drug use.====The results of this study have clear policy implications: the existence of accessible and affordable close substitutes may reduce the effectiveness of supply-side drug policies. A supply-side intervention can control only the legal supply of opioids but not the demand for opioids. Demand-side interventions, such as improving access to treatment or prevention may be more effective in preventing and mitigating opioid abuse and should be aligned with the existing supply-side policies.",Must-access prescription drug monitoring programs and the opioid overdose epidemic: The unintended consequences,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629620310547,26 November 2020,2020,Research Article,191.0

Our results indicate that being subject to the MLS penalty in a given year increases the probability of ==== private hospital insurance by between 2 to 3 percent in that year. If subject to the penalty permanently, this probability grows further over the following years, reaching 13 percent after a decade. We also find evidence of a marked asymmetric effect of the MLS, where the effect of the penalty is about twice as large for individuals becoming liable compared with those going from being liable to not being liable. Our results further show that the mandate has a larger effect on individuals who are younger.","Many countries use financial incentives to encourage the take-up of private health insurance (Colombo and Tapay, 2004). Perhaps the most notable example in recent years is the US's Affordable Care Act (ACA), which uses a mix of premium tax credits and a tax penalty for not having insurance — the “individual mandate” — to increase private health insurance coverage. Another important example is Australia, which since the late-1990s has taken a “carrot and stick” approach that incorporates subsidies and penalties (Hall et al., 1999). The “carrot” consists of premium subsidies, initially targeted at low-income households, but soon replaced with a universal 30 percent premium rebate. Two types of “sticks” are used to incentivize take-up. One is an entry-age rating scheme, known as Lifetime Health Cover, which requires higher premiums for people who first purchase private insurance at an older age. The second is the Medicare Levy Surcharge (MLS), a tax on high-income Australians who choose not to purchase private insurance.====Overall, these policies, which were first implemented between 1997 and 2000, appear to have been effective. Between 1999 and 2001, the percentage of Australians with private insurance increased from 31 percent to more than 45 percent. However, because they were implemented within such a short period of time, it is difficult to disentangle the independent effects of the different policies. Several early studies attribute most of the coverage increase to the Lifetime Health Cover policy. There is no consensus in this literature on what effect, if any, the premium subsidies and the MLS had (Butler, 2002, Frech et al., 2003, Palangkaraya and Yong, 2005, Ellis and Savage, 2008).====When the MLS was established in 1997, it applied to single individuals with incomes above $50,000 and families with incomes above $100,000. Households with incomes above these thresholds that did not purchase private insurance covering hospital care were subject to a 1 percent tax surcharge on their ==== income. Because these income thresholds were not indexed for inflation, over time more and more Australians were subject to the MLS. For the 2008–09 financial year, the thresholds were increased to $70,000 for single individuals and $140,000 for families, causing a significant reduction in the number of people subject to the policy. Starting that year, the thresholds were also indexed for inflation.====Only one prior study has attempted to estimate the independent effect of the MLS on private health insurance coverage. Stavrunova and Yerokhin (2014) apply a regression discontinuity model to cross-sectional tax data of single Australians from 2007–08, just before the change in the MLS income thresholds. The analysis is complicated by tax avoidance behavior that results in a bunching of reported income just below the MLS threshold and by the fact that marital status is not accurately measured in the tax data. They find a significant discontinuity in private insurance coverage at the threshold. Their results suggest that the MLS increased the aggregate private insurance coverage rate among single individuals by 2.4 percentage points.====In this paper we examine the effect of the MLS on private health insurance coverage, using a different empirical strategy that exploits changes in MLS liability arising from both year-to-year income fluctuations and the change in the MLS threshold policy in 2008. Our analysis is based on longitudinal data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey from 2004 to 2013. In addition to allowing for a different source of econometric identification, these data allow us to focus on important but hitherto unexplored issues in the empirical literature on the effects of policy incentives on health insurance demand.====First, there is evidence from a number of different contexts that consumers tend to maintain the same health insurance choices even as factors that influenced their original choices change.==== The longitudinal feature of HILDA allows us to estimate dynamic panel data models that account for such persistence. Our main econometric specification includes both individual fixed effects, to account for persistence that is driven by time-constant preferences and circumstances, and lagged values of the dependent variable, to allow for demand dynamics.====Persistence in the decision to buy health insurance shapes the response to mandates and can therefore have important consequences for policy design. If demand is persistent, estimates from models that ignore dynamics are not fully informative because they do not convey any information about the duration of the policy effect and its trajectory over time. These estimates represent some weighted average of individual treatment effects at a certain point in time after implementation of the policy, and it is not possible to infer if the estimates represent a temporary or long-lasting effect. In contrast, our dynamic model allows us to estimate the effects of either transitory or permanent changes to MLS liability. We present two simulation experiments that illustrate the different aggregate effects that would arise from temporary or permanent changes in the MLS policy.====Another limitation of analyses based on cross-sectional data is that they implicitly assume that the effect of becoming subject to the MLS penalty is the same (in absolute value) as the effect of becoming not liable. Although this assumption of symmetric effects follows directly from a basic economic model of utility maximization, a growing body of research applying insights from behavioral economics finds that many consumer health insurance decisions deviate from the predictions of such a model.==== As we discuss below, in the case of the MLS, there are several reasons to expect that the effect of becoming liable for the penalty will be larger than the effect of becoming not liable. With panel data, we are able to test this prediction.====A final advantage of the HILDA data relative to administrative data is that it includes proxies for individual health risk. Using these variables, we test for heterogeneous policy effects by conducting separate analyses for lower- and higher-risk individuals. Stratifying the data in this way sheds light on whether the MLS mitigates the problem of adverse selection by keeping lower-risk consumers in the market. Such an effect is a key rationale for insurance mandates.====Results from our main specification indicate a small but statistically significant initial effect of the MLS. Being subject to the MLS penalty increases the probability of purchasing private hospital insurance by between 2 to 3 percent that year. Due to state dependence, the probability is estimated to increase over the following years if the individual remains liable for the MLS penalty; for instance, an initial increase of 2 percent grows to an effect of almost 13 percent after a decade. We use our estimates to simulate the yearly share of Australians with private health insurance cover under two hypothetical alternative policies. We consider what would have happened had the MLS liability thresholds not been adjusted in 2008, as well as what would have happened if the MLS had been abolished altogether. The latter policy affects individuals’ MLS liability permanently; under the former, affected individuals’ liability can be more transient. While the share of the population affected by both experiments is roughly the same, we find that after five years the effect of the permanent change in MLS liability is over twice as large (in absolute value).====Other results suggest that the effect of the policy is asymmetric: becoming liable for the tax penalty initially increases private coverage by 3.5 percentage points, whereas going from being liable to not being liable is associated with an initial 1.4 percentage point decline in coverage. Tests for heterogeneous policy effects related to health risk produce mixed results. We find a larger effect of the MLS on individuals who are under age 40 than those who are over that age. However, differences related to self-reported health status and the presence of long-term chronic conditions are not statistically significant.====In addition to having direct implications for health policy in Australia, our analysis is relevant for understanding similar policies that have been enacted elsewhere, such as the ACA's individual mandate. When it went into effect in 2014, the individual mandate penalty for not having private insurance was the same as the MLS penalty: one percent of income. Research on the initial effect of the individual mandate has produced mixed results. In an analysis of all ACA coverage provisions, Frean et al. (2017) conclude that the individual mandate penalties had little impact on insurance coverage. In contrast, three studies focusing only on the individual mandate find a small, but statistically significant positive effect (Jacobs, 2018, Fiedler, 2018, Lurie et al., 2019). Legislation passed in 2017 effectively eliminated the individual mandate penalty, starting in the 2019 tax year. Early anecdotal evidence suggests that the effect of eliminating the penalty has been limited, which is consistent with our finding of an asymmetric effect of the MLS.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the institutional context and the financial incentives for private health insurance in Australia. Section 3 describes the data used in the analyses. Section 4 presents the econometric framework, and discusses the estimation and identification strategy. The results are discussed in Section 5 followed by the policy experiments in Section 6.

As defined by the Institute of Medicine in 1990, clinical practice guidelines are “systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances.” Among other uses, practice guidelines—along with care-recommendation lists and performance measures that derive from such guidelines—offer policymakers and institutions a means of diagnosing the current status of our health care system and a target towards which they may attempt to push provider and patient behavior through various reform initiatives.====A range of studies, however, have demonstrated that medical encounters in the U.S. exhibit a low degree of adherence to established guidelines (McGlynn et al., 2003). There is a widespread belief in health care that one of the possible explanations for this deviation from recommended care is the deficiency in information and medical knowledge among consumers. An enormous number of health policies follow from this assumption, including efforts to educate patients about health, both at a population level through large-scale public health campaigns and at an individual level through provider-led patient education, decision-making support, and so on. Complementing these information-based policies are important demand-side approaches (e.g., high-deductible health plans) intended to improve the efficiency of health care by encouraging direct consumer engagement in the purchase of health care, relying heavily on the notion that informing patients about the costs and benefits of health care services can steer patients towards compliance with guidelines and recommended care.====Recent research has demonstrated the limited utility of demand-side approaches in this regard (Brot-Goldberg et al., 2017). If the information scarcity of patients is to blame for this limited success, it remains possible that further improvements could be made in encouraging compliance with recommended care should policymakers encourage even greater levels of disclosure to patients. In this paper, we attempt to shed light on whether eliminating (or, at least, nearly eliminating) the scarcity of information in medical knowledge – an extreme form of information disclosure – could plausibly lead to the delivery and receipt of care that is more likely to comply with certain recommended guidelines.====A natural way to explore the importance of scarcity of medical knowledge and information is to look at the care received by a group of patients that should have the best possible information on health care practices and clinical conditions: physicians. The decisions of physicians about which type of health care to receive—as patients themselves—would likely place an upper bound on how guideline-compliant non-physicians could become when selecting their health care treatments if fully informed about the costs and benefits of different types of health care interventions.====We do so by using a source of data that has been little used in economics research to date: data on physicians in the Military Health System (MHS). The MHS provides health insurance for all active duty military, their dependents, and retirees. Care is provided both directly on military bases and purchased from an off-base network of contracted providers. The MHS is one of the largest sources of health care spending in the U.S., with spending of over $50 billion per year. We have gathered data on the complete claims records for all MHS enrollees over a ten-year period. Importantly, this includes the claims data for MHS physicians when they are treated as patients themselves (drawing from records of over 35,000 military physicians). The ability to observe physicians as patients provides us with a unique and powerful opportunity to answer the question: do especially well informed patients adhere more closely to the care recommendations made by the established guideline-promulgating community?====For these purposes, we focus on a set of services for which objective, evidence-based guidelines and standards exist and with respect to which the relevant expert community has reached a consensus regarding such standards. We then assess whether physicians as patients receive more services deemed “high value” according to these standards and fewer services deemed “low-value,” in each case relative to the less-informed comparison group of similar non-physician patients. If deficiency of medical knowledge and information is an important reason why demand-side interventions to improve patient adherence with recommend care have met with limited success, we should expect that physicians-as-patients would exhibit markedly higher levels of services deemed high-value by the guidelines and lower levels of services deemed low-value, in each case compared to otherwise similar non-physician patients.====We evaluate two key areas of care that are deemed low-value—and thus over-utilized in practice—by the relevant expert community: (1) diagnostic testing prior to low-risk surgeries (e.g., chest x-ray before eye surgery) and (2) cesarean delivery (deemed low-value on the margin, as opposed to on average). We then evaluate the following forms of care that are deemed high-value—and thus under-utilized—by the relevant expert community: (1) Comprehensive Diabetes Care (e.g., eye-exam, hbA1c testing and attention to nephropathy) for patients with diabetes, (2) statin therapy for patients with diabetes, (3) statin therapy for patients with cardiovascular disease, (4) medication adherence for patients with new diagnoses of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, and (5) childhood vaccinations (e.g., for Chicken Pox, MMR, etc.).====One concern with this analysis, of course, is that physicians may be of different health statuses and have different tastes for medical interventions as a general matter than non-physicians, which may confound an information-based-interpretation of any observed differences in guideline adherence between physician and non-physician patients. We take a range of steps to address this concern. First, by examining both low- and high-value care, we can rule out one-sided bias; e.g., if physicians are unobservably healthy, they will get less low-value care but also less high-value care. Second, we control for a rich set of health indicators, including prior year medical spending, that correlate with any underlying health differences across groups. Third, we compare physicians to other military officers, to control for underlying tastes. Fourth, we compare dependents of physicians with dependents of military officers, two groups that are likely even more similar along unobservables, but one of which—dependents of physicians—potentially benefits from the informational advantages of their physician family member.====Our results suggest that physicians do only slightly better than non-physicians in adhering to the recommendations that we identify – but not by much and not always. Across most of our low-value settings, physician-patients do adhere more closely to low-value-care recommendations than do non-physician patients, but the differences are modest, and generally amount to less than one-fifth of the gap between what is received by non-physicians and recommended guidelines. The results are slightly more mixed in the case of the high-value care analysis, with some evidence suggesting that physician-patients adhere to the high-value-care recommendations at roughly the same rate as do non-physicians and some evidence suggesting that physician-patients adhere at slightly higher rates than non-physicians.====In addition to illuminating the impacts of information by comparing physician and non-physician patients, we also compare the levels of adherence reached by physician patients with recommended levels of adherence, finding substantial gaps in these latter comparisons. Altogether, we note that both groups—physicians and non-physicians—fail to adhere to the studied guidelines a substantial portion of the time—e.g., upwards of 35% of the sponsors in the low-risk surgery sample receive some form of pre-operative diagnostic care.====If one assumes that physician-patients agree with the merits of the guidelines that we investigate, then our results suggest that the information deficiencies of patients may not explain much of the deviations that we observe from recommended practices. Accordingly, one might expect only limited impacts from reforms providing additional disclosures (beyond prevailing levels) to patients.====We acknowledge that one possible explanation behind our observation that physician-patients deviate from the studied guidelines may be that they have yet to embrace the merits of the guidelines. This may be due to a situation in which the physician-patients either affirmatively disagree with the guidelines or simply do not practice in the relevant clinical area and have not received the day-to-day dosage of information that may push them to adopt the guidelines. We do set forth limited evidence to support this latter failure-to-adopt possibility in the case of our investigation into diagnostic testing prior to low-risk surgeries, whereby we find slightly larger treatment effects for those physician-patients who also perform low-risk procedures as providers. Even this group of informed providers with relevant practice-area experience, however, fails to adhere to the indicated guidelines much of the time, suggesting that this explanation cannot fully account for the observed deviations from recommended care by physician patients.====Taking this analysis one step further, we do not find evidence of a correspondence in the rate by which physician-patients adhere to the pre-operative testing guidelines when they are patients and the rate by which their own patients adhere when these physicians perform these procedures as providers. This latter observation cuts against an interpretation of our findings as arising from affirmative disagreements with the guidelines. Altogether, our findings suggest that factors other than information and clinical beliefs contributes to the bulk of the deviations from recommended practices that we observe.====In any event, even if some amount of the observed guideline-deviations derives from the failure of the physician-patients in our sample to have updated their priors in accordance with the guidelines, the policy implications arguably remain the same. That is, if one assumes that physician-patients have been exposed to the recommendations but simply lack the day-to-day experiences that may lead them to adopt the guidelines, our results still speak to an upper bound of the impacts on guideline-adherence that might arise from ==== information-disclosure initiatives aimed at lay patients.====Our paper proceeds as follows. Part 2 reviews the existing literature on the impacts of health care information initiatives and on informed providers. Part 3 provides a background on the MHS and discusses our data and empirical methodology. Part 4 presents the results of our analysis and Part 5 fleshes out the implications of those findings.

This paper examines whether the design of parental ,"Low-income children are significantly less likely to receive recommended health care services compared to their higher income counterparts (Berdahl et al., 2013). This observation holds true even among children who are insured (Case and Paxson, 2002). In fact, nearly all children with family income below the federal poverty level are eligible for public health insurance in the United States, yet stark disparities in the receipt of health care and health outcomes persist. For example, Medicaid-eligible children are more likely to have tooth decay but less likely to visit the dentist compared to children from higher income families despite the fact that all state Medicaid programs cover dental services for children (Berdahl et al., 2016; Edelstein and Chinn, 2009). These disparities may have effects that extend beyond health. For example, research has shown that poor oral health may affect a child’s school attendance and academic performance (Agaku et al., 2015; Jackson et al., 2011).====This paper poses the question of whether the design of parental Medicaid benefit packages could serve as a new mechanism for reducing unmet health care needs among low-income, insured children. I use state-level variation in Medicaid adult dental coverage to examine whether there is a plausibly causal link between parental and child health behaviors among low-income families. While most states cover emergency dental services for adult enrollees, only about half have provided coverage of preventive and/or restorative dental services in the recent past (Decker and Lipton, 2015). Further, states have added and dropped these benefits over time. Prior research has shown that providing coverage of preventive dental care significantly increases the likelihood that an adult visits the dentist (Abdus and Decker, 2019; Decker and Lipton, 2015; Choi, 2011).====Medicaid adult dental coverage could affect child dental care use in several ways. First, health care related decisions are complex and may not adhere to standard economic assumptions such as perfect information (Baicker et al., 2012). Gaining dental insurance through Medicaid may help a parent to better understand the costs and benefits of taking a child to the dentist by bringing awareness or salience to dental benefits available to publicly insured children or through resulting provider contact. Second, certain costs such as finding a provider and learning about the benefits of having a dental visit could be applied to both parent and child.==== Past research finds that participation in Medicaid increases with family size, providing support for the notion that fixed costs play a role in a related decision-making process (Currie, 2000). Finally, dental coverage may reduce out-of-pocket spending or improve a parent’s employment prospects (Singhal et al., 2013), increasing financial resources that could be used for a child’s health care.====This paper uses a difference-in-differences regression design and 2000–2013 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data to assess the effects of Medicaid adult dental coverage on both parents and children. The main samples consist of parents with at least one minor co-residing child who report Medicaid enrollment and children with at least one parent enrolled in Medicaid as these groups are expected to be directly affected by changes to Medicaid benefit coverage policies. Estimates for these samples may be biased if dental benefits increase enrollment in Medicaid among eligible adults, inducing systematic correlation between dental benefits and sample composition. To account for this possibility, I also provide estimates for samples more likely to be treated but not defined based on parental Medicaid enrollment, including parents and children in low-income families, and alternatively, low-educated families. The results of these analyses are generally qualitatively consistent with the findings from the main analysis and confirm that results are concentrated among groups more likely to be treated.====I find that adult dental coverage is associated with a 5.1 percentage point increase in the likelihood of a recent dental visit among children with at least one parent on Medicaid. Since dental coverage is associated with a 13.8 percentage point increase in the likelihood that a parent had a recent visit, a rough calculation suggests that between 20 and 37% of parent visits result in a child visit.==== Effects appear to be concentrated among children under age 12, with little evidence of an effect among children ages 12 and over. I estimate effects in the expected direction for other outcomes plausibly related to increased child access to dental care, including emergency department visits and missed school days, however none of these estimates are statistically significant at conventional levels.====An exploratory analysis of potential mechanisms suggests that changes in the perception of cost-related barriers to child dental care use are unlikely to provide a complete explanation for the results. I also find little evidence that improvements in family financial resources play a major role. While there is some evidence that effects vary with family size, I do not find strong evidence in favor of a fixed costs mechanism. Effects among children are concentrated among those residing with a mother who had a recent dental visit, suggesting that an information channel may be a more likely explanation.====Event study estimates do not suggest violations of the parallel trends assumption. The results are also robust to a number of sensitivity tests, including controlling for state-year variables plausibly related to Medicaid benefit generosity, inclusion of state-specific trends, trimming early- and late-adopting states, and using triple difference models to estimate effects for treated children and adults relative to a within-state control group.====This work is related to the literature examining the household-level impacts of public health insurance policies. For example, a growing body of work suggests that public health insurance eligibility expansions targeting one or more family members have implications for household finances (Levy et al., 2019; Hu et al., 2018; Miller et al., 2018; Dillender, 2017; Mazumder and Miller, 2016; Wherry et al. 2016; Saloner, 2013; Leininger et al., 2010) and the healthcare related decisions of other family members (Sacarny et al., 2020; Hamersma et al., 2018; Hudson and Moriya, 2017; Sommers et al., 2016; Devoe et al., 2015; Koch, 2015; Monheit and Vistnes, 2015; Devoe et al., 2008; Sommers, 2006; Aizer and Grogger, 2003; Dubay and Kenney, 2003; Cutler and Gruber, 1996). The latter strand of literature is most closely related to the present work. This research suggests that extending Medicaid eligibility to parents is associated with an increased likelihood of public coverage among already eligible children (Sacarny et al., 2020; Hamersma et al., 2018; Hudson and Moriya, 2017; Sommers et al., 2016; Devoe et al., 2015; Sommers, 2006; Aizer and Grogger, 2003). A few studies address the related question of the spillover effects of public health insurance expansions to children on adults and also find evidence of effects (Koch, 2015; Monheit and Vistnes, 2015; Cutler and Gruber, 1996).====Fewer studies with rigorous identification strategies have examined the association between parental and child ====, such has having a provider visit. One recent article examining past adult Medicaid eligibility expansions found substantial spillover effects to receipt of well-child visits among low-income children (Venkataramani et al., 2017). Other related studies (Devoe et al., 2009; Davidoff et al., 2003), including research on dental care (Finlayson et al., 2014; Isong et al., 2010), have produced findings in line with this work. However, the correlational design of these studies makes disentangling common, pre-existing familial factors from any potential causal relationship challenging.====This paper complements and builds on existing literature by providing evidence of a plausibly causal connection between parental and child health behaviors for a specific health service. In comparison with the majority of studies that use public health insurance eligibility expansions to examine related research questions, the present research has the advantage that all states provided comprehensive dental benefits to publicly insured children during the study period.==== Further, changes in eligibility affect access to a bundle of health care services, whereas changes to dental benefits only affect access to a single service. Therefore, this analysis may be better able to isolate the effects of changing a parent’s coverage status.====By establishing a direct connection between parental and child health behaviors, these results could inform policies that affect low-income children and their families. Because some benefits, such as dental coverage, are mandatory for children enrolled in public health insurance but optional for parents, this research could also help to build the case for states to provide these benefits to parents with one objective being to increase the use of related services among children.",Adult Medicaid benefit generosity and receipt of recommended health services among low-income children: The spillover effects of Medicaid adult dental coverage expansions,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016762962031050X,23 November 2020,2020,Research Article,194.0

To isolate exogenous changes in health, the ==== model uses quasi-experimental variation in cardiovascular disease mortality across states over time. Based on data for the white population, the results show that there is a causal link between health and income per person, and they provide novel evidence that health dynamics shape life-cycle incomes. Life-cycle income profiles slope more strongly at the beginning and at the end of work life in 2000 than in 1960, indicating that age becomes a more prominent determinant of income dynamics over this period. The channels for this transformation include better health, higher educational attainment, and changing labor supply.","Improving the health of the population is an important objective of social policy. While economists agree that rising aggregate income improves health, they still debate over whether improving health reversely spurs aggregate income. Such a causal link is conceivable if health affects incomes by raising worker productivity, educational attainment, or labor supply (for example, Ben-Porath, 1967). While some studies provide evidence of a causal link between health and income (Weil, 2007, Aghion et al., 2011, Cervellati and Sunde, 2011, Bloom et al., 2014), other studies contest this link (Acemoglu and Johnson, 2007, Acemoglu and Johnson, 2014, Hansen, 2014, Hansen and Lønstrup, 2015). This debate focuses on the health effects for the entire population and, thereby, neglects age. Given that the workforce ages and as the susceptibility to diseases changes with age, this focus overlooks how health improvements shape incomes over the life cycle, how measurement of health at various ages affects outcomes, and which economic factors impact incomes at different ages.====In this paper I investigate the long-run effects of health dynamics—that is, major improvements in health over time—on income growth in the United States. In particular, I examine the causal link between health and income for the workforce aged 15–64, and I will then test for heterogeneity in the effects of health dynamics on incomes over the life cycle. I exploit large improvements in health, proxied by life expectancy, which have arrived through medical advance in treating cardiovascular diseases and public health campaigns starting in the 1960s. The subsequent sharp decline in cardiovascular disease mortality accounted for 70% of the increase in life expectancy between 1960 and 2000 (Cutler et al., 2006, p. 104). Thanks to its salient impact on public health, epidemiologists refer to this decline as the cardiovascular revolution (Foege, 1987).====The cardiovascular revolution constitutes a unique source of exogenous variation in health across states over time. How strongly medical advance in treating cardiovascular diseases impacted a state's life expectancy depended on the initial prevalence of these diseases within the state. The empirical model combines the differences in cardiovascular disease mortality before the cardiovascular revolution with the unexpected medical advance in treating these diseases after 1960 to predict the mortality decline for each state. The model then uses these predictions as instruments for changes in life expectancy. Conceptually, this approach follows the empirical strategy by Acemoglu and Johnson (2007) and Bleakley (2007).====Based on data for the white population, the results show that health improvements boost aggregate incomes: an increase in life expectancy by 1% raises income per person by 1.7%. In total, the health dynamics of the cardiovascular revolution account for an increase in income of 13% compared to 1960, and thus explain one-quarter of the income growth between 1960 and 2000. The health effects differ qualitatively and quantitatively across age cohorts. Life expectancy positively affects income per person at prime working ages between 25 and 54, whereas it exerts no or even a negative effect on income per person under age 24 and over age 55. It is important for the estimation results at which age life expectancy is measured because the cardiovascular revolution predominantly improved adult health. In particular, the results overstate the health effects on income for proxies that understate the age-specific changes in life expectancy, and they understate the health effects on income for proxies that overstate the age-specific changes in life expectancy. The cardiovascular revolution directly shaped life-cycle incomes by improving individual health, and it indirectly shaped them by raising educational attainment and by changing labor supply.====This paper contributes to the literature in several ways. It most closely relates to work by Hansen and Strulik (2017), who are the first to use variation from the cardiovascular revolution to show a causal link between health and college enrollment in the United States. In contrast to their work, I analyze how health dynamics shape life-cycle incomes and which factors explain this process. My results indicate that educational attainment is one channel through which health dynamics raise incomes, and thus complement their results.====The results in this paper show that health improvements spur income per person in the long run and thus provide a further piece of evidence for a causal link running from health to aggregate income. My evidence of positive effects of adult health on incomes, education, and labor supply complements evidence by Bleakley (2007) and Bhalotra and Venkataramani (2015) for positive effects of childhood health on education, income, and labor supply following medical advances and health interventions in the United States during the first half of the twentieth century—and, more generally, evidence from the microeconomic literature that stresses the importance of childhood health for economic outcomes at adult age (see Currie, 2009, Almond et al., 2018, for a review). In addition, my results concur with the empirical finding of Lorentzen et al. (2008) that high mortality impairs economic development.====Moreover, this paper demonstrates that the age at which health conditions are measured matters for the estimation results. Many studies use a summary measure of health (for example, life expectancy at birth) to investigate its effects on income. However, if this measure overstates the changes in health of the workforce, then the results understate the health effects on income. Consider, for example, the third stage of the epidemiological transition, which is characterized by a sharp decline of infectious disease mortality. During this transition, life expectancy at birth primarily increases due to reductions in infant and child mortality (WHO, 2008). Therefore, using the change in life expectancy at birth to measure improvements in adult health produces estimates that understate the effects on income. Hence, this finding suggests that the health effect on income growth is more pronounced than indicated by previous work (for example, Acemoglu and Johnson, 2007, Acemoglu and Johnson, 2014, Cervellati and Sunde, 2011, Bloom et al., 2014, Hansen, 2014).====Furthermore, this paper provides novel evidence of transformations of life-cycle incomes for the workforce over time. Life-cycle income profiles slope more strongly at the beginning and at the end of work life in 2000 than in 1960, indicating that age becomes a more prominent determinant of income dynamics over this period. However, the average age of peak productivity (in terms of income) does not shift. This evidence extends previous research that shows shifts of peak productivity toward higher ages if measured by scientific breakthroughs of researchers (Jones and Weinberg, 2011), and toward younger ages if measured by skills in information and communication technologies (Falck et al., 2016). The stability of peak productivity suggests that health improvements do not prevent potential adverse effects on economic performance that arise from an increasing share of workers over the age of peak productivity in the workforce. Hence, this paper also sheds new light on results of research on the effects of demographic change for economic development (Feyrer, 2007, Sánchez-Romero, 2013, Kotschy and Sunde, 2018).====Finally, this paper shows that health improvements shape life-cycle incomes by raising educational attainment and by changing labor supply over the life cycle without substantially altering lifetime working hours. Therefore, increasing longevity does not require higher lifetime labor supply to boost educational attainment. These findings confirm theoretical predictions and simulation results of Cervellati and Sunde (2013), Sánchez-Romero et al. (2016), and Strulik and Werner (2016), which are based upon Ben-Porath models that incorporate health. These results are also consistent with work by D’Albis et al. (2012), which demonstrates that health improvements during working ages lead to earlier retirement if mortality reductions raise expected lifetime wealth sufficiently.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the background of the health improvements that were made during the cardiovascular revolution. Section 3 introduces the empirical framework and the data. Section 4 presents the estimation results.

Across countries and over the past decades, the typical hospital birth has changed: We have witnessed an increase in the use of medical procedures, such as Caesarean sections (CS) and inductions, not only for at-risk populations but also for a more general and healthy population of births. While an existing literature has documented large benefits of additional medical care and specialized medical technologies for at-risk births in the short- and longer-run (Almond et al., 2010, Almond and Doyle, 2011, Bharadwaj et al., 2013, Daysal et al., 2015, Jensen and Wüst, 2015), we lack causal evidence on the impact of the level and variability of medical care that is informative for the majority of ex ante uncomplicated births. This paper starts filling this gap by studying the impact of one factor that may impact both the allocation of care and patient health, namely naturally occurring variation in the number of admissions to maternity wards or temporary maternity ward crowding. Thus we ask: What is the causal impact of being admitted for birth on a busy day rather than a less busy day on both procedure use and on child and maternal health?====Crowding breaks the link between underlying patient characteristics and assigned health care treatment because of the nature of maternity ward admissions: While wards can anticipate some of the variation in admissions (Macfarlane, 1978, Allin et al., 2015, Johnson and Rehavi, 2016), they cannot perfectly predict it. Maternity wards operate in a similar fashion as emergency rooms, with admissions that are hard to schedule for (expected) uncomplicated birth. Thus our empirical strategy exploits variation in daily maternity ward admissions conditional on ward, year, season, day of week and ward times year fixed effects. Controlling for these factors allows us to study the impact of the residual variation in crowding beyond the expected admission load on a given day of admission for otherwise similar patients with a spontaneous birth.====To examine the impact of crowding on procedure use and health, we exploit data on all admissions to Danish maternity wards in the years 2000–2014. In our data, we observe large day-to-day variation in admissions of well above 100 percent of mean admissions, and deviations of above 200 percent are not rare. Furthermore, the within-ward (over time) variation in crowding is similar to the level of variation we observe across maternity wards, i.e. in the number of daily admissions across small and large wards.====We first show that maternity wards change their care provision due to unexpected fluctuations in the number of daily admissions. This analysis is informative both in its own right but also for understanding potential consequences for patient health: Capacity or lack hereof may be among non-medical factors that impact procedure use. We find that maternity wards use fewer procedures for births admitted on crowded days relative to less crowded days.==== Specifically, we find small but significant decreases in the probability of experiencing a medically induced birth. These findings may indicate that maternity ward staff attempt to alleviate pressure by avoiding to speed up deliveries (and postpone inductions). This finding is interesting in the light of the steadily increasing induction rates in many developed health care systems and accompanying debates on the benefits of the procedure in marginal cases. Moreover, in supplementary analyses on a subset of our data, we find that maternity wards adjust the timing of admission on a given day during busy periods: Mothers admitted on crowded days give birth faster, i.e. they are likely admitted at later stages of their birth. Likely related to the (on average) shorter stays at the maternity ward for women in labor, we find that those admitted on crowded days are less likely to receive pain relief, measured as the probability of having an epidural. Finally, while we see different types of adjustments in the wards with respect to procedures used and their timing, we do not detect effects on waiting times for pain relief in the form of epidurals (for those receiving an epidural), the timely initiation of skin-to-skin contact between the mother and the infant, and mothers’ probability of having an emergency CS (our closest measures of patient experience).====Next, we examine the health consequences of temporary crowding on the day of the mother's admission for birth outcomes and child health in the first two years of life. We show that while crowding induces changes to the provision of care, it has only small effects on child and mother health in our sample. These health outcomes include infant well-being as measured by the probability of having a low APGAR score (a measure for infant Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, and Respiration) at 5 min; the probability of experiencing birth and post-birth complications for mothers; children's mortality, post-birth hospital stay, neonatal care admission, and readmissions and contacts to general practitioners (GPs) during the first two years of their life. Among these measures we specifically consider outcomes that relate to staff intensity (severe lacerations during birth) and severity (post-birth maternal complications that require additional medical procedures or operations). For maternal complications at and shortly after birth we find small but significant decreases due to more crowding–a result that likely relates to the decreased use of procedures such as inductions and pain relief on crowded days.====Our results for both health outcomes and procedure use are similar across alternative measures of temporary crowding such as an absolute measure based on the number of daily admissions and relative measures defined within a given ward. Furthermore, we do not find evidence of threshold effects, i.e. we do not find that our main results based on a continuous crowding measure and a linear regression model mask heterogeneity by the level of crowding (in the range observed in our data). Finally, we find limited evidence for heterogeneity in the effects across characteristics of the birth or hospital. Our findings suggest that the effect of crowding on the probability of experiencing an induction is strongest for first-born children, children born at a gestational age above 41 weeks, and children admitted to the largest maternity wards. Given that pregnancies at term or after are the main target group for inductions, our finding of stronger effects of crowding on inductions for beyond-term births and the absence of detectable health effects may indicate that maternity wards provide too many inductions on less busy days.====Our work contributes to an established literature on the impact of crowding for health care provision and health outcomes.==== In this literature, studies vary in (i) the health care settings studied (and, as a result, the patient pool and health care organization considered), (ii) their measure of crowding (number of admissions, staff-patient ratios) and (iii) their approach towards handling unobserved factors that may impact both, crowding and patient health.====A number of studies has shown negative associations between crowding and patient health outcomes across settings (see, for example, Aiken et al., 2002, Morley et al., 2018).==== Building on these correlational findings that predominantly use across-hospital variation, the literature on the impact of crowding has moved towards causally-identified estimates. These causal studies fall in two broad strands that either exploit legislative changes that permanently alter staffing levels (Cook et al., 2012, Matsudaira, 2014), or use sudden (within) hospital shocks that temporarily change the staff-patient ratio to identify the impact of crowding (Evans and Kim, 2006, Facchini, 2017, Woodworth, 2020). Our work is closely related to the second strand of studies, which–across different health care settings–has typically found smaller (if any) impact of changes in the patient-staff ratio or crowding shocks on health outcomes: Exploiting unexpected surges in hospital admissions that result in changes in the staff-patient ratio, Evans and Kim (2006) find only limited evidence for impacts of large shocks to hospital admissions on the length of the hospital stay and the risk of a subsequent readmission. Focusing on emergency room care, on the other hand, Woodworth (2020) uses sudden crowding shocks in established emergency departments due to the opening of new emergency departments to show that an alleviation of emergency department patient volume does matter for patient health: lower volumes lead to significantly lower patient mortality.==== We complement this existing work on temporary crowding by providing evidence from the maternity ward – an until now under-studied setting. Moreover, our estimates for the health effects of crowding focus on an (on average) more healthy patient group than considered in much of the existing work: mothers, who give birth spontaneously. Finally, we study the policy-relevant margin of day-to-day variation in crowding. This analysis distinguishes our paper from studies that consider the impact of larger crowding shocks (such as closures or openings of new wards).====Besides providing estimates for the health impacts of crowding, we contribute novel evidence on crowding and the allocation of care and procedures in the maternity ward. Evidence on the ways in which crowding influences treatment decisions is scarce but instrumental for our understanding of drivers of medical care allocation. Existing research shows that crowding impacts decisions on the allocation of care: Harris et al. (2019) show that higher work-load in primary care settings leads to fewer procedures, fewer diagnoses, and more referrals. Within the area of neonatal care, Freedman (2016) exploits variation in empty beds at hospital neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) to document that short-term excess capacity increases NICU utilization among relatively low-risk infants but does not impact usage among at-risk infants. This finding suggests that the greater availability of resources affects the provision of care, especially for infants where the treatment decision is highly dependent on the discretion of medical professionals. Facchini (2017) uses data from one Italian maternity ward to document that crowding affects decisions about care allocation and procedure use. Specifically, women admitted for birth at times with a low midwife/patient ratio are more likely to receive an unscheduled CS than women admitted at times with better coverage. He also studies health outcomes and–in line with other causal studies on crowding–finds no significant effects on measures such as skin-to-skin contact, breastfeeding, APGAR<9, or NICU admissions but large standard errors preclude a conclusion of no important health effects.====While we do not observe the patient-staff ratio (as in Facchini (2017)), our paper contributes new evidence on the causal impact of crowding on a broader set of medical treatments assigned to births (other than CS), and we are not constrained to one maternity ward and resulting power issues. Thus we extend on a closely related study by Marks and Choi (2019), who study the impact of temporary crowding at the maternity ward on the health of at-risk infants and health care spending in the U.S. They find that at-risk infants born on “slow days” receive more costly care (measured as overall hospital spending)—but they find limited mortality benefits of this additional spending. By studying procedure use and health outcomes in maternity wards in Denmark, we highlight the importance of accumulating empirical evidence on central policy questions across different settings: First, we open the black box of health care spending by providing evidence on the impact of crowding on specific procedures and treatments. Second, while Marks and Choi (2019) focus on the impact of crowding on the 10 percent at-risk infants in their data, we study the majority of non at-risk infants. We document changes in care and procedures provided for this group, while Marks and Choi (2019) do not find that crowding predicts spending for low-risk births in the U.S. This finding implies that also care for low-risk infants is susceptible to the impact of crowding.==== Third, by considering a different margin of the patient health distribution, we confirm that, although crowding impacts procedure use also in this patient group, health effects are limited.====In sum, our paper contributes causally-identified evidence on crowding and its limited impact on patient health for a general and (on average) healthy population of patients in a so far understudied setting: the maternity ward. Moreover, we show that crowding impacts procedure use and thus we contribute new evidence on drivers of medical care allocation. Important for health care policy, our findings on the impact of crowding in Danish maternity wards suggest that wards react to temporary crowding by adjusting medical care assignment across several margins, among them the exact timing of admission during the day and the use of medical procedures. While our findings are not informative about the optimal absolute level of care in the maternity ward, we conclude that maternity wards in the Danish setting can balance natural variation in admissions for a general population of spontaneous births without negative health effects in the outcomes that we can study.====The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 provides information on the institutional background and our data. Section 3 presents our empirical strategy and discusses the identifying assumptions. Section 4 presents our main results and examines their robustness.

Recently, Mexico's largest healthcare provider began issuing automatic-refill prescriptions to stable hypertensive ==== on adherence, as clinic congestion falls.","Decisions related to the management of chronic illnesses have the potential to significantly enhance efficiency. Finding the efficient level of monitoring in terms of the frequency with which patients see a physician may be a good strategy to improve the allocation of scarce medical resources and reduce costs without harming patients’ health. Chronic conditions require constant health monitoring, which is costly in terms of resources such as clinic space and physician time, and may also be time-consuming and inconvenient for patients. When too frequent, these costs may outweigh the health benefits of meeting with a healthcare provider and gains in terms of efficiency may be achieved by reducing health monitoring. However, there is relatively little research into the effects of reducing the frequency of doctor visits, where the benefits might be small if they happen too often (Chandra and Skinner, 2012). Furthermore, if chronic patients value the convenience of receiving healthcare less often, allowing patients with good self-management of their disease to switch to a low-frequency regime may be a useful and efficient policy tool to promote healthy behaviors.====This paper analyzes the intended and unintended effects of a change in the frequency with which chronic patients must meet their physician. Implemented in 2013 by Mexico's largest public healthcare provider, in a context where patients were required to visit physicians relatively frequently to obtain their medications, the ==== program reduced the frequency of monitoring for stable hypertensive (high blood pressure) patients in an attempt to eliminate arguably unnecessary appointments for patients whose condition was under control.==== This was done by allowing physicians to issue multiple “automatic-refill” prescriptions, thus reducing the frequency of doctors’ appointments from one every month (30 days) to one every three months (90 days). It is important to note that doctors affected by this policy are salaried workers who earn a monthly wage that was unaffected by the policy or by seeing patients less frequently.====I examine the effects of this policy on a specific patient behavior that is key in the management of chronic conditions: medication adherence. Medication adherence is defined as patients’ conformance with their provider's recommendations for medication-taking, and has been found to be a key input for the production of health, in particular for patients with chronic conditions that require life-long therapeutic treatment (Ho et al., 2009). A lower frequency of health monitoring could have a positive effect on adherence if it reduces the transaction costs of accessing treatment (Batal et al., 2007). However, it could also have a negative effect by decreasing the number of interactions with a health provider or by decreasing the perceived importance of self-management of the disease, for instance; continuity of care provides opportunities to improve patients’ self-management of their condition (Guthmann et al., 2005). Additionally, the direction of the effects of visit frequency on medication adherence is likely to depend on baseline frequency. Additionally, if only adherent patients are allowed to remain on a low-frequency regime and patients value the convenience of going less frequently to see their doctor, the low-frequency regime could be used as a “reward” and incentivize people to improve their behavior, thus further increasing adherence.====I use novel high-quality administrative longitudinal data from the IMSS (====), Mexico's largest healthcare provider, which allows me to follow over four million hypertensive patients over time, and observe their prescription-filling histories. The structure of the data allows me to use a difference-in-differences approach at the individual level by including patient fixed effects. I include a myriad of robustness tests and find consistent results across specifications, including using alternative measures of adherence and different subsets of patients. Additionally, to alleviate concerns that patients do not endogenously select into or out of the low-frequency regime I exploit clinic-level variation in the intensity with which the program was adopted to identify causal effects to which estimations are also robust. For this strategy, which is the preferred specification, I find consistent results when I either use aggregate adherence measures at the clinic level as outcomes or regress individual measures of adherence on clinic-level exposure to the policy in a reduced-form setting.====The program's unique policy design allows me to explore whether patients change adherence when health monitoring is reduced (which lowers the cost of filling prescriptions as transaction costs are lower for automatic-refill prescriptions, but also decreases interactions with healthcare providers). Additionally, I may test whether patients value being on a low-frequency regime. I am able to observe patients on high- and low-frequency regimes (as some patients change from one regime to another) and, for those on the low-frequency regime, observe both regular and automatic-refill prescription fillings (the former happen at doctor's appointments, while the latter occur directly at a pharmacy). Finally, I am able to analyze the effect of the program on clinic congestion and whether it had spillovers for patients who remained on the high-frequency regime.====I present three major findings. First, I find that patients who went on the ===='s low-frequency program significantly improved their medication adherence. Receiving a prescription that covers treatment for 90 days (as opposed to 30) reduces the number of days a patient is out of medication between fillings—the treatment gap—by 2.2 days, a reduction of 35% with respect to the mean treatment gap of 6.37 days for persistent patients ==== (i.e., before August 2013), representing an improvement in adherence of 6.4%.==== Patients treated at the most congested clinics show a larger effect of the policy on their prescription-filling behavior (arguably, as they experienced a larger reduction in the transaction costs of filling prescriptions). The magnitude of the effects found compares favorably to other interventions aimed directly at improving medication adherence, especially when considering that the policy had no monetary costs and actually helped free up medical resources. A meta-analysis of interventions to improve medication adherence in the US found increases in adherence of between 4 and 11% (Peterson et al., 2003).====Second, I present evidence consistent with hypertensive patients valuing the convenience of going ==== often to doctors’ appointments. In particular, the evidence suggests that patients improve adherence in order to be allowed to remain on the low-frequency regime. This is supported by the fact that changes in behavior are not only driven by the reduction in transaction costs from filling automatic-refill prescriptions. This finding suggests that patients also perceive the low-frequency regime as a “reward” which may be used to incentivize medication adherence. The fact that individuals may modify their behavior in order to avoid time-consuming appointments can be used as a more general, interesting, and efficient policy instrument that could be applied in other (healthcare ==== non-healthcare) settings as well. For example, Black et al. (2003) find that the “threat” of receiving reemployment training services is more effective than receiving the services themselves. Knack (1993) finds individuals are more likely to register to vote if this will not increase their probability of having to serve on a jury.====Third, I find efficiency gains from the program, as clinic congestion was reduced without apparent detrimental effects on patients’ health. I find evidence of positive spillovers on medication adherence for patients who remained in the high-frequency regime (arguably from a fall in the transaction costs of healthcare monitoring as a result of reduced congestion). Additionally, patients’ health appears to remain stable despite meeting less often with their healthcare provider.====These three findings are consistent with the idea that reducing the frequency of medical appointments for hypertensive patients is efficient, at least on the margin of monthly ==== quarterly visits, and that reduced health monitoring ==== improve medication adherence, particularly in contexts with relatively frequent health monitoring. When baseline frequency is high, longer intervals between visits reduce the cost of managing hypertension for both healthcare providers and patients and show no strong evidence of a detrimental effect on health. While these findings may not apply in contexts with low-enough frequency—at some point, increasing the time between doctor's appointments will harm patients’ health—my results present evidence that important gains can be achieved from reducing relatively frequent check-ups and that it is important to find optimal health monitoring for chronic conditions.====The results show that simplifying the management of chronic conditions (by reducing the number of required appointments in this case) may be an important element in improving medication adherence. The fact that eliminating monthly physician visits improves self-management of disease is consistent with the broader health economics literature, which finds that general inconveniences and time costs may be important barriers to the take-up of health products and healthcare (Dupas and Miguel, 2017, Acton, 1975). In particular, reducing nonmonetary costs of healthcare has been found to increase the demand for services offered at health facilities such as vaccinations (Banerjee et al., 2010), contraceptives (Ashraf et al., 2014), fetching HIV test results (Thornton, 2008), and male medical circumcisions (Chinkhumba et al., 2014). These results also give some supporting evidence that lower-frequency regimes may be used to reward patients with better self-management of chronic conditions.====While the lessons learned from the IMSS program—in terms of finding the efficient frequency of health monitoring and improving self-management of disease—may apply to other individual behaviors, medication adherence is of interest in its own right. The WHO recognizes poor adherence as a critical issue in population health from the perspectives of both quality of life and health economics worldwide (WHO, 2003). This paper contributes to the literature on the determinants of non-adherence.====Medication adherence has been found to be most improved by interventions that can be classified into three broad categories: monetary interventions (i.e., changes in co-payment (Atella et al., 2006); financial incentives (Volpp et al., 2008)); information interventions (i.e., health education (Morisky et al., 1983, Lee et al., 2006); patients’ knowledge of medication (Gwadry-Sridhar et al., 2013)); and patient reminders (Smith et al., 2008, Piette et al., 2000). While these types of interventions have been found to be successful at improving medication adherence, they may be costly and often have only temporary effects that disappear once the intervention ends. Promoting medication adherence by reducing health monitoring or by offering less frequent monitoring as a reward for adequate self-management may be an attractive alternative to promote adherence in resource-constrained settings where monitoring is relatively frequent, as it is costless (it in fact liberates health resources) and may also be implemented in the long term. It is also worth noting that all of the above-mentioned studies were conducted in developed countries and, with the exception of Atella et al. (2006) which looks at the case of Italy and Gwadry-Sridhar et al. (2013)—a systematic review of the literature—all studies focus on the United States. My results thus contribute to understanding the determinants of adherence in the context of a less developed country.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents some background information on IMSS and the ==== program. Section 3 describes the data and shows some preliminary evidence. Section 4 discusses the empirical strategy and presents the paper's main results, as well as some robustness checks. Section 5 discusses the interpretation and implications of the results.

This decrease in life expectancy reflects a dramatic increase in deaths from so-called “deaths of despair” – alcohol, drugs and suicide – among Americans without a college degree (Case and Deaton, 2015, Case and Deaton, 2017). In this paper, we examine how the two main economic policies that increase after-tax incomes of low-income Americans – the minimum wage and the earned income tax credit (EITC) – causally affect deaths from drug overdoses, alcohol, and suicide.====To do so, we use geocoded underlying cause of death data from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and leverage plausibly exogenous variation across states and time in these two policies. We employ event study models estimating changes in mortality around the time that states increase the minimum wage or implement state EITCs. Moreover, we implement the standard approach in the minimum wage and EITC literatures to estimate panel models of cause-specific mortality over time, controlling for state and year fixed effects, testing for parallel pre-trends and implementing a series of falsification and robustness tests. These tests include a set of placebo regressions, checking for effects in a sample of adults with a bachelor’s degree or higher and effects on cancer outcomes. Since college graduates are unlikely to work minimum wage jobs or to be eligible for the EITC, any effects on this group are likely spurious, indicating a problem with the research design. Similarly, cancer outcomes are not likely to be affected by short-term changes such as minimum wage increases.====Our models do not find a significant effect of either policy on drug or alcohol mortality. However, both higher minimum wages and EITCs significantly reduce non-drug suicides among less-educated adults. Our estimated event study models establish parallel pre-trends: states that increase their minimum wages or expand their EITCs do not experience differential trends in suicide rates in the years leading up to the implementation of the new higher standard. Moreover, the event study models show a discontinuous drop in suicide mortality at the time of minimum wage increases and implementation of state EITCs. We do not find significant mortality reductions for the college-educated placebo sample or for cancer outcomes, which is reassuring for our study design. We also find indications of heterogeneous effects by gender, in particular for the minimum wage. Estimated effects are larger and more statistically significant for women; for men, the event study models do not detect a statistically significant drop in suicides, and the generalized difference-in-differences estimate is smaller.====While the mortality data covers the near-universe of deaths, it does not include information on employment status or income. In order to better understand the validity and impacts of our estimates, we supplement our analysis with auxiliary data from the Current Population Survey and find that estimated effects significantly correlate with exposure to policies based on age and gender: subsamples with larger exposure to minimum wages tend to have larger associated effects of minimum wages on suicides, while estimated effects of the EITC on average are larger for groups that have higher rates of estimated EITC receipt. However, when examining effects by race, we find little evidence that effects of these policies are larger among non-White subgroups, a surprising finding given the relatively higher exposure to these policies among racial and ethnic minorities.====Our findings for suicide are consistent with other recent research identifying economic correlates of suicide—non-employment, lack of health insurance, home foreclosures and debt crises (Reeves et al., 2012; Chang et al., 2013). For example, higher incomes generated by minimum wage increases have been shown to substantially improve credit ratings, reducing the cost of credit and easing the debt problems (Cooper et al., 2020) that can precipitate suicides.====A number of recent papers have used quasi-experimental methods to isolate the effects of labor market shocks on mental health, all-cause mortality (Schwandt, 2018; Autor et al., 2018) and deaths of despair (Jou et al., 2018; Pierce and Schott, 2019). Carpenter et al. (2017) and Charles et al. (2018) find that economic downturns lead to increased intensity of prescription pain reliever use and to increases in substance use disorders or overdose involving opioids. Autor et al. (2018) find that labor demand shocks lead to premature mortality among young males, a large proportion of which is attributable to drugs and alcohol. These findings, together with a growing literature highlighting the adverse health effects of involuntary job loss (e.g., Sullivan and von Wachter, 2009; Eliason and Storrie, 2009), suggest that negative income shocks worsen health. In contrast, in a series of papers examining aggregate economic conditions and mortality, Ruhm, 2000, Ruhm, 2005 documents pro-cyclical trends in mortality, largely due to healthier individual behaviors such as decreased smoking and alcohol use during economic downturns. It is worth noting that suicides are found to be exceptions to this trend, and Ruhm finds the procyclical relationship to be weaker and even countercyclical for external causes of death in more recent years (Ruhm, 2015).====These contradictory findings are not surprising, given the theoretically ambiguous relationship between income and substance use. If drugs are normal goods, we would expect substance use (and potentially mortality) to increase with income. Petry (2000) finds a high income elasticity of demand for drugs among drug abusers. Moreover, some studies have found that positive income shocks tend to increase substance abuse deaths (Evans and Moore, 2011, Evans and Moore, 2012). Consistent with a positive income elasticity of alcohol, Adams et al. (2012) find that higher minimum wages increase the number of alcohol-related traffic fatalities for young drivers. Taken together, these studies point to an ambiguous relationship between income and mortality, in particular for drug- and alcohol related deaths.====More generally, a growing literature finds effects of economic policies on related health behaviors and outcomes. An emerging literature estimates effects of minimum wage on various health outcomes (see Leigh and Du, 2018; Leigh et al., 2019 for reviews). For example, Horn et al. (2017) find that minimum wage increases lead to reduced self-reported depression among women, but not among men. Expansions of the EITC have been found to significantly improve the health of mothers and birth outcomes, consistent with the positive health effects of the EITC found in the current study (Evans and Garthwaite, 2014; Hoynes et al., 2015).====The findings of this paper contribute to the debate on the determinants of deaths of despair, an epidemic to which working class non-Hispanic whites appear to be especially vulnerable. Case and Deaton suggest that the increase in deaths from alcohol, drugs and suicide in this population is largely attributable to despair driven by stagnant wages and long-term declines in economic opportunity, perpetuated by an inadequate and costly healthcare system and the unraveling of social institutions such as marriage and childbearing (Case and Deaton, 2020). Other scholars have questioned the explanatory focus on distress and economic despair (Roux, 2017; Ruhm, 2019; Masters et al., 2018), especially for drug-related deaths. These researchers point instead to the role of changing access to highly addictive and risky opioid drugs.====We are aware of only two studies that consider the relation between minimum wages and suicide, and we know of no studies analyzing effects of the EITC on deaths of despair. Using publicly available data, Gertner et al (2019) and Kaufman et al. (2020) estimate panel models linking age-adjusted suicide rates to state-level minimum wages. Their models indicate a significant negative association between minimum wages and suicide. While the findings in both papers are suggestive, their analysis stops short of credibly establishing a causal link (as the authors of each paper acknowledge). Neither paper examines drug or alcohol-related deaths.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the data used for our main analysis, while Section 3 presents our empirical models in some detail.

Community-based health interventions and ,"A substantial proportion of maternal deaths in low-income countries can be prevented through appropriate health care; however, the lack of primary health care use and provision still constitutes a barrier to achieve this goal (Dupas, 2011).==== Furthermore, maternal mortality rates are still persistent in contexts of high fertility and high unmet need for family planning (Cleland, Conde-Agudelo, Peterson, Ross, & Tsui, 2012). These issues are exacerbated in remote and rural areas where households need to walk long distances or incur high transportation costs to reach their nearest health center. Distance and time constraints can become significant household hassle costs for the take-up of primary health services (Adhvaryu & Nyshadham, 2015; Kremer & Glennerster, 2011; McLaren, Ardington, & Leibbrandt, 2014; Thornton, 2008). In fact, a longer geographic distance to the closest clinic is associated with poorer health outcomes (Baranov & Kohler, 2018; Karra, Fink, & Canning, 2016; Lucas & Wilson, 2017).====In remote and poor areas, community-based health interventions play a critical role in expanding access to primary health services and enhancing healthy behaviors thus empowering communities to actively improve their population health outcomes (Bhutta, Lassi, Pariyo, & Huicho, 2010; Lassi, Kumar, & Bhutta, 2016; WHO, 2011). Although the specific components of this type of interventions may vary across countries, community-based health programs usually encompass community mobilization efforts to disseminate health information and incentivize healthy practices and demand for services, as well as monitoring, supply and distribution of health commodities (Lassi et al., 2016). Additionally, a key component of community-based health interventions is the recruitment and training of local community health workers (CHWs) which can constitute an alternative to formal primary health care delivery services in remote villages (Bhutta et al., 2013; Singh & Sachs, 2013; Das, Chowdhury, Hussam, & Banerjee, 2016). Community-based health programs have been widely implemented in developing countries since the 1970s, and it is currently estimated that more than five million CHWs are present in Latin America, Asia and Africa (Perry, Zulliger, & Rogers, 2014).====Although there is growing evidence on the effects of community-based health interventions and CHWs on maternal and reproductive health (Arends-Kuenning, 2001; Phillips, Stinson, Bhatia, Rahman, & Chakraborty, 1982; Salehi‐Isfahani, Abbasi‐Shavazi, & Hosseini‐Chavoshi, 2010; Joshi & Schultz, 2013), most studies rely on small-scale randomized controlled trials or quasi-experiments in specific areas within a country. Therefore, little is known about whether this type of interventions implemented on a large scale can mitigate households’ hassle costs and improve women’s health outcomes.====This paper aims to fill this gap by examining the effects of a large-scale community-based health program that included the deployment of volunteer CHWs on fertility choices in Madagascar, one of the poorest countries in the world.==== The ==== program was implemented in 2009 and benefited half of the population of Madagascar by 2011, reaching 800 of 1,566 communes (the smallest administrative unit in the country). The program had two main components. First, at the commune level, ==== generated demand for preventive health care including family planning services through disseminating information (i.e., radio campaigns) and establishing supply points to ensure a steady and reliable supply of essential health commodities and medicines. Second, in each treated commune, two volunteer CHWs were deployed in remote areas, defined as villages located more than 5 kilometers (km) from the closest primary health clinic.==== One volunteer CHW specialized in maternal and reproductive health services, including promotion and provision of family planning, and the other volunteer worker focused on the promotion of child preventive health services. By making some specific and essential primary health services easily accessible and disseminating information to remote households, the program aimed to decrease the hassle costs imposed by the distance to the closest primary health clinic. Distance to health services is a salient issue in Madagascar as 65% of the population lives further than 5 km from the closest health facility (USAID, 2014).==== For instance, data before program implementation depicts that the more distant the households from the closest health center, the higher their unmet need for family planning and the lower their use of contraception.====In this paper, we examine the short-term effects of access to a large-scale community-based health intervention on women’s fertility choices, measured by the probability of conception. We exploit the quasi-experimental variation in the rollout of ==== across communes over time using a nationally representative survey, Madagascar’s Millennium Development Goals Survey (2013 ENSOMD). Our empirical strategy starts with a difference-in-difference specification that compares the average probability of conception between ==== and ====-==== communes before and after the program rollout. However, this specification does not take into account that the CHWs component of the program targeted households living in remote places from the health clinic. Therefore, our main identification strategy relies on a difference-in-difference-in-differences approach. We combine the geographic and time variation of the commune rollout of the program with a third difference, the exact distance from each household to the closest health facility. By combining precise household GPS locations with a national administrative census of the health centers (before program implementation), we identify remote households targeted by the CHWs component as those located more than 5 km from the closest health center.==== This empirical framework allows us to estimate the variation in the probability of conception before and after ==== rollout for remote relative to non-remote households in treated communes relative to comparison communes. To provide evidence of the validity of our empirical strategy, we show that, for the time period before ==== was introduced, fertility trends are similar across treated and non-treated communes as well as across treated and comparison remote areas. In addition, we perform several robustness checks and placebo regressions that validate our identification strategy, including evidence that selective migration does not confound our results.====Using the double difference model, we find that ==== reduced the quarterly probability of conception by 10%, with respect to the mean, among women living in ==== communes relative to women living in ==== communes. This overall effect of the program corresponds to a decrease of 9% in the total fertility rate. When estimating the triple difference model, we find that exposure to the program reduced the quarterly probability of conception by 12% with no statistically significant additional effect among women living in remote areas. We explore potential mechanisms for this fertility reduction and find that women are more likely to use family planning, particularly injectables, which is the most popular contraception method in the country. Indeed, ==== was the first public-sector community-based program to distribute this family planning method in Sub-Sahara Africa (Hoke et al., 2011). Furthermore, we find suggestive evidence that the program’s strategy of family planning dissemination through radio campaigns may have incentivized women’s family planning uptake which is consistent with the empirical evidence showing that information provision can influence preventive health behaviors (Cohen, Dupas, & Schaner, 2015; Dupas, 2011; Jalan & Somanathan, 2008; Madajewicz et al., 2007).====We acknowledge that we cannot rule out that supply-side factors related to CHWs’ potentially weak coverage and volunteer performance may explain the absence of additional effects on fertility outcomes in remote places. We lack comprehensive longitudinal data on the CHWs’ performance and monitoring across the years of the intervention to rigorously test this hypothesis. In fact, there is little empirical evidence on how to ensure volunteer CHWs’ high-performance in large-scale interventions in developing countries (Ashraf, Bandiera, & Lee, 2016; Shapira et al., 2018; Björkman Nyqvist, Guariso, Svensson, & Yanagizawa-Drott, 2019).====Our paper makes several important contributions to the empirical evidence on community-based health interventions and determinants of health and fertility behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first quasi-experimental evidence of the effects of a large-scale community-based health and volunteer CHWs intervention in a low-income country. While most empirical evidence on these programs comes from experimental studies in specific geographic areas within countries,==== our study is based on a recent large-scale community-based intervention that reached half of the population of Madagascar. Our study is most similar to those studies that have exploited the quasi-experimental design of the Matlab Child Health and Family Planning program, implemented by the end of the 1970s in Bangladesh, which show that this intervention reduced fertility and improved children’s health and education outcomes in the shortterm (Barham, 2012; Joshi & Schultz, 2013; Phillips et al., 1982).====We depart from these studies in that Matlab program reached 149 villages benefiting approximately 100,000 individuals in a specific sub-district in Bangladesh (Barham, 2012), while ==== reached 5,758 villages, benefiting approximately 11 million people. Empirical evidence on the effects of community-based health interventions and CHWs when implemented at scale is relevant as it can differ from that of small-scale interventions. For instance, the proof-of-concept results of controlled experiments might be attenuated by context dependence, political reactions, spillovers and other challenges of implementation at scale (Banerjee et al., 2017). There has been a push for a greater use of randomized experiments at scale (Muralidharan & Niehaus, 2017); however, governments usually do not randomize their rollout when implementing this type of large interventions. It is not surprising then that few rigorous quantitative studies analyze large-scale policies aiming to improve human capital in developing countries (Cameron, Olivia, & Shah, 2019). In this study, we take advantage of the geographic and time variation, combined with the distance to the closest health clinic to overcome this challenge and attempt to establish the effects of a large-scale community-based health program. Our results are policy relevant as ==== was recently incorporated into the government health policy and the adoption of these at-scale community-based health programs will presumably continue to grow in other low-income countries.====Furthermore, we analyze whether ==== a large-scale community-based health intervention that included volunteer CHWs, can mitigate the hassle costs imposed by the distance to the primary health facility and influence women’s fertility choices in a context where health insurance and other pecuniary costs are low (Adhvaryu & Nyshadham, 2015). Thus, we contribute to the empirical literature that analyzes whether non-monetary costs such as the convenience of access or hassle costs are important barriers to the take-up of preventive and primary health services (i.e., Wagner, Bosco, Dow, & Levine, 2017 and Kremer & Glennerster, 2011 for a review).====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the program and the data sources. Section 3 presents a conceptual framework that motivates our research question and guides our empirical strategy, while Section 4 explains the identification strategy, the double and triple difference models used to measure the short-term effects of ==== on fertility. Section 5 describes the results on fertility choices and the potential mechanisms through which the program affects the outcome of interest and Section 6 presents the robustness checks and placebo tests for our empirical results.

Our results show that less PB discretion — i.e. when mandatory reference prices apply — determines efficiency gains and losses for low- and high-skilled PBs, respectively.","This paper empirically investigates public procurement for medical devices in Italy, decomposing price variation into components explained by buyer ==== and buyer characteristics. The study period overlaps with a time when reference pricing was temporarily imposed at a national level, allowing examination of the heterogeneous effects of the policy on different buyers.====, ====, ====).====In Italy, as in many other national health systems in Europe, the procurement of medical technologies is managed at the local level. Occasionally, the national press has reported prices differences for the same standard medical device (e.g. a simple syringe) paid by different PBs (public hospitals and healthcare units).==== In a period of tight public budgets, this evidence has fuelled an extensive public debate and – in 2012 – led to the introduction of ====, a policy imposing a cap on the unit price of each standard medical device procured by tender. The aim of this policy was to limit PB discretion in an attempt to reduce public procurement expenditure. Reference prices for medical devices were applied from July 1, 2012 to May 2, 2013 and were then scrapped after a ruling of the Administrative Court of Rome. This provides a quasi-natural experimental setting for a clean test on how PB discretion affects the procurement of medical devices.====Based on procurement data,==== this paper initially estimates the net contribution of PB competence to price variability and then assesses how reference prices, which reduce PB discretion, interact with that competence. Our analysis was run on an original Italian dataset including 76 classes of standard medical devices sold to 131 local PBs between January and December 2013. The empirical approach is based on two important features of the medical devices investigated: i) they are standardised and relatively cheap, so renegotiations are rare; ii) they are grouped into classes of functionally homogeneous products (i.e. in each class, quality differentiation is not an issue). Given these features, a semiparametric approach is adopted, inspired by ====, to recover the marginal cost of each device. Using the official classification provided by the Italian technical advisor for health policies (AGENAS), we group functionally homogeneous medical devices into classes and, for each class, establish its benchmark marginal cost. We then show empirically that most of the discrepancy between purchasing prices and estimated costs is related to the PB fixed effect. This way, we infer a ==== for PB competence in managing each purchase. The main estimate is repeated, in the spirit of ====, using device fixed effects rather than marginal costs, obtaining similar results. Hence, the findings are not specific to the structural approach used to infer the marginal cost of medical devices. As a further step in the analysis, the determining factors of PB competence are investigated based on balance sheet data from local public hospitals and healthcare units. Finally, the exogenous termination of the reference price policy is used to identify its impact on the competence of PBs.====Our main findings are summarised below. First, the average prices of standard medical devices paid by Italian local public hospitals and healthcare units vary substantially. Second, the differences between PB purchase prices can be explained by PB fixed effects, which, in turn, are related to the size and characteristics of the PB. Specifically, size (measured either via overall personnel costs or by the procurement of health-related materials) has a generally positive and significant effect on competence in managing procurement efficiently. Furthermore, the ratio of non-health personnel over total personnel costs drives the overall positive and significant effect of size on PB competence. By contrast, once PB size has been accounted for, overall procurement expenses for health-related goods push competence down, in line with the definition of PB competence we adopted in this paper. Regarding organizational characteristics, our results indicate significant differences in purchasing medical technology between local public healthcare units and hospitals, with higher prices paid for standard medical devices by the former.==== between PBs, with observations moving towards an average value. In a period in which, in many countries, regulatory policies for medical device are often set to improve procurement efficiency, such a non-linear effect calls for the careful adoption of measures that evenly affect PBs in the healthcare system and their discretion in managing purchasing procedures.==== investigate the prices of standard medical devices following the introduction of a strict monitoring policy for hospital purchases in Buenos Aires. They estimate a 10% reduction in the average prices paid by hospitals because of the crackdown.====, ====, ====). Our work differs from these as our empirical strategy is able to isolate the net effect of reference prices on PB discretion and, in turn, on public expenditure.====Second, we add to the literature on the role played by PB competence==== to purchase goods or services and on the related regulation policies. By investigating procurement performance as related to the competence of the public workforce, a recent work by ==== estimated that 60% of within-product purchase price variation over 16 million purchases was due to bureaucratic (in)competence. Moreover, investigating a specific procurement policy which sets preferences for domestic firms, these authors show that its optimal design depends on how effective the purchasers are in implementing the policy itself. To these studies, we add the novel approach of measuring PB competence and its effects in managing the procurement of standard devices in the healthcare sector.====Finally, we contribute to the literature on medical technology procurement (====; ====, ====, ====, ====; ====; ====) by focusing on standard medical devices and the determinants of purchasers’ competence in managing a highly regulated process, partly by investigating the effect of a reference price regime.====The remainder of the paper is organised as follows: Section ==== describes the institutional setting (====) and our dataset (====), presenting some preliminary evidence (====).

Specifically, prior to October 2006, affected ==== individuals’ health care utilization. The results emphasize the effectiveness of behavioural interventions in health policy making.","In 2002, Thailand achieved universal health care coverage for the entire population by introducing the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) for people who did not benefit from the Social Security Scheme (SSS) or the Civil Servant Medical Benefit Scheme (CSMBS). Since 2002, there have been substantial debates about the availability and usage of health care by different insurance groups. In this paper, we aim to evaluate a recent change in the provider payment (billing) method that has occurred for the CSMBS group. The policy change is a shift from fee-for-service reimbursement towards fee-for-service direct disbursement for outpatient services. In particular, prior to the policy change in October 2006, patients had to pay the full cost of outpatient care and were reimbursed later, but after the policy change, providers could be paid directly by the government without the patients incurring any cost. This change does not affect the price, which, therefore, allows us to examine the impact of a non-price change on health care utilization. In particular, the non-price change might affect outpatient utilization by (i) reducing waiting time and administrative costs of reimbursement, (ii) reducing the risk of the previously uncertain reimbursement process and (iii) relaxing the liquidity constraint of individuals. Our goal in this paper is to assess the impact of this unique policy reform in Thailand on outpatient care use.====An established stream of literature examines the impacts of health insurance on health care utilization (see, for example, Buchmueller et al., 2005; Giedion and Díaz, 2010; Li and Zhang, 2013; Gruber et al., 2014) and generally shows that health insurance improves access and use. These studies particularly focus on reforms that introduce or affect the cost-sharing mechanism for health care. In this paper, we examine a policy change that does not alter the price of health care but revises the billing process. The new billing process aims to lessen liquidity constraints of low-income patients because patients in new regime no longer need to pay in advance as previously required. In developing countries, there is significant proportion of population that experience with catastrophic out-of-pocket health spending (see Wagstaff et al. (2018a,b)) or become impoverish as a result of out-of-pocket spending (see van Doorslaer et al. (2006) and Wagstaff et al. (2018a,b)). Thus, with this new billing process, it could help to ease liquidity constraint especially for those who are at the borderline of experiencing catastrophic health spending or who are close to or already fall below the poverty line to get the care they need. Hence, understanding the impact of billing process provides valuable input in health care policy making in developing countries where substantial part of population is cash-constraint. Furthermore, the uniqueness of these changes contributes to the international literature, particularly the literature addressing the ongoing debate about the accessibility and utilization of health care systems. To the best of our knowledge, there are no international studies that examine the impact of a non-price change in the billing process on health care utilization. To this end, our paper evaluates potential cost-effective non-price changes that impact the billing process.====By utilizing nationally representative micro-data and employing a difference-in-difference methodology, with the control group being SSS and UCS beneficiaries, we show that this non-price change has a moderate impact on health care utilization in Thailand. Our results also suggest that this change has persistent and long-lasting impacts and, particularly, larger effects for individuals who are likely to be liquidity constrained. By contrast, the effects are smaller for high-income, highly educated and urban populations. These findings emphasize the importance of simple behavioural interventions in health care policy making.====This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly describes the health care system in Thailand and the policy change in detail. This section also provides a brief overview of previous research and discusses the theoretical underpinnings of the potential behaviour change in individuals incentivized by the change from reimbursement to disbursement. Section 3 presents the research methodology and explains how it can be operationalized to measure the impact that we attempt to study.

Advocates argue that charging even minimal fees can reduce the use of health services, screen out disadvantaged individuals who are in most need of such services, and collect only limited revenue to ensure sustainability of the health system (Kremer and Holla, 2009; Pearson, 2004; Yates, 2009). However, opponents argue that charging fees can prevent needless use of services by (1) screening out individuals with lower valuations of the services than the fees charged (Oster, 1995) and (2) fostering adherence to health services as a result of having incurred sunk costs and/or associating the fees paid with better quality (Thaler, 1980; Bagwell and Riordan, 1991). Therefore, the expected effects of eliminating health fees on healthcare access and health status are ambiguous and ultimately become an empirical question.====Meta-analyses by Lagarde and Palmer (2008) and Hatt et al. (2013) suggest that while eliminating health fees increases healthcare use, this policy might also negatively impact quality due to understaffed facilities, longer waiting times, and scarcity of drugs and medical supplies. The few existing studies on the causal effects of this policy on health status come from Africa, with a focus, due to policy design, on either pregnant women or children. Tanaka (2014) found that the elimination of user fees in South Africa led to substantial improvements in weight-for-age z-scores among newborns and children under 8 years old. McKinnon et al. (2015a) and McKinnon et al. (2015b) document increases in facility-based births and declines in neonatal mortality in Ghana, Senegal, and Sierra Leone. Fitzpatrick (2018), focusing on 10 African countries that eliminated maternal user fees, found increases in births at public health facilities with skilled attendants, but did not find conclusive evidence on neonatal mortality.====However, to our knowledge, there is no causal evidence on the effects of eliminating health user fees beyond the African context and among working-age adults. The focus on working-age adults is relevant for policy because limited healthcare access can result not only in deteriorating health outcomes, but also in losses in productivity and declines in economic growth. As such, it is relevant not only to assess whether eliminating user fees affects health status, but also whether and how it affects time utilization and labor supply. Accordingly, this paper exploits a nationwide policy change in Jamaica to estimate the causal effects of eliminating user fees in public health facilities on the health and labor market dynamics of working-age adults.====The Jamaican experience started in April 2008 when the government passed a no-user-fee policy applicable to all public health facilities. This policy mandated that Jamaicans no longer had to pay for healthcare services such as doctor visits, diagnostic services, emergency room services, hospital admissions, surgeries, medications, physiotherapy, ambulance services, and maternal services. Prior to this policy, public health facilities charged out-of-pocket fees for these services. The rationale behind this policy change was that user fees were regressive and prevented access to healthcare access for disadvantaged sectors of the population that could not afford the fees (Jamaican Ministry of Health, 2008).====Disentangling causality is problematic because preexisting trends that are unrelated to the policy can confound simple comparisons of before versus after the program. We circumvent this problem by exploiting repeated yearly cross-sections of individual-level, nationally representative surveys from 2002 until 2012 within a difference-in-differences strategy. This approach controls for time-invariant unobservable characteristics at the district level and for sociodemographic characteristics and exploits two sources of variation. The first source is the timing of the policy change (i.e., before versus after adoption of the policy), while the second is the cross-sectional individual-level variation in the availability of health insurance. Uninsured individuals (83 percent of the population in Jamaica) serve as the treatment group because health fees that they otherwise would have paid out of pocket were eliminated in public health facilities. The control group is comprised of insured counterparts, as they already enjoyed access to private medical care before adoption of the policy and continued to do so after policy enactment. The validity of this approach is seen in the fact that the analysis found neither crowd-out from nor crowd-in into private health insurance or the use of private health services after policy adoption. In addition, trends in the main outcomes of interest were parallel between treatment and control groups before enactment of the policy; results are robust when considering an alternative empirical strategy based on a regression discontinuity design; and results are confirmed when using a restricted individual-level panel covering three consecutive years from 2007 to 2009 (one year before policy adoption and two years after policy enactment).====The main findings suggest no general effects either on health status or labor supply among individuals within the 21–39 age range.==== However, among individuals within the 40–64 age range, there is evidence of a reduced likelihood of suffering illnesses associated with the inability to carry out normal activities equivalent to 3.8 percentage points (or 33 percent with respect to the baseline mean). At the intensive margin, the number of days when people were unable to perform normal activities due to illnesses suffered within the previous four weeks decreased by 0.35 days (equivalent to 44.3 percent with respect to the baseline mean). These effects were concentrated on reduced relapses from existing chronic diseases (as opposed to reduced occurrence of illnesses not associated with existing chronic diseases) and on women (who were relatively less healthy than men at baseline). The reduced number of relapses from chronic illnesses is consistent with increased access to medical treatment and medications. The differential effects for women completely closed the baseline gender health gap.====Therefore, based on existing evidence exploring the relation between health and labor supply, these positive health effects among the relatively older working-age population could have translated into an increased labor supply (Strauss and Thomas, 1998; Currie and Madrian, 1999; Thomas et al., 2006; Stephens and Toohey, 2018). A particularly relevant study suggesting that this is a possibility within the context of our findings is Garthwaite (2012), who documents negative labor supply effects on older Americans following the removal of Vioxx (a pharmaceutical used for the treatment of chronic pain and inflammation) from the U.S. market. Therefore, our finding of reduced relapses from chronic diseases, which was likely mediated by the increased accessibility to medications, could have positively impacted labor supply.====At the extensive margin, we find no effects on employment or on the likelihood of contributing to the social security system (a measure of labor formality). However, consistent with a reduced number of days lost due to illnesses within the 40–64 age range, we find a positive effect of 3.04 additional weekly labor hours. In addition, consistent with the relatively stronger health effects for women, we also find a relatively larger female labor supply effect (3.73 weekly labor hours). Overall, health benefits and subsequent increases in the labor supply of adults in the 40–64 age range are consistent with the fact that this group was relatively disadvantaged at baseline regarding its health status. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that the policy added a yearly average of PPP US$28.44 million worth of net real production to the Jamaican economy during the 2008–2012 period.====This study makes several contributions to the international literature. First, the Jamaican policy did not have any demographic targeting mechanism. This allows for studying effects on the economically active population (21–64 years old), which contrasts with previous studies focusing, due to policy design, on maternal and child health (Tanaka, 2014; McKinnon et al., 2015a, b; Fitzpatrick, 2018). Second, the policy did not include targeting mechanisms related to employment or formality status, and formal employment in Jamaica is not tied to any public or private health insurance scheme. As such, and as we show empirically, there were no incentives to switch from the formal to the informal sector to benefit from the policy. This enables an assessment of whether the policy affected health status and labor supply while maintaining the degree of labor market formality constant. To our knowledge, no study has assessed the effects of introducing free public healthcare without any targeting provisions on both the health status and labor supply of working-age adults. This is relevant because, although recent studies have shown that expanding healthcare coverage during pregnancy and early childhood convey long-term benefits in labor market outcomes observed in adulthood (Brown et al., 2020; Miller and Wherry, 2019; Miller et al., 2018; Luhrmann and Wilson, 2018), potential short-term gains of increasing healthcare access among working-age individuals by abolishing user fees could also convey previously undocumented benefits in terms of labor supply.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the health system and the no-user-fee policy adopted in Jamaica. Section 3 describes the data. Section 4 presents the empirical strategy. We present our results in Section 5.

However, health conditional on age has also improved substantially, and life expectancy at advanced ages has seen large increases. Entitlement programs for the elderly have only recently begun to adjust to these changes. In England, the state pension age has been constant for men since 1925, while life expectancy for British citizens at age 50 has increased from 75 in 1955 to 82.6 in 2011 (Human Mortality Database). Similarly in the United States, the age for full retirement benefits under social security has increased just one year since the program's inception in 1935, while life expectancy at age 50 has increased by 8.8 years (CDC). This trend has led policymakers to consider and implement increases in the normal retirement age as governments face budget shortfalls due to an increase in the average duration of retirement.====These policy debates have spurred an increased interest in the link between retirement and health outcomes. Leaving the labor force releases many individuals from day-to-day sources of stress and greatly increases leisure time. In the cross section, however, health deteriorates with age, and acute changes to health can push individuals into retirement earlier than expected. This interdependence has made it difficult to accurately assess what effect retirement has on lifestyle and health outcomes, and the direction of this relationship is theoretically ambiguous. Providing labor is often stressful and taxing, and relieving an individual of this burden may improve the individual's health (Ekerdt et al., 1983). Yet it may also be the case that retirement leads to a loss of well-being, as individuals often lose the social network of their coworkers and may feel less useful to society (Szinovacz et al., 1992). Empirical studies that adjust for observable differences have often found negative effects of retirement, but some researchers have found positive effects as well.==== More recently, researchers have attempted to disentangle this relationship using variation in retirement probabilities induced by pension rules (Kofi Charles, 2004, Gorry et al., 2016), early retirement incentives (Kuhn et al., 2010, Bloemen et al., 2017, Hernaes et al., 2013, Hallberg et al., 2015), or cross-country differences (Coe and Zamarro, 2011), yet results have been inconclusive, with some finding beneficial effects of retirement and others showing starkly detrimental effects – including on the short-term likelihood of mortality.====I contribute to the literature by comprehensively tracing out the effect of reaching retirement age on individual's lifestyles, health care utilization, health outcomes, and chances of mortality. I focus on England due to a clearly defined age-based pension rule and a lack of any confounding programs in the same age range. In particular, retirement does not coincide with a change in access to or cost of health care, there is no early state pension age that may induce a portion of the population to retire at a different age, and pension collection rules align with most other countries in that eligibility is dependent on age rather than labor force decisions. This setup lends itself to applying a regression discontinuity design around the pension age. By using a multitude of data sources – including census data, inpatient records, large cross-sectional and longitudinal surveys, and mortality records – I am able to provide both precise estimates and multiple estimates for the same outcomes, ensuring robustness of results. As such, I am able to provide a comprehensive view of the short- to medium-term transition individuals face upon reaching the pension age.====I break the causal chain of retirement into four stages. The standard first stage is to verify reaching the state pension age increases the probability of retirement. Next, I examine behavioral and environmental changes that could affect an individual's health status. This includes health behaviors – such as smoking, drinking, exercising, and regular contact with friends and family – along with health care utilization, the change in environment of daily activity, and the additional income from the state pension. Following this, I investigate health outcomes, which can be split into self-reported measures, such as reported well-being and general health, and objective measures, such as inpatient admissions, scores on cognitive tests, and vital signs. The final step is mortality. While it is clear some of these outcomes will be more sensitive to rapid change upon leaving the work force, these classifications are useful for analyzing the mechanisms through which retirement can change an individual's health status.====Recent quasi-experimental studies provide an ambiguous picture of what effects retirement should have on health. Kofi Charles (2004) and Neuman (2008) use age-specific cutoffs as instruments for social security in the U.S., finding a positive effect on self-reported well-being, but no effect on health outcomes. Conversely, Coe and Zamarro (2011) use cross-country variation in pension rules in Europe and find a strong positive effect on health outcomes but null effects on health behaviors. Bloemen et al. (2017) and Hallberg et al. (2015) use targeted retirement programs that induced early retirements, with both finding positive effects on mortality rates. In contrast, Kuhn et al. (2010) also uses exogenous access to early retirement and find ==== effects on mortality rates, while Hernaes et al. (2013) do not find an effect in either direction. In the closest application to the methodology applied here, Weemes Grøtting and Lillebø (2018) find no effect on health care utilization and mortality in Norway. In the U.S., Gorry et al. (2016) use the social security eligibility age and eligibility for employer pensions as instruments to show that retirement improves both health and life satisfaction. Alarmingly, however, using the same population and age in an RD setting, Fitzpatrick and Moore (2018) find that retirement induces a sharp increase in mortality rates. This result in particular suggests that retirement can induce short-term changes to health behaviors and outcomes.====Various factors could result in these seemingly contradictory estimates, especially the application of different research designs to different populations in different countries. Further, these papers often face data limitations that impact estimation and institutional factors that impact identification. Thus, instead of focusing on a narrow set of outcomes, this paper seeks to trace out the outcomes in the causal chain of retirement and health within a unified context. Using multiple data sources for contemporaneous cohorts of retirees in the U.K., I mimic the methods utilized in previous works to generate a rich picture of the transition an individual faces when leaving the work force. This integration of administrative records and comprehensive surveys from the same population allows for both a much larger sample size and robustness checks not available to other researchers.====I first find that reaching the state pension age induces a large portion of the English population to retire. This effect is somewhat larger for men than for women, with the latter able to collect the state pension at a younger age. Further, this effect is nearly twice as large for those without post-secondary education.====I show that that retirement substantially improves individuals’ self-reported health. I find that retirement reduces the proportion of people that report being in poor health, and the probability that they report having a persistent health problem. This result is significant across data sets and robust to specification changes.====Next, I investigate potential sources of this abrupt improvement. I find no evidence of an immediate change in health care utilization, and limited evidence of positive effects in health behaviors such as frequent exercise, smoking, and social contact. In contrast with previous results, I find no evidence of an immediate change in cognitive and memory scores. I do, however, show that individuals show signs of lower stress in both subjective and objective measures, and that they report higher life satisfaction. I further show that they substitute their time from working into sleep and leisure. Congruent with these results, death certificate data show that there is no effect of retirement on mortality. Finally, I examine the characteristics of the complier group – i.e. those that wait until the pension age to retire – to better describe the types of individuals are driving these results.====These results advance the understanding of the relationship between retirement and health in several important ways. The first is that individuals clearly report better health after retirement, but show little movement in key outcomes such as utilization, cognitive ability, and mortality. This confirms recent studies showing that the negative correlation between retirement and health is an artifact of the endogeneity of the retirement decision, and suggests that the effect is due to substituting leisure and sleep for labor rather than healthy behavioral changes by the individual. This fits with a large neuroscience literature on long-term effects of stress on overall health, as well occupational health studies that have long shown the association with stress and impaired sleep.====Next, this paper shows that many results are sensitive to data source and research design, and my approach allows for extensive robustness checks. While England provides an ideal setting for this research question with a public pension similar to many other countries, country-specific effects cannot be ruled out. Furthermore, the fact that this sensitivity exists even within a country indicates that studies using a specific data source should be interpreted cautiously when discussing external validity. Finally and perhaps most importantly, the approach taken in this paper provides a clear framework to think about how retirement could affect the most salient health outcomes, such as mental health, utilization, and mortality. Without negative effects in health behaviors and health outcomes, it is difficult to conceive of a mechanism that would cause retirement to be linked to cognitive decline or increased mortality rates in a short- to medium-term time frame.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 examines previous work on the link between retirement and health, and provides institutional background on the state pension. Section 3 details the data sources used and identification strategy.

We study the relationship between ====. The evidence is generally consistent with the channel of environmental pollution through increases in contaminant levels in waters surrounding the live impact area.,"Militaries around the world perform training exercises in preparation for war and, in general, they take place “at home”. The U.S. is no exception. As of 2001, approximately 950 formerly used defense sites (FUDS) located across the country associated with former military training ranges contained defense-related hazards such as unexploded ordnance and other explosive wastes. These sites represent health hazards to local populations exposed to contaminants and military debris (U.S. General Accounting Office, 2001).====Surprisingly, there is very limited research documenting the impacts of these military training exercises on the livelihoods of nearby populations. Given that these training exercises continue to take place around the world (Korea, Japan, Iraq to name but a few), we would benefit from a better understanding of the potential consequences of these practices on health and socioeconomic outcomes of nearby populations — often vulnerable groups in society.====This study exploits a case study to provide evidence regarding the effects of these military exercises on the health outcomes of nearby populations. Over the span of six decades (1941–2001), the U.S. Navy utilized two-thirds of the territory of Vieques, Puerto Rico, to host a range of military exercises (including ship-to-shore gun fire, air-to-ground bombing by naval aircraft, and Marine amphibious landing) 12.5 km away from residential population. Studying this setting allows us to explore whether exposure to military training in fact has consequences for the health and safety of nearby populations, including the health at birth for children exposed ====.==== We study whether the abrupt end of naval practices in July 2000 had short-term consequences for infants’ health outcomes. To do so, we combine monthly data on tonnage of ordnance used in these naval exercises with the universe of births in Puerto Rico between 1990 and 2003.==== This allows us to study the relationship between ==== exposure to these military exercises and children’s early-life health outcomes. Specifically, we examine infant health outcomes for cohorts conceived following the end of naval practices relative to those conceived in the preceding period within the municipality affected by bombings, and to those newborns conceived in municipalities not affected by the bombings. Our identification is therefore across treatment and control municipalities over time.====The military exercises have significant negative consequences for early life outcomes — particularly for congenital anomalies. The sudden end of bombing practices is associated with a 5.6–7.9 per thousand (56–79%) decrease in the incidence of congenital anomalies as the main driver for improvements in neonatal health outcomes. We do not find robust evidence of improvements in other measures of neonatal health. We find direct support for the channel of environment pollution using data from U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Discharge Monitoring Reports by the Atlantic Fleet Weapons Training Facility (U.S. Navy) of inorganic chemicals such as arsenic, cyanide, and lead, in waters surrounding the live impact area. In particular, bombing activity leads to short-term increases in pollutant levels in waters surrounding the live impact area: a one standard deviation increase in average ordnance levels leads to a 0.3 of a standard deviation increase in overall pollution levels. Given that pollution exposure has been linked to increased frequency of spontaneous abortions and congenital malformations (Almond and Currie, 2011; Nordstrom et al., 1979; Hopenhayn-Rich et al., 1999) this evidence is suggestive of a link between water pollution resulting from the bombing activity and infant health outcomes. In contrast, we do not find evidence that possible disruptions in economic activity mediate these effects. The evidence thus supports the hypothesis that reductions in environmental pollution and other environmental factors lead to a substantial reduction in the risk of congenital anomalies among the infant population (Currie et al., 2011a, 2011b).====Our study makes several contributions to the health, conflict, and human development literature. Prominent research on the effects of exposure to conflict for early-life and long-term outcomes document a link that is most plausibly explained by economic channels and changes in stress as well as mental and physical health of the adult population.==== We demonstrate that an important plausible channel in the context of certain conflicts is one of an environmental nature, consistent with a complementary literature that analyzes how environmental factors that occur during the prenatal period have significant early life and long-term consequences (Almond and Currie, 2011). The study also has important implications for both child policy and military policy. Infant health outcomes such as congenital anomalies and low birth weight are important predictors of child health (McCormick, 1985; Pollack and Divon, 1992; Almond et al., 2005) and long-term outcomes such as educational attainment, labor market outcomes, and adult health (Currie and Hyson, 1999; Behrman and Rosenzweig, 2004; Black et al., 2007). Given the well-documented relationship between neonatal health and later life outcomes, there is reason to believe that our substantial short-term effects may have longer-term consequences for this population. Moreover, previous research has documented the effects of both maternal stress and environmental pollution on infant health (c.f. Currie et al., 2009) and our evidence strongly suggests that at least one of these channels is responsible for the detrimental effects on child health that we find here. Since the shutdown of the U.S. Navy in Vieques in 2001 formalized the start of a negotiation between the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the U.S. for an ecological and economic restoration strategy for the island, these findings have implications to expand the discussion to address child health and child development dimensions.====The paper is organized as follows. Section II provides background on U.S. Navy Activities in Vieques and the possible implications for health outcomes among the resident population. We follow with a description of the data and the empirical methodology in Section III. We present the central empirical results of the paper in Section IV. In Section V we explore potential mechanisms, followed in Section VI by a series of robustness tests and a discussion of potential impacts on other health outcomes. The paper concludes in Section VII with a discussion of findings and their broad implications.","Military training exercises, pollution, and their consequences for health",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629618311548,18 June 2020,2020,Research Article,212.0

While we find no impact of ","A key focus of health economics research in recent years has been the role of health systems in promoting health (McGovern et al., 2014). One aspect of this debate concerns the impact of health insurance on population health (Gruber and Sommers, 2019). Ill-health is often unpredictable, both in terms of financial costs and physical and emotional suffering. This necessitates a role for insurance in offering the patient protection against uncertainty. Most developed countries provide publicly-financed insurance for many health services for their populations, although there is considerable heterogeneity in the extent to which different population groups are covered (the 'breadth' of cover), what healthcare services are covered (the 'scope' of cover) and the extent of patient cost-sharing (the 'height' of cover) (Evetovits et al., 2012). The literature on whether insurance/cost-sharing has causal impacts on health is often inconclusive (Rice and Matsuoka, 2004), and in particular, credible evidence focused on the older population is scarce (Shigeoka, 2014).====Ireland provides a valuable test case of the impact of insurance/cost-sharing on health. The current Irish system of healthcare financing relies predominately on public sources of finance, with smaller contributions from private health insurance and direct out-of-pocket payments by individuals. While the proportion of overall out-of-pocket contributions to total healthcare financing is comparable with other EU countries (OECD, 2013), for certain services they are much more significant than is the case elsewhere (Evetovits et al., 2012). In particular, the use of direct out-of-pocket payments to finance general practitioner (GP) care by the majority of the population is unusual in a European context (Kringos et al., 2013). All Irish residents are entitled to free or subsidised public hospital services and prescription medicines, but only those with incomes below specified thresholds (or in certain age categories) are entitled to free GP care. Previous research has demonstrated significant impacts of this system on healthcare utilisation (Madden et al., 2005; Nolan, 2007; Ma and Nolan, 2017), but less research exists on the impact of this system on health outcomes. The current national strategy for healthcare reform, ====, commits to the introduction of a universal healthcare system, underpinned by a public health insurance system (Burke et al., 2018). The first steps towards universal coverage occurred in 2015, when free GP care was extended to all those aged under 6, and 70+, regardless of their financial situation. We use the over 70s policy change to identify the causal impact of public health insurance on psychological health, an aspect of health that not been the focus of previous research.====The WHO defines health as ‘a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity’.==== In 2010 it was estimated that the category of ‘mental and substance use disorders’ was the leading cause of all non-fatal burden of disease, accounting for 22.9 per cent of all years lived with a disability globally. Depressive and anxiety disorders accounted for over half of these cases (Whiteford et al., 2013). Despite the increasing focus on mental or psychological health==== as an important component of overall health and wellbeing (Department of Health, 2013), the majority of research on the effect of (public) health insurance on health focuses on physical health outcomes such as self-reported health, clinical indicators such as hypertension, and mortality (Gruber and Sommers, 2019). Flavin (2018) and Ayyagari and Shane (2015) discuss a number of potential mechanisms by which health insurance may impact mental health. First, there is clear evidence that public health insurance is associated with improved self-reported health (Gruber and Sommers, 2019), and self-reported health is strongly associated with overall levels of wellbeing (Diener and Chan, 2011). Second, public health insurance reduces the risk of poverty and improves financial wellbeing (Wherry et al., 2016; Baicker et al., 2013), outcomes associated with mental health (Wickham et al., 2017). In addition, the income effect may encourage investment in activities that are beneficial for mental health. Third, having public health insurance can reduce feelings of anxiety and worry about what one will do if they or a loved one becomes sick or injured (Baicker et al., 2013) which, in turn, can lead to higher levels of mental health. A further mechanism is also possible, although the net effect on mental health is ambiguous: public health insurance may lead to enhanced access to diagnostic and treatment opportunities for mental health problems, some of which may have been previously undiagnosed.====In this paper, using data from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA), and exploiting a policy change that introduced free GP care for all individuals 70 years of age and over in August 2015, we evaluate the impact of free GP care on psychological health among the older population in Ireland and explore some of these potential mechanisms. Though limited impact is found for quality of life, life satisfaction, depression, and worry, the difference-in-differences (DID) estimates suggest that the level of perceived stress decreased by approximately 6% for all those over 70 years of age following the expansion of free GP care. Moreover, the impact is driven mainly by poorer, sicker and single individuals. The results hold for a series of robustness checks. Further analyses show supportive evidence that the removal of GP fees increases the probability of seeking GP care, and is also associated with less reported financial stress.====We contribute to the literature in the following ways. First, we have longitudinal data before and after the policy change to follow closely individuals who became eligible for free GP care after August 2015. Turning 70 in Ireland does not coincide with changes in any other major factors that would potentially affect psychological health (such as retirement or receiving a pension). This enables us to infer the causal impact of free access to GP care on psychological health. Second, we have a comprehensive list of measures of psychological health, including quality of life (measured by the CASP scale), life satisfaction, depression (measured by the CES-D score), worry (measured by the Penn Worry scale) and stress (measured by the Perceived Stress scale), available for a nationally-representative sample of the older population. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first analyses of the impact of public health insurance on psychological health among the older population. Third, we explore two potential mechanisms through which free GP care might affect stress. One is access to health services and the other is via financial stress.====The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a brief description of the institutional setting and reviews previous literature. Section 3 describes the data. Section 4 outlines the empirical strategy.

The effect is precisely estimated, which suggests that prenatal employment prior to the 32nd week of pregnancy does not causally affect the ==== for measures visible at birth.","Most high-income countries have seen a significant and steady increase in female labor force participation over the last decades. Therefore, women today are more likely to work while pregnant. At the same time, family policies have become much more generous with multifold goals such as gender equity, higher fertility, and better child development (Olivetti and Petrongolo, 2017). One family policy instrument is prenatal maternity leave, intended to protect both the health of the mother and the newborn. The duration of prenatal leave varies substantially—from 0 to 11 weeks—in European countries (Jurviste et al., 2016). This variation across countries mirrors the uncertainty among policy makers on how to optimally design such programs and on the role of maternal leave. In the fetal origins hypothesis literature, several pregnancy conditions have already been identified as key influencing factors on a variety of long-term outcomes of children. If prenatal maternal employment is among them, long-term benefits for the children may offset the costs of prenatal maternity leave. Therefore, understanding the effects of maternal employment during pregnancy on newborn health is key for policy makers who design policies concerning prenatal maternity leave.====There is a large body of literature estimating the effects of pregnancy conditions on newborn health and long-term outcomes of children as summarized by Almond and Currie (2011) and Almond et al. (2018). However, there is little evidence on the effect of prenatal employment on newborn health. This is critical because the prenatal maternal employment status combines several major aspects of pregnancy conditions such as stress, physical activity, disease environment, income, and others. In theory, the impact of prenatal employment is ambiguous. On the one hand, maternal employment during pregnancy may be stressful for the mother or may correlate with exposure to pollutants and diseases. These influences have been shown to be detrimental to the unborn baby (Aizer et al., 2015, Currie and Schwandt, 2013, Currie and Schwandt, 2016, Schwandt, 2018). On the other hand, employment may also increase a mother's income or may be a joyful activity itself, which therefore could improve newborn health (Almond et al., 2011, Hoynes et al., 2015).====This paper provides evidence on the net effect of changes in parental leave policy on newborn health by exploiting three reforms in Austria that affected both mothers’ likelihood of working during pregnancy with their second child and birth spacing between the first and the second child. While I discuss the potential bias on newborn health that can be introduced due to birth spacing effects, I argue that maternal work is the most prominent channel especially due to the strong effect sizes.====The three reforms on the duration of parental leave allow me to employ a regression discontinuity setting. In order to empirically analyze the impact of prenatal maternal employment, I use administrative data from the Austrian Social Security Database (ASSD), which contains the full work history for private-sector employees. This data set can be linked to the Austrian Birth Register (ABR), which covers all births with several indicators on newborn health and characteristics about mothers.====Parental leave policies in Austria consist of both a flat benefit and job protection. Beginning in 1990, there have been several reforms affecting the duration of parental leave. In 1990, parental leave was extended by one year, from 12 to 24 months. In 1996, this was partially reversed to 18 months, but increased to 30 months in 2000. These changes led to an easier automatic extension for another parental leave period upon the birth of an additional child—the so called ==== rule. This rule exempts mothers from working and therefore reduces a mother's probability of working during pregnancy with the second child.====I find no evidence of prenatal employment effects on newborn health. This holds true for a variety of outcomes measured via birth weight, gestational age, and Apgar scores. Thus, I cannot reject that there are no effects of maternal employment during pregnancy on newborn health, despite a strong first stage. Across all policy reforms, the duration of parental leave significantly affects the mother's employment status during pregnancy with her second child. The effect of the July 1990 reform, which increased parental leave by 12 months to 24 months, corresponds to a 19.1 percentage point decline in the share of mothers’ working during pregnancy. This effect is homogeneous over the entire first seven months of a pregnancy. A heterogeneity analysis reveals marginally different, but always significant, effects for a large set of subsamples stratified by a mother's marital status, occupational collar, and industry. However, I detected no significant effects on newborn health for any of these subsamples.====Significantly, the study is based on a large administrative sample that allows me to precisely estimate the effects and to rule out sizeable newborn health effect-patterns. Furthermore, all covariates vary smoothly around the cutoffs of the policy reform, which supports the interpretation of the regression discontinuity design. Finally, the results are robust to a variety of different specifications. For example, I test for different birth weight and gestational age thresholds, apply a Donut estimation to deal with delayed Caesarean sections, and implement a bounds estimator to control for selection.====This paper makes several contributions to the literature on pregnancy conditions on infant health and specifically, on prenatal maternal employment on infant health.==== Wüst (2015) employs Danish survey data in a regression analysis and finds positive effects for working mothers with closely spaced consecutive births or those who change their employment status due to educational reasons. Rossin (2011) analyzes the impact of unpaid maternity leave provisions in the United States and documents small increases in birth weight and a reduction in premature birth and infant mortality. Stearns (2015) studies time off from work during late pregnancy under a temporary disability insurance program. She finds beneficial effects for newborns of unmarried and black mothers. Ahammer et al. (2020) analyze a 1975 reform in Austria that extended prenatal maternity leave from six to eight weeks. They find no evidence for significant effects on newborn health. Finally, the study by Ginja et al. (2020) analyzes the effect of a speed premium in Sweden, analogous to the grace period in Austria. In their study, they address the effect of parental leave on family income, labor supply, and child health exploiting spacing eligibility cutoffs. They document a tiny decline in maternal employment during pregnancy with the second child of a 1–1.3 percentage point decrease in mothers’ participation in the year and the year before second birth. In line with my results, they also do not find effects on outcomes of the newborn measured at birth as a result of the speed premium. However, based on their close to zero impact on maternal work behavior during pregnancy with the second child, they have a different focus in their study.====My paper adds to this literature in the following ways. It is the first to provide clear evidence of the effect of maternal employment up to and including the seventh month of a pregnancy on the health of the newborn. This setting helps in understanding ==== in pregnancy time off might be most beneficial. While the previous literature almost exclusively concentrated on the work effect during the very end of a pregnancy, I am the first who can say something about the beginning of a pregnancy when many women not even know about their pregnancy. Combining my findings, that inform about the work effect starting from conception up to the seventh moth of a pregnancy, with the previous findings gives a complete picture about the whole pregnancy.====Using the described reforms for exogenous variation in prenatal maternal employment up to the 32nd pregnancy week generates a large and representative sample of compliers. This complements the existing literature on maternal employment during pregnancy on newborn health as I do not have to rely on differential take-up of welfare programs by rich and white mothers (as in the context of unpaid leave) or unmarried and black mothers (in the case of disability insurance).====Furthermore, I am able to use a large administrative data set on an individual basis that allows me to exactly identify the exposed mothers and their offspring. Based on this data set, I am the first who can calculate the exact number of days a mother is working during pregnancy. Significantly, this allows me to analyze the impact of prenatal employment on two margins—the extensive margin of mothers who choose to work or not during pregnancy and the intensive margin of working mothers—as I can factor in unusually detailed information on maternal employment histories. The richness of the data also makes it possible to analyze heterogeneous effects across mothers and by work environment.====Finally, in the Austrian context, the rich data can be combined with a diverse policy setting. I explore the impact of prenatal employment in three different points in time that allow me to both assess the effects of increases as well as decreases in employment during pregnancy. Variation in both directions allows for study of asymmetries in an already generous leave setting with strong changes in parental leave duration across the studied time period.====Overall, my results show that large changes in prenatal employment do not imply significant changes of newborn health. This suggests that parental leave policies should focus on parental leave after birth, given that time spent with parents during early childhood has been shown to be beneficial in a number of outcomes (Carneiro et al., 2015, Rossin-Slater, 2018, Heckman, 2007).====The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the Austrian parental leave system and the reforms used for this study. Section 3 develops a conceptual framework on how prenatal maternal employment can affect newborn health. Section 4 discusses the data and Section 5 presents the empirical strategy. Section 6 provides an overall assessment of the results and sensitivity analyses, which will be discussed in Section 7.

According to the WHO,==== the prevalence of overweight and obesity among children and adolescents aged 5-19 has risen dramatically from just 4% in 1975 to over 18% in 2016. This rise has affected in a similar fashion both boys and girls. The observed trend is a source of concern because obese children and adolescents are around five times more likely to be obese in adulthood than normal-weight children and adolescents.==== In addition, child and adolescent overweight and obesity have been found to significantly increase the risk of premature mortality and to be associated with significantly increased risk of later cardio-metabolic morbidity in adult life (Reilly and Kelly, 2011).====As argued by Cawley, 2004a, Cawley, 2011, if individuals were perfectly rational and their decisions about food and weight imposed no costs on others in society, if information about the consequences of obesity were accurate and readily available and there were no externalities, there would be no market failure and no reason for government intervention on efficiency grounds. When one or more of these assumptions are violated, however, the socially optimal level of obesity can differ from the one that prevails when individuals operate in free markets.====Cawley (2010) lists five economic factors explaining childhood obesity: food prices, agricultural policies, income, maternal employment and technology. Genes also matter, as small genetic differences at birth can affect both obesity risk, health and human capital formation==== and lead to substantial inequality in long-term social and economic outcomes (including productivity, wages and skill formation).====In this paper, we investigate whether adolescent and adult obesity are affected not only by individuals’ own genes, but also by the genes of peers the adolescents interact with in the same grade at school. Since peers’ genes are not observed, they cannot directly affect individuals’ obesity. However, peers’ genes can operate both via peers’ obesity and by influencing other peers’ traits and behaviours (e.g. smoking, eating and exercise habits) which may impact on individual behaviour.====Our research contributes to a growing literature that exploits the increased availability of genetic data to dig deeper into questions that are relevant for social scientists (Beauchamp et al., 2011, Benjamin et al., 2012, Conley and Fletcher, 2018) and to inquire whether the genetic makeup of individuals around us impacts our own outcomes (Domingue and Belsky, 2017, Sotoudeh et al., 2019, Cawley et al., 2019).==== This literature has shown that smoking, obesity, and other health indicators are shaped by the interaction between genes, environmental factors (Bierut et al., 2018, Barcellos et al., 2018, Boardman et al., 2012), and investment choices over the life-cycle (Biroli, 2015).====Previous research has also produced evidence of “genetic nurturing effects” within the family (Kong et al., 2018), showing that children's education is affected not only directly by the parental and maternal genetic variants they inherit, but also indirectly by the genes affecting the behaviour of individuals they interact with (parents, relatives, siblings). In particular, Cawley et al. (2019) investigate whether the probability of being obese is affected by siblings’ genetic predisposition to obesity, after controlling for one's own genetic predisposition to obesity. Their results suggest that there are no significant genetic nurture effects on obesity among siblings.====Our research is motivated by the scarce evidence to date on meta-genomic effects outside the family. Two important contributions in this field are Domingue et al. (2018), who document the presence of genetic similarities among school-based friends and schoolmates, and Sotoudeh et al. (2019), who show that a significant relationship exists between the genetic predisposition to smoking of an adolescent's grade-mates, classmates and school friends and the adolescent's smoking behaviour.====While these contributions focus on short-run effects, we investigate whether social-genetic effects on obesity at school last over time or fade away as adolescents grow into adulthood. We compare the impact of high school peers’ genetic predisposition to high BMI—measured with average BMI polygenic scores in the school and grade—on individual obesity both close to the time when social interactions occur (the short-run) and more than 10 years after grade completion (the long-run).====Estimating the causal effect of social interactions is challenging because of self-selection into peer groups, omitted common environmental factors, and the reflection problem (Manski, 1993). The fact that genes are determined before group formation solves both the common environment and the reflection problems. We address non-random assignment of individuals into peer groups by relying on the observation that the assignment of students to a grade within a school is as good as random, and by focusing on the genetic markers of grade-mates rather than on those of schoolmates or friends. We assess the validity of this identification strategy by showing that the actual within-school variation in average grade-mates’ genetic scores is not statistically different from the variation obtained using Monte-Carlo simulations.====We find that, in the short-run, grade-mates’ BMI polygenic scores have a positive effect on female adolescents’ obesity but no effect on male obesity.==== Using our preferred specification, we estimate that a one standard deviation increase in these scores raises the probability of obesity for females by 2.8% points, about half the size of the impact of a one standard deviation increase in their own polygenic scores. In the long-run, however, peers’ BMI polygenic scores have no effect on adult obesity, neither for males nor for females. We discuss potential mechanisms and argue that nutrition habits and a distorted perception of body size may help explain our short-run results for females.====We also estimate unconditional quantile regressions to explore how short-run social-genetic effects vary along the distribution of individual BMI. We find that, while females with high BMI are affected by their grade-mates’ BMI PGS, females whose BMI is around the median or below are unaffected. An implication of this finding is that, in the presence of genetic or weight-based homophily—documented by (Domingue et al., 2018, Crosnoe et al., 2008, De La Haye et al., 2011, Schaefer and Simpkins, 2014)—, the random assignment of individuals to groups (i.e., classes) may reduce—at least in the short-run—the prevalence of obesity among high BMI females without affecting those with low BMI.====Our results suggest that programs that prevent weight gain or facilitate weight loss could exhibit social multiplier effects by benefitting not only participants but also their peers, and that ignoring these effects might lead to under-estimating their cost-effectiveness.==== However, since we find that social-genetic effects dissipate as individuals reach adulthood, social multiplier effects in schools are likely to be short-lived.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

Between 2011 and 2014, almost 13 percent of Americans aged 12 and over reported using an antidepressant in the past month (Pratt et al., 2017). Prescription antidepressants are the most common treatment for depression and anxiety disorders, the diagnostic rates of which have also grown steadily over the last few decades (see Fig. 1).==== Among the many personal and societal consequences of these disorders, Ettner et al. (1997), and more recently Cronin et al. (2020), show empirically that mental illness can have a substantial negative impact on the labor market outcomes of affected individuals.==== For example, Ettner et al. (1997) estimate that individuals with a mental illness are roughly 13 percentage points less likely to work and that employed women with a mental illness earn 30 percent less annually than women without a mental illness.====The extent to which antidepressants protect the employment and productivity of those with depression and anxiety is an open question. Furthermore, it is unclear the extent to which government policy could or should impact labor market outcomes by promoting mental health treatment.==== We provide insight on these questions by analyzing the labor market effects of the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) 2007 expanded black box warning on antidepressants. A black box warning appears on a prescription drug's label (or package insert) and is meant to call attention to serious adverse or life-threatening side effects. It is the strongest warning required by the FDA. In October 2004, the FDA required that drug manufacturers of 36 antidepressants include a black box warning of increased risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) for children and adolescents. The warning was expanded on May 2, 2007 to incorporate the following three messages: (i) in addition to children and adolescents, antidepressants increase the risk of suicidality in young adults ==== with major depressive disorder and other psychiatric disorders; (ii) individuals 65 and older experience a ==== risk of suicidality while taking the drug; and (iii) patients of ==== who are started on antidepressant therapy should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior.====While a number of studies in the economics literature have examined the impact of the 2004 warning on antidepressant use, this study is the first to estimate the impacts of the 2007 expanded warning on prescription antidepressant utilization and the employment of affected individuals. If antidepressant use declined in response to the expanded warning, the labor market outcomes of those suffering from depression may have been affected. There are several reasons to expect, ====, that the expanded warning had important implications for antidepressant use among the prime working-age population. First, the 2007 expanded warning recommended that new patients of ==== receive enhanced monitoring. Second, while the warning of suicidality risk in 2004 explicitly targeted children and adolescents, the warning of suicidality risk in 2007 targeted young adults aged 18–24, a group that is more likely to be in the workforce. Last, several studies have found that adult antidepressant utilization fell in response to the 2004 warning (Olfson et al., 2008, Libby et al., 2009, Parkinson et al., 2014) even though that warning had no stated relevance for them. If adults older than 24 view drug-associated risks for young adults as more salient than risks for children and adolescents, it may be even more likely that prime-working age adults responded to the 2007 expanded warning.====We use cross-sectional data from the nationally representative National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) to estimate the reduced-form effects of the FDA's 2007 expanded black box warning on the employment of men and women aged 18–64. We use a difference-in-differences strategy that compares the employment of ever-depressed individuals, before and after the warning, to the employment of never-depressed individuals. We find that employment among ever-depressed women aged 35–49 decreased by 6.1 percent (4.4 percentage points) in response to the expanded warning. The warning did not have a significant effect on employment for ever-depressed men or for ever-depressed women outside the ages of 35–49. These results are robust to numerous alternative specifications.====To further understand these findings, we explore several mechanisms through which the 2007 expanded black box warning may have affected employment. We first study the most obvious mechanism, a decrease in antidepressant use, using the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS).==== Consistent with the employment effects reported above, we find that depressed women aged 35–49 were 19 percent (7.6 percentage points) less likely to use antidepressants in the eight months following the warning than they were prior to the warning, relative to similarly aged non-depressed women. Furthermore, we find no evidence that antidepressant use among depressed men aged 18–64 and among women outside the ages of 35–49 responded to the warning. In line with the warning's language regarding new antidepressant users, the decrease in use was stronger among new users than continuing ones. We then explore additional mechanisms, including changes in the use of other mental health treatments, such as psychotherapy and benzodiazepines (drugs with sedative properties typically prescribed for anxiety), and non-medical antidepressant substitutes, such as alcohol and marijuana. We find evidence of a decrease in psychotherapy use among depressed women aged 35–49 after the warning, suggesting complementarity between antidepressants and psychotherapy. Such complementarity is also implied by the structural model estimates in Cronin et al. (2020). We find weak evidence that the expanded warning increased benzodiazepine use, and it had no effect on alcohol consumption or marijuana use. Given the range of potential mechanisms underlying the employment response to the expanded warning, several of which we lack the data to explore (e.g., drug adherence), we focus on the reduced-form effects of the warning on employment, rather than exploit the warning as an instrument for antidepressant utilization.====Our estimates imply that the 2007 expanded black box warning had no impact on the targeted age group of 18–24 year olds. Instead, the warning led to a decline in antidepressant use and employment among women aged 35–49. Though the warning also applied to ==== antidepressant users, we recognize that these findings are somewhat unexpected.==== In Section 6, we discuss a number of explanations, and highlight the main ones here. First, numerous studies, including this one, document that females experience higher rates of depression than males, and that antidepressant use among middle-aged women is relatively high compared to men and younger females (Pratt and Brody, 2014, Blanchflower and Oswald, 2016, Pratt et al., 2017); thus, the 35–49 year old female subgroup likely contains a large fraction of marginal antidepressant users.==== Second, Avery et al. (2012) provides evidence that antidepressant advertising, which must divulge the black box warning, is largely targeted towards middle-aged women, meaning this subsample may have a greater awareness of the warning than men or younger cohorts of women. Third, we find that the impact of the warning on both antidepressant use and employment is strongest for married women, suggesting spousal health insurance and income may enable middle-aged women to respond more strongly to the warning than younger women. Finally, both Brodie et al. (2003) and Collins and Schmeiser (2010) document examples of young adults not following health-related news, which may partly explain the lack of response by 18–24 year olds.====Our results underscore that public health policies can have significant and potentially unintended consequences beyond health and clinical considerations. Regarding the FDA's 2007 expanded black box warning in particular, employment effects seem to be limited to depressed women in their mid-30s to late-40s. Given that these women were in their prime-working years, the overall economic impact is not trivial. In Section 6, we argue that, among other consequences, the warning decreased overall labor force participation by 0.23 percentage points and led to roughly $11.8 billion (in 2006 dollars) in lost wages in the following year. Given existing research showing that the 2004 black box warning actually ==== suicide rates (Gibbons et al., 2007, Busch et al., 2014) and worsened academic and behavioral outcomes for adolescents (Busch et al., 2014), our findings echo the concerns of other researchers regarding the efficacy and unintended consequences of the FDA's black box warnings on antidepressants.====Our paper contributes to the literature that studies the labor market effects of medical treatments and innovation (e.g., Thirumurthy et al., 2008, Papageorge, 2016, Cronin et al., 2020, Jeon and Pohl, 2019, Harris et al., 2020). One strand of this literature exploits treatment-related policy changes and information shocks to examine the relationship between medical treatments and employment. For example, Daysal and Orsini (2014) study the employment effects of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on middle-aged women by exploiting a negative information shock similar to the black box warning studied in this paper. Both Garthwaite (2012) and Bütikofer and Skira (2018) study the labor market effects of pain medication by exploiting the removal of Vioxx, a type of Cox-2 inhibitor, from the worldwide market in 2004 in response to information about adverse cardiac side effects. All three papers document substantial worsening of labor market outcomes following negative information shocks. Our focus on an antidepressant-related regulatory change and information shock is particularly important given the popularity of the drug class, as well as existing evidence that antidepressant users are responsive to information shocks. Namely, Shapiro (2018a) finds greater exposure to direct-to-consumer advertising of antidepressants significantly decreases missed days of work. Our research advances this literature by exploring a range of mechanisms through which the black box warning may have affected employment, such as the use of various mental health treatments and non-medical substitutes. Prior studies have either focused exclusively on labor market effects or, if they consider mechanisms, only consider changes in the use of the medical treatment most directly impacted by the regulatory change or information shock.====Like several of the papers mentioned above, our paper contributes to a broader literature on the economics of information, particularly that which focuses on responses to negative product information. In the pharmaceutical domain, evidence shows consumers and physicians respond to information provided via direct-to-consumer advertising, clinical studies, drug recalls, and FDA announcements and labeling changes (e.g., Azoulay, 2002, Cawley and Rizzo, 2008, Chintagunta et al., 2009, Dusetzina et al., 2012, Collins et al., 2013, Shapiro, 2018b). For example, Cawley and Rizzo (2008) and Collins et al. (2013) show prescription drug withdrawals lead to reduced utilization of remaining drugs within the same therapeutic class. Dusetzina et al. (2012) review the literature on the impact of FDA drug risk communications and find drug-specific warnings are associated with large decreases in utilization. Among this literature are several papers that study responses to the FDA's 2004 black box warning on antidepressants (e.g., Busch et al., 2010, Parkinson et al., 2014).==== Our paper advances this literature by focusing on the 2007 expanded warning and estimating the indirect employment effects of the warning. In an important paper, Busch et al. (2014) study indirect effects of the 2004 warning, also using annual cross-sectional data from the NSDUH. The authors estimate the impact of the warning on academic and behavioral outcomes of adolescents aged 12–17 with probable depression using a difference-in-differences design. They find that adolescents with recent probable depression experienced a drop of 0.14 points in grade point average after the 2004 warning relative to those without probable depression. They also find increases in substance use and delinquency. Consistent with our findings, the indirect behavioral responses estimated by Busch et al. (2014) are driven entirely by girls.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 details the history of the FDA's black box warnings on antidepressants. In Section 3, we describe the data and our empirical strategy. Section 4 contains our estimates of the impact of the 2007 expanded black box warning on employment, as well as robustness checks. In Section 5, we explore mechanisms through which the warning may have altered employment. Finally, in Section 6, we discuss the implications of our findings.",Employment effects of healthcare policy: Evidence from the 2007 FDA black box warning on antidepressants,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016762962030076X,9 June 2020,2020,Research Article,216.0

One of the most widespread and contentious strategy has been the introduction of patient cost-sharing, which is intended to increase patient costs, to induce more price sensitivity, and to potentially reduce moral hazard and system costs. In particular, many high-income countries have increased cost-sharing in health services in general, with the most substantial increases for prescription drugs – as observed in the UK, Germany, Japan, France, and the US (Zare and Anderson, 2013). However, while lower subsidies and greater out-of-pocket spending within cost-sharing schemes could help reduce the scope for moral hazard, it is also possible that patients could reduce necessary medications because of out-of-pocket costs. This is of particular concern for those facing immediate life-threatening risks as well as for low-income patients, who may be more responsive to out-of-pocket spending as they face liquidity constraints. If this is the case, higher patient costs may lead to worse health outcomes and to offsetting effects through increased use of downstream health services, disability and mortality. The optimal design of health systems therefore depends not only on whether strategies to contain direct costs are effective in achieving this goal, but also on the balance between subsidies ==== out-of-pocket spending within systems, and its ultimate consequences on health outcomes and equity.====In this paper we evaluate the health effects of a large-scale subsidizing program of prescription drugs introduced in Brazil. In 2006 the federal government launched the ==== program (ATFP), a copayment system in partnership with private retail pharmacies.==== In the ATFP system, the government establishes a reference price for the generic version of each listed medicine. Patients pay for the difference between the retail price and 90% of the reference price – generally resulting in substantially lower prices for the patient at the pharmacy counter. The program expanded fast. A decade later, it had already reached approximately half the total number of private retail pharmacies in Brazil, and nearly 20 million users.====More specifically, this paper evaluates the effects of ATFP on mortality and hospitalization by diabetes for individuals aged 40 years or more. We focus on diabetes for two main reasons. First, diabetes is considered a major global health threat (Zimmet et al., 2016, UN, 2007). Around 1 in 11 adults has diabetes in the world today (0.43 billion individuals), while 12% of global health expenditures are spent on the disease (IDF, 2017). Productivity losses and the financial burden of diabetes tend to escalate as the poor management of the disease can lead to serious complications in the long run, such as vision loss, kidney and heart failure, nerve problems, and amputations. Second, the needs for prescription drugs are different for distinct types of diabetes. ATFP provides a range of antidiabetic drugs, including insulin and oral hypoglycemics (metformin and glibenclamide). Daily use of insulin is vital for Type I patients, for whom cessation of use leads to death in a matter of weeks.==== For Type II patients, the need for insulin is variable, not necessarily urgent, and depends on clinical conditions. The management of Type II diabetes often includes changes in lifestyle and the use of oral hypoglycemics, such as metformin. Although severe hyperglycemia is a cause of hospital admissions, life-threatening diabetic ketoacidosis is much less common for Type II patients. By looking at Type I ==== Type II outcomes, we are therefore able to examine whether high- ====. low-risk patients respond differently to variation in cost-sharing schemes.====Our empirical strategy is based on a municipality-by-year fixed effects model, and exploits two idiosyncratic features of the Brazilian context to associate variation in subsidized access to medicines, through the expansion of pharmacies accredited to ATFP across time and space, with variation in health outcomes. The first feature relates to the design of the Brazilian health system, in which both the public and the private sectors provide health services. The Unified Health System (SUS, for ====) is committed to provide free, universal, integral, and equal health coverage; while the private sector provides services either funded by out-of-pocket spending or regulated private insurance.==== Further, access to medicines within the public sector is largely constrained by rationing of pharmaceutical services, as availability in stock is often limited and intermittent, while private health insurance rarely covers prescription drugs. For most Brazilians, prescription drugs have been thus obtained through out-of-pocket payments at private pharmacies. In this situation, the ATFP roll-out corresponds to an expansion in subsidized access to prescription drugs, net of simultaneous changes in access to other health services as well as in other cost-sharing mechanisms aimed at controlling pharmacy use.====Second, we draw on institutional constraints required for pharmacy accreditation in the system to gain exogenous variation in the sequential process of expansion of ATFP pharmacies across municipalities. Although any private pharmacy is eligible to the program, in practice many fail to meet the official requirements needed even for their operation in the retail market. In particular, many pharmacies are unable to hire and retain a pharmacist on their payroll. While the lack of pharmacists has not represented a ==== constraint to pharmacies’ operation, accreditation in ATFP strictly requires the pharmacy to continuously prove compliance with this requirement. A limited supply of pharmacists in the local labor market at the time of program introduction is then expected to constrain its expansion throughout the following years. We explore this feature in a IV approach, in which the instrumental variable is defined by the interaction between the supply of pharmacists across municipalities in the baseline year and a linear time trend. Thus, conditional on municipality and time fixed-effects, we expect the process of ATFP diffusion to be relatively slower in localities where the baseline supply of pharmacists was more limited. A series of falsification tests supports the validity of this identification strategy.====We use unique administrative records to build a yearly panel of municipality-level data. The Brazilian Ministry of Health (Datasus) provides individual-level data on the universe of all deaths in Brazil, and all hospital admissions through SUS. These data include main diagnosis, patients’ municipality of residence and demographic characteristics, which are used to construct age-specific diabetes mortality and hospitalization rates, by diabetes type. In the specific case of hospital admissions, we observe patients’ zip code of residence and hospitalization costs, which enables us to further examine heterogeneity by socioeconomic status and to estimate averted spending in terms of hospital admissions. The Brazilian Ministry of Health also provides data on the number of retail pharmacies accredited to the program in each municipality and year. In order to examine local labor market dynamics, we complement our data with information on the total number of private retail pharmacies as well as on the number and wages of pharmacists and other pharmacy workers from the ==== (RAIS), an administrative microdata set from the Ministry of Labor that contains the universe of formal workers and firms in Brazil.====We find weak evidence for a decline in mortality, but a robust reduction in hospitalization rates. According to our preferred IV specification, an additional ATFP pharmacy per 100,000 inhabitants is associated with a decrease in hospitalization rates by diabetes of 8.2, which corresponds to 3.6% of its baseline rate of 226 admissions per 100,000. Effects are larger for Type II diabetes in comparison to Type I, and among patients with relatively lower socioeconomic status. In particular, we observe that ATFP effects on the reduction of hospitalization by Type II diabetes are 33% greater in comparison to Type I when adjusted by the average hospitalization rate for each group. These results are consistent with insulin-dependent patients being relatively less responsive to subsidies because of higher immediate life-threatening risks, and with lower-SES individuals being more responsive because of liquidity constraints. More generally, the results suggest that high-risk patients are less responsive to variations in subsidies or out-of-pocket spending within cost-sharing schemes as they face greater likelihood of experiencing adverse health outcomes because of non-adherence to treatment. Based on secondary data, we also observe that ATFP is associated with increased adherence to medication in general and, importantly, among those under poor management of the condition in particular. Counterfactual simulations indicate that ATFP averted approximately 242 thousand hospital admissions by diabetes during the period of analysis. This represents 16.7% of the total number of hospital admissions, and 12.7% of the hospitalization costs funded by SUS, considering counterfactual trends had the program been not implemented.====The existing literature has largely focused on the effects of variations in cost-sharing on health spending, while causal evidence on its effects on health outcomes has been sparse and mixed. Further, evidence has been overwhelmingly raised from US studies, which often explore specific contexts of multiple-payer managed care, and where variation in prescription drug cost-sharing is often bundled with variation in cost-sharing in other health services. For instance, Chandra et al. (2010) find that, among the elderly Medicare population in California, an increase in patient cost-sharing in both physician visits and prescription drugs decreased service utilization, but led to substantial offsetting effects in terms of increased hospitalization. On the other hand, the same authors find that, among low-income enrollees in the Massachusetts’ Commonwealth Care program, an increase in cost-sharing reduced services utilization, but did not have any offset effects (Chandra et al., 2014).====We also observe mixed results in the few and specific contexts in which exogenous variation in either cost-sharing or health insurance coverage applied solely to prescription drugs. For instance, Gaynor et al. (2007) find that an increase in prescription drug cost-sharing, among the non-elderly enrolled in employer-provided health insurance, reduced pharmacy use, increased outpatient care spending, but did not affect hospitalization. Kaestner et al. (2019) find that obtaining prescription drug insurance through Medicare Part D was associated with a reduction in hospitalization, but not with a decline in mortality rates. Huh and Reif (2017) and Dunn and Shapiro (2019), on the other hand, employ different empirical strategies and find that the Medicare Part D roll-out was significantly associated with a decline in mortality rates among the eligible elderly. Puig-Junoy et al. (2016) find that an exemption from pharmaceutical copayment granted to retired individuals in Spain increased the consumption of prescription drugs, but did not have any offset effects in terms of reduced hospitalization. Consistent with that, evaluations of value-based insurance design schemes suggest positive but modest effects on medication adherence, and have not supported any clear consensus about impacts on overall spending and on clinical outcomes (Farley, 2019, Agarwal et al., 2018, Tang et al., 2014, Lee et al., 2013).====Overall, notwithstanding the efforts from previous studies, the understanding of the extent to which patient cost-sharing affects health outcomes remains unsettled. This may reflect the fact that the existing evidence comes from context-specific settings in developed countries, where variation in subsidies or out-of-pocket spending within cost-sharing schemes often applies to multiple health services at once, and where health care coverage is nearly universal. The consequences of variations in subsidies or out-of-pocket costs should depend on whether individuals are able to respond to prices so as to minimize adverse health outcomes. If this is the case, we should expect little variation, possibly coupled with mixed results, in health outcomes in contexts where liquidity constraints are relatively less binding and where individuals are often covered by, and could respond differently to distinct insurance schemes. This is consistent, for instance, with the lack of consensus regarding clinical benefits from value-based insurance design schemes. This is also consistent with Kaestner and Khan (2012), which shows that prior to Medicare Part D, the elderly without prescription drug insurance filled nearly as many prescriptions per year as elderly with prescription drug insurance.====This paper advances the existing literature by providing new evidence from a nationwide intervention within a unique empirical setting, in which variation in subsidies to prescription drugs comes net of simultaneous changes in access to other health services as well as in other cost-sharing mechanisms, where access to pharmaceuticals are mostly made through out-of-pocket expenses, and where liquidity constraints are relatively binding for most individuals. Causal evidence from developing countries is particularly mute and, differently from prior studies, mostly based on specific settings in the US, we thus provide evidence from a context where individuals are more vulnerable and substantially less insured on pharmaceutical services. By looking at outcomes for different types of diabetes, we are also able to examine whether patients facing distinct health risks respond differently to variation in subsidies within cost-sharing schemes. In that sense, our results are particularly informative to many countries across the world that are developing or revising health financing policies in an effort to improve health system performance, enhance access to essential medicines, and progress towards universal health coverage.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the institutional setting. Section 3 presents the data, while section 4 describes our empirical strategy. Section 5 presents the main results and robustness checks. In Section 6 we assess equity by examining whether ATFP utilization and its effects on health outcomes vary with socioeconomic status and by health condition. In Section 7 we explore secondary data to investigate heterogeneity by adherence to treatment and to discuss whether ATFP has helped improve the management of the condition. In Section 8 we present estimates on averted costs, and further discuss the implications of our results.

Our research generalizes earlier models in several ways. We introduce risk ","For decades, economists have studied how consumers trade off mortality risk and money (Murphy and Topel, 2006; Rosen, 1988). These analyses guide policymakers in addressing incomplete markets for life-extension investments, e.g., by determining optimal investments in safer transportation infrastructure or optimal environmental standards. In the healthcare context, economic theories of mortality risk-reduction help determine how much third-party payers and social planners should spend on extending life. However, they do not determine how to allocate resources among competing interventions. The related theory of cost-effectiveness, of roughly the same vintage as the theory of mortality risk-reduction, addresses these gaps (Weinstein and Stason, 1977).====Cost-effectiveness has long been used in Britain, Canada, and Australia to determine coverage and reimbursement of new medical technologies by health insurers and to evaluate medical technologies in the US and elsewhere. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), a US nonprofit organization, routinely conducts and releases cost-effectiveness studies for use by American healthcare payers and providers.==== Nearly 60% of US payers have consulted cost-effectiveness analyses in their price negotiations or reimbursement decisions (Lising et al., 2016).

In May 2017, the Social Insurance Institution of Finland sent a personal information letter to all physicians who had issued a prescription containing at least 100 tablets of paracetamol-codeine combination to a new ","Opioid addiction and opioid related deaths are vast and growing public health problems especially in the United States. In 2016, 1.5 percent of all deaths in the U.S. were attributable to opioids, and 20 percent of deaths among adults aged 24–35 involved opioids (Gomes et al., 2018). A recent study by Powell et al. (2020) suggests that an increase in the supply of medical opioids has been a significant driver of opioid overdose deaths.====The use of prescription opioids and opioid-related mortality is also growing in Western Europe, but the levels are considerably lower than in the U.S. (van Amsterdam and van den Brink, 2015; Fischer et al., 2014). In Europe, the growth in opioid consumption has been even more rapid than in the U.S. in recent years. However, on average, the levels are still considerably lower in the EU countries. There are also significant differences in opioid consumption and associated problems between European countries. In some Eastern and Southern European countries, the problem lies more in the insufficient treatment of pain. In Western and Northern European countries, the levels of use and the risks arising from the overuse of opioids are higher (for a more detailed discussion of the situation in Europe see e.g. Bosetti et al., 2019 or Statistical Bulletin, 2019).====In Finland, 395,251 persons purchased reimbursable prescription opioids in 2017. Most of the prescription opioid purchases are mild opioids, paracetamol-codeine combination being the most popular (Nevantaus et al., 2013). Paracetamol-codeine combinations are commonly used in the treatment of both acute and chronic pain. 256,737 persons, which represents around 4.7 percent of the Finnish population, purchased paracetamol-codeine combinations in 2017. There has been an increasing trend in opioid abuse also in Finland (Häkkinen, 2015). It is estimated that in 2017 there were 23,500–29,500 opioid problem users in Finland. That is 0.68–0.86 percent of the population. The problem users were defined as people who had an official record of opioid use that had caused some social or health related problem (Rönkä et al., 2020; Selin et al., 2015). Fatal poisonings by prescription opioids accounted for a third of all drug poisonings in 2008 (Häkkinen et al., 2012).====An appealing course of action to reduce the harms is to influence the dose, duration and formulation of the prescriptions (Samet and Kertesz, 2018). The size and duration of the first prescription has been shown to be a significant predictor of continuing opioid use (Barnett et al., 2017; Shah et al., 2017). Therefore, reducing the size of the first purchase can be one effective way to mitigate the adverse effects related to opioid prescribing. One means to influence prescribing is to provide education about proper clinical guidelines.====The aim of our study is to analyze the effects of a personal information letter on physicians’ opioid prescribing patterns. The letter was sent by the Social Insurance Institution of Finland (Kela) in May 2017 to 4549 physicians who had prescribed a package containing at least 100 tablets of paracetamol-codeine to a new patient in 2016. The aim of the letter was to draw physicians’ attention to their prescribing practices and decrease the package size of the first paracetamol-codeine prescription. The letter gave general information about pain relief with paracetamol-codeine and suggested that treatment be started with a package containing only 10–30 tablets, because of the high risks associated with long-term use of the drug. Two key questions we seek to answer are: First, what effect did the information letter have on paracetamol-codeine purchases among new patients? Second, what was the impact on the probability of a new patient purchasing at least 100 tablets?====We add to recent literature by Doctor et al. (2018) and Sacarny et al. (2016), which studies the effects of large-scale information campaigns on opioid prescribing. A strength of our setting is the universal coverage of health care in Finland. This enables us to identify effects that are not confounded by the availability of health insurance. Additionally, to our knowledge, we are the first to study a nationwide prescribing information campaign in Europe.==== The letter was only sent to physicians who had issued a large prescription to a new patient. This yields a quasi-experimental setting, which enables a reliable analysis of the impact of the letter on the physicians’ prescribing behavior. We use a difference-in-differences research design, in which the treatment group consists of new patients whose physician received the letter, while the control group consists of new patients whose physician did not receive the letter. The number of physicians who received the letter represents roughly 17 percent of all physicians who prescribed any reimbursed drugs in Finland in 2018. We use comprehensive register data on all reimbursed paracetamol-codeine, tramadol (mild opioid) and oxycodone (strong opioid) purchases with a 12-month follow-up period to analyze the effects of the letter on new patients’ paracetamol-codeine purchases as well as on tramadol and oxycodone purchases. Furthermore, we conduct subsample analyses based on physicians’ previous prescribing frequency, specialty and place of residence to study the heterogeneous effects of the letter.====There is growing empirical evidence suggesting that influencing physicians’ prescribing patterns can have a key role in tackling the opioid epidemic. Schnell and Currie (2018) show that opioid prescribing depends on physicians’ initial education in pain management, and training aimed at the most liberal prescribers could be a successful policy tool. Studies have also shown that mandatory prescription drug monitoring programs, which record the patient’s prescribing history, have decreased opioid and other prescription drug abuse (Buchmueller and Carey, 2017; Dave et al., 2017).====Our study relates to the literature studying the effects of information letters on physician prescribing behavior (e.g. Ho and Venci, 2012; Sacarny et al., 2016, 2018). In this literature, evidence is somewhat mixed. Ho and Venci (2012) reviewed 39 interventions of which 26 found an impact on at least some of the studied outcomes. Their review also stated that letters targeting one specific drug were more successful than those with a wider range of targets. The letter under evaluation in this paper also targeted one specific drug and had an expert article as an attachment. More recently, informational letter campaigns have been used to tackle the current opioid crisis. Doctor et al. (2018) analyzed the effect of a personal letter from the medical examiner to physicians whose patient had died from an overdose of a controlled substance. Their findings show that the letter decreased opioid prescribing and its recipients were less likely to start a new patient on opioids. However, Sacarny et al. (2016) found no effects when a peer comparison letter was sent to physicians who were identified as potential over-prescribers of controlled substances, which include opioid pain relievers. The letter under evaluation in this study also, although implicitly, informed physicians that they were prescribing more than their peers. Sacarny et al. (2018) found that physicians, who were informed by letter that their prescribing of antipsychotics were under review and their prescribing was compared to their peers’, decreased their prescribing of quetiapine 11 percent relative to the comparison group. This is in line with our estimate that the information letter decreased the number of tablets prescribed to new patients by roughly 12.5 percent compared to the pre-letter mean. Doctor et al. (2018) found effects of the same magnitude in their study.====Furthermore, effects of informational letters have been studied, for example, in the context of tax collection (Hallsworth et al., 2017) and energy conservation (Allcott and Rogers, 2014), in which social norms have been shown to have a significant impact on behavior.====In more general terms, there is evidence of overuse in several categories of medical services. These include, for example, overprescribing addictive substances and the overuse of screening and diagnostic tests and end-of-life care. These practices can lead to adverse health effects and unnecessary health care costs. It has been suggested that one of the drivers of overuse, in addition to economic incentives, is inaccurate information about treatment practices. Thus, providing physicians feedback and information on clinical guidelines can be an effective policy tool to reduce the overuse of medical services. (Sacarny et al., 2016; Brownlee et al., 2017; Saini et al., 2017).====A personal information letter may influence physicians’ prescribing behavior through several potential mechanisms. First, the letter and its guidelines may have educated physicians about the use of paracetamol-codeine combination in pain treatment especially on new patients. As Sacarny et al. (2016) describe, informative letters could present a form of continuing medical education. Information letters can provide information on proper prescribing practices to physicians relatively cheaply compared to, for example, reading scientific literature or attending seminars. The costs of acquiring information can be associated with the use of certain information in physicians’ decision making (Phelps, 2000; Phelps and Mooney, 1993). Second, the information acquired from the letter is probably more “available” to the physicians right after they receive it than older information, on which their previous prescribing was based. Availability is a well-known concept in psychology and behavioral economics (see e.g. Tversky and Kahneman, 1973). Third, the letter may serve as a signal that prescribing patterns are monitored. The possibility of monitoring can lead to a decrease in overall prescribing (Sacarny et al., 2018; Buchmueller and Carey, 2017; Dave et al., 2017). Fourth, the information letter implicitly reminds the physicians that they have been prescribing more paracetamol-codeine than most of their peers. This may signal that the physicians are violating a social or a professional norm.==== Adhering to the professional norm enables that, in the case of an adverse treatment outcome, physicians can refer to the norms they are following. Therefore, complying with professional norms can lower the “responsibility costs” of the physician (Frank, 2004).",Impact of a physician-targeted letter on opioid prescribing,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629619307891,2 June 2020,2020,Research Article,219.0

It has long been recognized that social capital plays an important role in economic affairs. A recent search on Web of Science identified over 1000 studies in economics journals in which social capital appears in the title. Research on social capital has been published in the ==== (Guiso et al., 2004; Karlan, 2005), the ==== (Knack and Keefer, 1997; Glaeser et al., 2000), the ==== (Bowles and Gintis, 2002; Glaeser et al., 2002; Durlauf, 2002; Helliwell, 2006), and other top economics journals. The topic continues to be of interest to economists (McCoy et al., 2019; Hoi et al., 2019; de Vaan et al., 2019d; Andini and Andini, 2018; and Wang, 2019).====However, most of the economic research on social capital has focused on areas such as economic growth (Knack and Keefer, 1997; Algan and Cahuc, 2010), financial development (Guiso et al., 2004), political governance (Putnam, 1993; Nannicini et al., 2013) and formation of large firms and organizations (La Porta et al., 1997). While some economic research has focused on health, the literature is relatively small. This is surprising, not only because social capital has been found to be an important determinant of economic outcomes in other areas, but also because there is a voluminous literature on social capital and health outside of economics, particularly in public health, medicine, epidemiology, gerontology and other health-related disciplines.====This study uses meta-analysis to aggregate empirical findings in the literature on social capital and health.==== Our goal is to assess the overall economic impact of social capital on health and determine whether it is “large” or “small”. Given the broad scope of both “social capital” and “health”, we also want to dig deeper into the overall relationship to explore whether certain types of social capital are particularly impactful for certain types of health outcomes.====Our primary motivation is to determine whether this is a subject that should attract more attention from economists. If studies from other disciplines, and the extant economics literature on this topic, have found that social capital is an important determinant of health, then the dearth of economic research in this area represents a gap that should be addressed. On the other hand, if the conclusion from existing studies is that social capital is not an important determinant of health, then this justifies the relative lack of attention this subject has received in the economics discipline. Further, it would call into question recent initiatives to promote health through social capital by the WHO, the OECD, and US Healthy People 2020 (Rocco and Suhrcke, 2012; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010; Keeley, 2007).====This study proceeds as follows. Section 2 reviews the economics literature on social capital. Section 3 explains our use of meta-analysis and our strategy for combining diverse estimates from different studies. Section 4 presents and discusses the data that we use in our analysis. Section 5 presents initial estimates of the “overall” effect of social capital on health, along with the results of a commonly used test for publication bias. Section 6 uses meta-regression to identify the factors that affect the size of the estimated effects of social capital on health. It also takes a closer look at finer categories of social capital and health to see if there are some kinds of social capital that may affect some kinds of health outcomes, even if the overall effect is small.

In pharmaceutical markets, a common brand name can link firms’ reputation across different therapeutic markets and across different product types such as prescription and non-prescription [or over-the-counter (OTC)] drugs. This paper investigates how the exposure of consumers to non-prescription drug advertising effects their probability of buying prescription drugs of the advertising firm. In the pharmaceutical industry, firm names are often prominently displayed on drug packages although products are from unrelated categories. While many pharmaceutical firms, such as ==== or ==== sell a portfolio of prescription and non-prescription drugs, some generic firms create product names using their firm names.==== In the sample of pharmaceutical products used in this study (data explained later), the firm name is part of the product name for 42 percent of the drug packages (81 percent of generic drug packages).====To identify the effect of umbrella branding on prescription drug sales, I exploit a market regulation in Germany that prohibits consumer-directed advertising for prescription drugs but allows it for non-prescription drugs. Advertising of OTC drugs is seasonal and correlates with the prevalence of colds and the flu, two common therapeutic categories in the OTC drugs market, and peaks each November (compare Fig. 1). I use the exogenous variation in seasonality as instrumental variable for advertising spillovers in markets for prescription drugs treating chronic diseases (diabetes, epilepsy, and Alzheimer's disease) which prevalence (occurrence) is even across the year. The variable season is interacted with the portfolio of OTC drugs to capture each firms’ potential exposure to advertising peaks. Estimates from a reduced-form sales equation find positive spillover effects of firms’ OTC drug advertising on prescription drug sales of the same firm. A common firm or brand name that links products in the minds of consumers increase awareness and is, for example, associated with more credible quality signals (Clark et al., 2009, Choi, 1998, Nelson, 1974, Bagwell, 2007).====A structural model complements the empirical analysis and quantifies the economic effects of umbrella branding on consumer and producer surplus. The demand model allows advertising spillovers from the non-prescription drug market on consumer utility (Berry et al., 1995). On the supply side, I assume Bertrand–Nash pricing of multi-product firms and solve for optimal prices and quantities in a counter-factual equilibrium without umbrella branding. Using data from the therapeutic market for anti-epileptic drugs (AED) in Germany, I estimate that consumers value OTC drug advertising positively. My simulation shows that umbrella branding expands the market for anti-epileptic drugs by about 13 percent on average, from both more adherent and new patients (while patients still substitute between products). In particular, generic manufacturers expand their sales more than originators and importers.==== Further, prices and advertising are complements, i.e., umbrella branding is associated with higher prices. In relative terms, prices of generics increase more than of originators, a finding that can be explained by low-margin generics that need to cover advertising expenditures and by the increasing market power from advertising.====My paper quantifies consumer surplus which increases in a market with advertising spillovers mostly due to more treated epilepsy patients. Consumers value advertising spillovers as a product attribute and choose to consume the products more often, either through stricter adherence or new take-ups. Since prices increase moderately, the simulation finds increasing consumer surplus with umbrella branding. From a health policy perspective, the benefits of more treated consumers are weighted with more expenses of the public health insurance. The overall effects of advertising spillovers on social welfare, however, depend on market characteristics and are difficult to quantify. If patients of under-treated diseases, such as epilepsy, receive more medication, advertising spillovers would have a positive effect. In contrast, market expansion through advertising can be harmful for over-prescribed molecules, such as opioids (Alpert et al., 2018).====The paper also provides strategic implications for marketing managers: it shows that both originators and generic firms can effectively advertise towards consumers via non-prescription drugs. Pharmaceutical firms benefit from spillovers of their brand name across product categories from an increase in overall revenues due to more sales and higher prices. However, the spillovers might makes it more difficult to manage advertising budgets precisely across a portfolio of products and categories. Umbrella branding poses also challenges to regulators if firms bypass advertising restrictions by linking reputation across regulated and unregulated markets. Particularly, advertising spillovers can threaten the health status of consumers if, for example, umbrella branding leads to misguided drug choices (FDA, 2014, ISMP, 2007).====Several authors show the effectiveness of advertising on prescription drug demand (Lakdawalla et al., 2013, Avery et al., 2012, Ching et al., 2016, Iizuka, 2004) and on OTC drug demand (Ling et al., 2003, Akçura et al., 2004). Regarding advertising spillovers, Ling et al. (2003) find positive spillover effects of prescription drug marketing before a drug switches status from prescription to non-prescription (Rx-to-OTC switch). My work investigates the reverse spillover from OTC advertising on prescription drug demand using data from a non-US market without Rx-to-OTC switches. Shapiro (2018) finds spillovers of advertising towards doctors (detailing) on the number of off-label prescriptions, i.e., prescriptions for a medical treatment not approved by the FDA. Sinkinson and Starc (2018) find evidence for advertising spillovers on the category level, i.e. on demand for non-advertised pharmaceuticals. Lakdawalla et al. (2013) find that the introduction of Medicare Part D, the US federal drug insurance program for the elderly, increases advertising expenditures which affects drug demand outside the Medicare program. Alpert et al. (2015) show that the advertising spillover from the introduction of Medicare Part D leads to an increased take-up and improved adherence.

This constant is derived by dividing value per statistical life (VSL) estimates by expected future QALYs. We explore the theoretical validity of this practice by studying the properties of WTP for improved health and longevity in a framework that makes minimal assumptions about the shape of an agent's utility function. We find that dividing VSL by expected QALYs results in an upper bound on the WTP for a marginal improvement in the ====, as measured by gains in health status or longevity. Calibration results suggest that analysts using this approach to monetize health benefits overestimate the value of a program or policy by a factor of two on average. We also derive a lower bound on the WTP for improved health and longevity that permits a novel empirical test for the descriptive validity of the QALY model. Our calibrations suggest that this lower bound is on average 20% smaller than the actual WTP.","Government agencies around the world employ estimates of the value per statistical life (VSL) or the value per statistical life year (VSLY) to quantify the benefits of regulation-induced changes in mortality risk. Monetizing health risks in this manner has the advantage that the benefits and costs of policy interventions become directly comparable. However, this approach ignores non-fatal risks (e.g., chronic bronchitis due to air pollution, temporary or permanent disability due to workplace accidents, non-fatal bladder cancer from contaminated drinking water); the benefits of reducing the probability or severity of these harms are often substantial (Cameron, 2014). The development of a catalog of monetary values for reducing the risk of various non-fatal health effects through primary valuation studies would be desirable. However, because the number of health states, health profiles (time paths through health states), and other attributes associated with health (e.g. productivity loss, treatment costs) are potentially limitless, this is a daunting task.====The difficulty of estimating monetary values for both acute and chronic illnesses is mirrored in the small number of studies that estimate willingness-to-pay (WTP) values for reductions in morbidity risks. Instead, analysts have turned to surrogate methods for monetizing morbidity endpoints. Perhaps the most common practice is to approximate the monetary value of improved health by combining preference-based measures of the severity and duration of illness—often expressed in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)—with monetary estimates of the value of reducing mortality risk (e.g., Hammitt, 2002, Kenkel, 2006).==== Operationally, the method consists of dividing the VSL by expected future QALYs conditional on surviving the current period (Hirth et al., 2000). We will refer to this method as the value per QALY approach.====In this paper, we explore the theoretical validity of this practice by studying the properties of WTP for improved health and extended longevity within a framework that relies on minimal assumptions about an agent's lifetime utility function and the interactions between her wealth, health, and longevity prospects. We assume that preferences for health and longevity can be summarized using a scalar-valued index of quality of life, and that utility is separable between this index and wealth (which limits consumption). QALYs are one example of such an index. However, we emphasize that our results are more general and extend to other life-year measures of health and longevity including disability adjusted life years (DALYs), healthy-years equivalent, and life years (Murray, 1994, Mehrez and Gafni, 1989).====The first part of the paper demonstrates that the value per QALY approach yields an upper bound on the WTP for a marginal improvement in the quality of life (in the form of gains in health, longevity, or both). Therefore, analysts applying this approach to approximate monetary benefits of quality of life improvements generally overestimate the value of the program or policy assessed. We also identify a lower bound on the WTP for a marginal improvement in the quality of life that is proportional to the monetized average utility gain of a change from current to perfect quality of life. This lower bound equals the WTP for a marginal improvement when health and longevity approach their maximum values. Applying the lower bound to approximate monetary benefits of quality of life improvements underestimates the value of the impact of the program or policy. In studies evaluating the benefits of interventions to improve health or longevity, the upper and lower bounds may prove useful for sensitivity analysis.====Provided that preferences over lotteries on health and longevity are independent of wealth—an assumption implicit in the definition of the QALY (Hammitt, 2013)—the WTP per QALY coincides with its upper and lower bounds and may be obtained by dividing VSL by quality-adjusted life expectancy. However, even under this independence condition, the marginal WTP per QALY (or any other life-year measure) decreases with better health prospects and hence depends on baseline health and the prospective health gain. The intuition for this result is simple. Individuals with higher baseline quality of life derive less utility from a quality of life improvement ==== face a higher opportunity cost of spending resources. Bleichrodt and Quiggin (1999) obtained this result for the standard QALY model in which utility is additively separable across time periods. We extend their work using a more general health utility model that allows for complementarity between time periods. In turn, this allows us to provide a new empirical test for the descriptive validity of the QALY metric, which requires that the upper and lower bounds on the WTP for improved health are equal.====In the second part of the paper, we impose additional structure to calibrate the spread of the theoretically derived bounds. We assume that the lifetime utility an individual derives from quality of life and wealth displays constant relative risk aversion (CRRA). This implies that individuals with higher baseline levels of quality of life (wealth) derive less utility from an increase in quality of life (wealth). In our calibration, we allow the degree of risk aversion to differ between the two dimensions. We borrow estimates of risk aversion with respect to wealth from Chetty (2006). To calibrate risk aversion with respect to quality of life, we employ three approaches. The first is based on estimates from studies that directly elicit the coefficient of risk aversion with respect to longevity or quality of life from survey data; the second estimates the curvature of visual analog/rating scale estimates compared with standard gamble estimates of health; the third derives the quality-of-life related parameter of risk aversion from estimates of WTP per QALY. The calibrated CRRA utility functions confirm our theoretical findings and help us gauge the magnitudes of the effects. The ratios of the upper and lower bounds to WTP are sensitive to quality of life and differ across alternative calibrations. When averaging across our calibrations and all levels of quality of life, we find that the upper bound overestimates the WTP by a factor of two while the lower bound underestimates it by 20%.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the literature related to the valuation of improved health.

The welfare economics of insurance has traditionally focused on the trade-off between this consumption smoothing benefit and the costs of moral hazard, and this trade-off has been extensively studied in the health insurance literature (Pauly, 1968, Feldstein, 1973, Friedman, 1974, Feldman and Dowd, 1991; Manning and Marquis, 1989; Manning and Marquis, 1996, Newhouse, 1993, Einav et al., 2013).====But relatively unique among insurance products, health insurance provides a second benefit to consumers: the ability to pre-pay for a package of medical services, some of which would be unaffordable in the absence of insurance. That is, health insurance provides access to health care by helping to eliminate liquidity constraints for the purchase of expensive procedures and treatments. Nyman, 1999, Nyman, 2003 provided the first economic analysis of this access benefit. This access benefit of health insurance has not been lost on policymakers—and arguably served as a motivation for recent large expansions of social and private health insurance programs. For example, both the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the creation of Medicare Part D (which expanded coverage for pharmaceutical products for Medicare beneficiaries), were supported, in part, because they would allow patients to access treatments and services that they otherwise would have been unable to afford. In fact, much of the most recent debate about the future of the ACA's ban on insurers considering the existence of pre-existing conditions or the practice of medically underwriting policies has focused on the access benefits of insurance rather than the more traditional consumption smoothing benefits.====Given the increasing policy importance of the access motive of health insurance, this paper presents a theoretical analysis of the economics of a health insurance market in which this relatively unique feature of health insurance is front and center. To highlight the distinctive role of the access motive in shaping market outcomes we deliberately abstract away from both the consumption smoothing benefit of insurance and the moral hazard from an individual over-utilizing medical services. At first blush, one might imagine that the insights of a theoretical model featuring the access motive would be straightforward: the ability to obtain health insurance would eliminate liquidity constraints and increase consumer surplus for individuals who would be unable to afford expensive health care without it. This, in fact, is the conclusion reached by Nyman (1999) who estimated that in the U.S. in the late 1980s the access benefit of health insurance was about three times as large as the consumption smoothing benefit.====In this paper we show that the access motive for health insurance may not increase consumer surplus—and may even decrease it—if sellers of medical services exercise market power in setting prices. We study a setting in which liquidity constrained individuals have the opportunity to purchase health insurance in a perfectly competitive market. In the baseline version of the model, the insurance plan covers a share of the cost of a specialized treatment sold by a monopolist (e.g., a new pharmaceutical treatment for cancer). To abstract from the consumption smoothing motive, consumers are assumed to be risk neutral. To abstract from moral hazard based on an individual's overconsumption of medical services, consumers are assumed to purchase at most a single unit of the treatment, and the value of the treatment for any consumer is assumed to exceed the treatment's incremental cost.====If the price of the covered was exogenous, as in the Nyman, 1999, Nyman, 2003 model, access to health insurance would increase aggregate consumer surplus. But when we allow for endogenous pricing of the treatment by a monopoly innovator, we show that the monopolist's profit-maximizing price for an insured treatment is greater (for any level of cost sharing in the insurance contract) than it would be if consumers did not have access to insurance. The impact of monopoly pricing could be so strong that consumer surplus might be lower when consumers are not insured than when they have full insurance. Thus, the market power of providers can potentially enable them to convert the entirety of the access benefit of insurance into producer profit.====The prediction that insurance coverage can raise health care prices would seem to be no different than the one that arises in a traditional model of insurance with moral hazard. In fact the mechanism underlying our results is very different from that in a standard moral hazard model. In such a model, insurance reduces the out-of-pocket amount paid by consumers for covered medical services, leading providers who possess market power to raise prices. Importantly, this mechanism for a price increase can be countered through increased cost sharing, i.e., in the standard model a provider's profit-maximizing price goes down as cost sharing goes up. By contrast in our model, we show that there can exist a range over which increased cost sharing can lead the monopolist to ==== prices—a result that is important for welfare considerations and does not arise from a standard moral hazard model. The key difference is that in a standard moral hazard model, greater cost sharing induces a ====, i.e., with greater cost sharing, consumers face a higher out-of-pocket price, inducing them, on the margin, to substitute away from the insured service. In our model, by contrast, cost sharing entirely works through an ====. Cost sharing deters low-income individuals from purchasing insurance, in part because they may not be able to afford the cost share, thus decreasing the value of the insurance product. This raises the average income of those who purchase insurance, which may encourage the monopolist to raise its price, even though these individuals are paying a higher portion of the price themselves. We note that increased cost sharing leading to a decline in insurance purchases is not an abstract concern or construct of our model. During the 2017 debate about “repeal and replace” of the ACA, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that lower income consumers would not purchase high deductible insurance because cost sharing decreased the value of insurance.==== Similarly, recent work by Geruso et al. (2017) suggests that some insurers attempt to use formulary construction and cost sharing for expensive pharmaceuticals to make their policies unattractive to particularly expensive enrollees.====We then extend our model to a situation in which insurers are required to cover not just the monopoly-provided service but also a set of core medical goods and services sold at competitive prices (e.g. hospital and physician services as well as generic medications).==== Thus, unlike our baseline model which implicitly assumed that consumers can purchase coverage ====, in this extension consumers face the choice between an insurance plan that covers a fixed bundle of services or going without coverage. This extension more closely approximates the structure of the health insurance market in the United States. Consistent with the results in our basic model, full insurance results in a higher price for the monopoly service and lower consumer surplus than would arise if the insurance plan did not cover the monopoly service. We also show that the monopolist will charge more than its product is worth to consumers. Our model demonstrates that when insurers are compelled to cover both competitive and monopolized services in a single bundle, a monopoly seller may set a price that captures some of the value created in the competitive markets for other health services, value that was previously captured by consumers. The monopolist stops raising price only when it reaches the point that insurance becomes unaffordable to so many consumers that sales of their product start to fall. Though our model is too stylized to offer precise numerical predictions, an example that broadly fits real world data confirms some of the model’s implications. The example illustrates that the profit-maximizing price for the product is far greater in the presence of health insurance than it would be for an uninsured population, and consumer surplus decreases dramatically.====We further show that this problem is exacerbated when the insurance bundle must include several monopolized products, such as pharmaceuticals treating different diseases, which is again a feature of most insurance products in the United States and a requirement of Medicare Part D. This result stems from the Cournot complementary monopolist problem where each innovator sets prices without internalizing its effect on the market. Indeed, if the number of monopolized products is sufficiently large, we show that coverage of those products can not only decrease consumer surplus but also total surplus. Importantly, this loss in total welfare is not due to the key force that would operate in a standard moral hazard model—overconsumption of covered medical services. Nor is it akin to the welfare loss in Nyman's model which is due to liquidity-constrained consumers lacking access to affordable insurance. The welfare loss in our model arises because the increase in the prices of the monopolized services eventually becomes so large that lower valuation consumers no longer purchase insurance and therefore forego access to both the monopolized services and the core services. Importantly, this means that even in a situation where insurers could eliminate moral hazard (a primary focus of the design of current insurance contracts) there are still other channels through which insurance can reduce welfare.====While our model can be used to explain any part of the medical sector where providers have some degree of market power, it seems especially applicable to the pharmaceutical sector—a market that is characterized by many products with high and rising prices. These unprecedented high prices have recently received considerable attention from both policymakers and economists including calls for policies that either directly reduce prices (e.g. explicit price controls) or indirectly do so (e.g. increased bargaining rights for government purchasers). Given the potential negative effects on innovation and access that could come from such policies, it is important to understand the determinants of the market prices and their effect on welfare. Our model may help explain the recent increase in the number of oncology products that are covered by health insurance but have been found to not be cost-effective at current prices (Managan, 2015, Loftus, 2015, Walker, 2015).====The novelty of our contribution is in its combined focused on the access motive from health insurance and the role of medical supplier market power when the purchase of health insurance is driven by the access motive. As noted earlier, Nyman, 1999, Nyman, 2003 importantly provides the first formal model of the welfare implications of the access motive. Nyman’s model assumes that prices are exogenous and, in doing so, likely overstates the magnitude of the access benefit accruing to consumers. Other papers in the health economics literature have studied the implications of endogenous price setting by providers of health services that have market power, but they focus on settings that are economically different from ours. For example, Jena and Philipson (2013) show that when a cost-effectiveness measure is based on endogenous prices, a technology or treatment that appears to be more cost-effective than another can actually be less cost-effective when judged on the basis of its social cost. In such cases, policies aimed at raising overall cost-effectiveness could have the counterproductive effect of raising health care spending and increasing the adoption of inefficient treatments. Lakdawalla and Sood (2009) formulate a model in which a monopoly health care provider sells to an insurance firm that, in turn, determines a two-part insurance contract for consumers (premium and cost share). They demonstrate that when different types of consumers can be perfectly sorted into different insurance contracts, health insurance markets can eliminate the deadweight loss from monopoly pricing by the health care provider. When this is not possible, monopoly pricing leads to some consumers remaining uninsured, but it does not result in underconsumption of medical care by consumers. As in these papers, a key assumption in our model is that medical care is priced by a firm with market power. But in contrast to Jena and Philipson (2013), our model focuses on the interaction of medical care pricing and insurance, and unlike Lakdawalla and Sood (2009), health insurance in our model serves as a device to enable liquidity-constrained households to obtain access to medical care as opposed to providing consumption smoothing. As emphasized above, this latter distinction leads to very different implications about the roles of cost sharing and endogenous pricing of medical treatments and is increasingly policy relevant.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 analyzes the pricing of a pharmaceutical product in the face of consumer liquidity constraints. We contrast cases in which insurance does and does not cover the treatment, while allowing for the possibility that insurance involves cost sharing. We characterize consumers’ optimal purchase decisions and the implied demand curve for the treatment; the profit-maximizing price of the treatment; and the resulting levels of consumer and total surplus. Section 3 extends our model to the case in which insurance covers a bundle of medical products and services. It also considers the possibility of multiple innovators. Section 4 discusses the policy implications of our analysis. Section 5 summarizes and concludes.

We assess whether this fear is well founded by examining a reform that permitted Dutch health insurers to freely negotiate prices with ,"Competition between healthcare providers is increasingly encouraged with the aim of improving quality of care while slowing the growth of health spending. When prices are regulated, providers are forced to compete on quality to attract patients or contracts with insurers. When prices are unregulated, the effect of competition on quality is less clear. If demand is more responsive to price than to quality, then the optimal competitive strategy will involve driving down the price and sacrificing quality (Gaynor, 2006). This is a plausible scenario when information on quality is poor. Fear that competition with unregulated prices will be damaging to quality may make regulators wary about allowing healthcare providers to compete on price. However, it is not clear whether this fear is well founded. Providers may not adopt the profit maximizing competitive strategies. Not-for-profit goals, a social mission and intrinsic motivation may lead them to maintain quality even if this means forgoing opportunities to gain a competitive advantage by cutting prices at the expense of quality. Whether quality suffers in competitive healthcare markets with unregulated prices is an empirical question. Evidence to answer it is sparse.====This paper examines the impact of price deregulation on the quality of hospital care delivered in the Dutch healthcare market in which insurers compete for customers and hospitals compete for contracts with insurers. We estimate the effect of moving from financing hospitals through prospective global budgets to allowing insurers and hospitals to freely negotiate procedure-specific prices in contracts for the delivery of DRG-type products. We identify the effect of this price deregulation by exploiting variation in its consequences across hospitals differentiated by the concentration of the market in which they operate. Assuming that free insurer-hospital negotiation of prices creates greater competitive pressure where the market is less concentrated, the difference-in-differences (DID) between more and less concentrated markets can identify a lower bound on the effect of deregulating prices in a more competitive environment.====We estimate the effect of permitting price competition on an elective procedure quality indicator – unplanned readmission after non-acute hip replacement. Higher readmission rates following hip replacement have been shown to be related to suboptimal quality (Rosen et al., 2013; Mokhtar et al., 2012). The institutional context and our empirical strategy facilitate identification without running much risk of the selection bias that most other studies of competition in healthcare markets have avoided only by estimating effects on indicators of the quality of urgent treatments, such as mortality after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (e.g. Kessler & Geppert, 2005; Propper et al., 2008; Cooper et al., 2011; Mutter et al., 2011; Romano & Balan, 2011; Gaynor et al., 2013).==== This restriction of attention to urgent treatments leaves a dearth of evidence on the effect of competition on treatments, such as elective surgeries, that hospitals directly compete for and the demand for which potentially exhibits much greater responsiveness to price and quality (Bevan and Skellern, 2011; Gravelle et al., 2014; Colla et al., 2016; Skellern, 2019). The reform we exploit permitted price competition but left patient choice of provider effectively unconstrained. There was no available information on hip replacement readmission rates, and so patients could not select a hospital on the basis of this outcome. To identify the effect, we separate hospitals into two broad (treatment/comparison) groups according to the concentration of the market in which they operate. If there were any selection correlated with the outcome, it would most likely involve switching between neighboring hospitals that belong to the same group. This would not induce selection bias. Baseline patient (casemix) characteristics are similar across the treatment and comparison groups, changes in these characteristics do not differ between the groups and conditioning on these characteristics has little impact on the estimates.====We find no effect on quality despite examining a situation in which price deregulation had the greatest scope to damage quality – an elective procedure with little information on its quality, potentially leaving the demand of insurer-purchasers more responsive to price than to quality. Over a five-year period after price deregulation, the change in the 90-day hip replacement readmission rates of hospitals in less concentrated markets did not differ significantly from that of hospitals in more concentrated markets that were exposed to less competitive pressure. The insignificant point estimate is small in magnitude – less than 1 percent of the pre-reform readmission rate – and reasonably precisely estimated. Failure to reject the null of no effect is robust to alternative definitions of the market, to comparing hospitals at the extremes of market concentration, to using the 30-day (instead of 90-day) readmission rate, to dropping the most rural hospitals and to using readmission after knee replacement as the quality measure. In the year immediately after price deregulation, we find a marginally significant negative effect on the readmission rate, which is followed by insignificant positive point estimates in later years. This hints at a positive immediate impact on quality that is not sustained when hospitals continue to be exposed to competitive pressures arising from price deregulation. Overall, this study finds no evidence that price deregulation in a more competitive healthcare market damages quality, even when information on quality is poor.",Does price deregulation in a competitive hospital market damage quality?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629618303539,23 May 2020,2020,Research Article,224.0

Evidence from recent studies has shown that Medicaid reduces financial risk to beneficiaries while also increasing access to healthcare services.==== Far less evidence links Medicaid access to long-run improvements in health and mortality, particularly among adults.==== Prior to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) expansion, estimation of the mortality effects of access to the present Medicaid program relied on a small number of state-level actions in the early to mid-2000s (Sommers et al., 2017) and suggestive but underpowered evidence from the 16-month mortality followup in the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment (OHIE) (Finkelstein et al., 2012).====In this paper, we estimate the effects of the ACA Medicaid expansion on adult mortality in the first four years following the 2014 Medicaid expansion. A key part of the ACA, the Medicaid expansion removes categorical exclusions and bases eligibility solely on income at or below 138 percent of the federal poverty level. The ACA Medicaid reform was originally formulated to occur nationwide but was effectively made a state option by the 2012 Supreme Court ruling ====. As a result, just over half of the United States chose to adopt the initial expansion (Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2017). Coverage became effective on January 1, 2014, and over 9 million new individuals between the ages of 19 and 64 enrolled by the end of 2015, accounting for 60 percent of the immediate increase in coverage that resulted from the ACA (Frean et al., 2017).====Our primary analysis compares the post-expansion changes in mortality between counties in states that expanded Medicaid in 2014 with changes in those that did not adopt the expansion. To account for pre-existing differences between these counties and improve the efficiency of our estimation, we use propensity-score reweighting based on economic, demographic, and political characteristics. Two key features of the implementation of our research design serve to discipline the analysis and add credibility to the findings. First, we use the double-lasso method to specify the propensity score model (Belloni et al., 2014a, Urminsky et al., 2016). This data-driven model-selection procedure prevents overfitting, thereby increasing power relative to research designs assessed in Black et al. (2019) (hereafter BHNS). Second, we perform a cross-validation exercise in which we hold out mortality outcomes in the four years before the reform from the propensity score model and check that the reweighted data displays flat pre-trends over this time period.==== Mortality responses, including age and cause of death, are observed in restricted-access microdata for all deaths in the U.S. from 1990 to 2017. Together, this allows us to estimate the marginal impact of public health insurance coverage for areas that adopted the Medicaid expansion and, further, to examine whether changes occur where Medicaid is likely to have the largest effects.====We find evidence of a reduction in mortality following the ACA Medicaid expansion, with the strongest results for amenable causes of death, those most likely to have been averted through optimal quality healthcare. Point estimates on aggregate 4-year mortality indicate an improvement in all-cause mortality among 20-to-64-year-old adults of 11.36 fewer deaths per 100,000 people, a 3.60 percent decrease in mortality. The event study shows flat pre-reform trends and an immediate drop in mortality in the first year following the reform, with evidence of growing effects after that. Changes in aggregate mortality rates are largely explained by a reduction equaling 6.64 fewer deaths per 100,000 people due to amenable causes. We also find a larger reduction in mortality in areas with low rates of health insurance coverage before the expansion. Applying estimates of newly covered individuals in states that expanded Medicaid relative to those that did not, the aggregate effects equate to one additional death averted for each 310 new Medicaid recipients. When interpreting these magnitudes, it is important to note that access to healthcare may have larger effects over longer time horizons than available in our data, and we find growing effects over time.====An essential aspect of our study is that we examine the effect of the program on aggregate mortality, thereby capturing mortality responses for the entire population along all margins. These aggregate mortality results complement two recent papers, Miller et al. (2019) and Goldin et al. (2019), which provide evidence on the effects of the ACA for the Medicaid eligible and uninsured population. Our individual-level treatment-on-the-treated (ITOT) estimates fall within the range of estimates from this emerging literature, although they are subject to some uncertainty regarding the size of the affected population. Using our first-stage estimate of a 4.15 percent decrease in uninsurance in our sample and adjusting for the higher mortality of the Medicaid population implies that the expansion prevented 30 percent of deaths in this population, a large reduction in mortality.==== This ITOT extrapolation relies, however, on several strong assumptions, especially, that the beneficial effects of the expansion were confined to those measured as switching from uninsurance to Medicaid. This assumption would be violated, for example, if there were responses among those who switch onto Medicaid from other sources of insurance, Medicaid affects prospective recipients through presumptive eligibility and retroactive coverage, or if the benefits of health insurance affect households or communities. A number of program features are consistent with the first two violations, while a growing literature documents responses consistent with diffuse benefits of Medicaid on, for example, financial outcomes (Hu et al., 2016, Miller et al., 2018), crime (Vogler, 2017, He, 2018), and hospital closures (Lindrooth et al., 2018). There is also little evidence of negative spillovers through congestion effects (Carey et al., 2018). If instead we scale our estimates to the increase in Medicaid coverage regardless of previous insurance, our estimates imply a 17 percent reduction in mortality. The uncertainty in these calculations leads us to conclude that the evidence is most informative about the reduced-form, aggregate mortality effects of the expansion. We discuss these issues further in Section 4.====At the end of the paper, we examine the relationship between the estimated mortality effects and the cost-effectiveness of the ACA Medicaid expansion. Specifically, we compare program costs to the value of mortality gains using age-specific estimates of the Value of a Statistical Life (VSL) in Aldy and Viscusi (2008). We calculate the benefits of expansion under two sets of assumptions: first, by applying our point estimate for all-cause mortality to the ages 20 to 64 (taking our results at face value); and second, under a conservative scenario in which our results apply only to amenable cause mortality for the 55-to-64 age group (where previous researchers suggest results are most likely to be found, and our results are most robust). These results imply that the mortality benefits offset one-third of the expenditures associated with Medicaid expansion. An economic cost-benefit analysis should weigh the mortality benefits against the efficiency costs of the program, i.e. deadweight loss associated with the crowd out from private insurance and raising tax revenue. Evidence from the OHIE suggests that approximately 60 percent of Medicaid expenditures are transfers, for example, to hospitals through a reduction in unpaid bills (Finkelstein et al., 2016).==== Applying this figure to the ACA Medicaid expansion would imply that the mortality-related savings may cover the entire net cost of the ACA Medicaid expansion. A full accounting of the social welfare effects of the Medicaid expansion should also include benefits to other outcomes, such as quality of life improvements from changes in morbidity and reductions in financial distress among beneficiaries.",Did the ACA Medicaid expansion save lives?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629619306228,19 May 2020,2020,Research Article,225.0

Using the National ,"In the United States, rising healthcare costs have concerned policymakers and the public for decades. The aging of the population and advances in medical technology are partly to blame, but concern has also centered on provider reimbursement. Prior to 1984, hospitals who treated Medicare patients were reimbursed on a fee-for-service basis, giving hospitals the incentive to provide excess services to patients to generate revenues. Believing the fee-for-service model to be unsustainable in terms of costs, in 1984 the federal government implemented the Prospective Payment System (PPS) for reimbursing hospitals for the care of Medicare patients. Under the PPS, a hospital receives a fixed payment for each Medicare patient in a given diagnosis related group (DRG) regardless of the actual cost the hospital incurs for treating that patient. Such systems have now been adopted by many other countries in an effort to control health care costs.====While the actual calculation is a bit more complicated, the DRG system basically works as follows. Each DRG is assigned a relative weight based on the average amount of resources required to care for a patient in that DRG. The DRG weight is then multiplied by the hospital's reimbursement rate. This rate is set by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and adjusted for labor markets, geography, patient demographics, teaching program, and hospital size.==== This calculation determines the total compensation of the hospital for the care of a particular patient. Overtime, the CMS has made changes to DRG weights in order to better reflect the resources used in, and hence the costs of, treating certain conditions. These DRG weights are calculated and published by the CMS annually. Importantly, these weights are prospective. The hospital is only reimbursed for the particular DRG assigned to a patient upon initial diagnosis even if that patient ultimately requires significantly more care.====In 2007, the CMS made a change in the methodology for calculating DRG weights in part based on a concern that the old weights were too coarse, e.g., all patients within a given DRG were not equally ill. With Version 25 of the DRGs (effective October 2007), the CMS revised the DRG scheme. The revision consisted of expanding what was up to 540 DRGs into over 700 Medicare-severity DRGs (MS-DRGs). First, DRGs were consolidated into 335 base MS-DRGs. Of these, 106 were split into two subgroups, and 152 were split into three subgroups, to arrive at 745 total MS-DRGs. The subgroups were based on the presence of complications or comorbidities (CCs) or major CCs (MCCs). This caused a change in the weighting system. For example, patients with a particular illness who had no complications and comorbidities would now be assigned a lower MS-DRG weight than those with comorbidities, to reflect their lower level of illness severity. We provide examples of how DRGs were expanded in Appendix A.====With these changes to the DRG classification system, there was a parallel change to the reimbursement hospitals received for treating patients of different severity levels. Prior to 2008, in the DRG system, patient illness variation within a DRG was not reimbursed differentially. This meant that a hospital would benefit financially when it admitted a patient in otherwise good health who was assigned DRG X, as this patient would, in expectation, require fewer services than the average patient assigned DRG X. Similarly, the hospital would lose financially when it admitted a very ill patient-with many underlying health complications-who also was admitted and assigned DRG X, as this patient would require more than the average amount of services for treating a patient with this illness illness X, but the hospital would be compensated for treating a patient with ‘average’ illness.====With the implementation of the MS-DRG classification system in 2007, hospitals were compensated at a lower rate for the less severe cases within a particular group of MS-DRGs and compensated more for the more severe cases. This move to the MS-DRG system sets up the central question of our research. In particular, after this transition to MS-DRGs, have we seen a systematic shift in the distribution of comorbidities or complications recorded by the hospital? Or posed another way, now that hospitals receive more compensation for severely ill patients, are patients more likely to get coded with additional comorbidities or complications? If so, this would be an example of what in the economics literature is known as upcoding.====Upcoding can take various forms. Patients are usually coded into their DRGs by specialist coders based on medical charts and using special coding software. At the coder level, as Jürges and Köberlein (2015) note, there are legal, semi-legal, and illegal types of upcoding. Legal types of upcoding would be more accurate coding of a patient's condition so that the provider can be reimbursed appropriately for the costs incurred. This is the rationale underlying the change to the MS-DRGs. A semi-legal type of upcoding would include changing the primary and secondary diagnosis regarding comorbidities. Illegal forms of upcoding include adding comorbidities that are not documented in the medical charts or false documentation, i.e. the manipulation of patient charts so that patients appear to be sicker than they really are. The semi-legal and illegal types can in principle be detected in audits but the illegal types are harder to detect, in part because they are typically not coded by hospital administrators but by medical professionals; i.e. doctors or nurses.==== In our case, we define upcoding as the systematic classification of patients into higher severity levels after the 2007 DRG change which, as noted, changed the financial incentives facing hospitals. Using data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project’s (HCUP) National Inpatient Survey (NIS) for the years 2005–2010, we find significant evidence of upcoding but, unlike previous research, we do not find it to be more prevalent at for-profit hospitals. In what follows, we situate our work within the existent literature. We then describe our data and methods and follow with results and a conclusion.",Do hospitals respond to changing incentive structures?

This reduction in fertility translates into a temporary increase in maternal employment.,"In recent decades, the incidence of cesarean deliveries (CDs)==== has substantially increased in almost all OECD member countries. On average, CD rates (i.e., the percentage of all CDs per live births) increased from 14% in 1990 to 20% in 2000 and almost 28% in 2013 (OECD, 2015). In contrast, the recommended CD rate by the ==== is between ==== and 15% (World Health Organization, 2015). It seems indisputable that this upward trend in CD rates can only be partly explained by changes in the incidence of medical indications.==== The rapidly growing number of CDs raises concerns about the effects of non-medically indicated CDs.==== A CD is more costly than a vaginal birth and in many OECD countries, the average cost of a CD is twice or more than that of a vaginal birth (Koechlin et al., 2010). The surge in the number of CDs poses a moral hazard problem in health insurance markets and places an unwarranted burden on healthcare systems (Gibbons et al., 2010). In addition, non-medically indicated CDs may exert direct detrimental effects on the mother or child. In this study, we focus on the far-reaching consequences of CDs on maternal outcomes. More specifically, we investigate to what extent non-medically indicated CDs affect subsequent fertility and maternal labor supply.==== By undergoing a CD, mothers are subject to the risk of reducing their subsequent fertility involuntarily or voluntarily. A CD could cause later physiological reproductive constraints. While surgical procedures have improved over time, CD mothers are still at a higher risk of stillbirth, and ectopic pregnancy due to placental abnormalities (O’Neill et al., 2013a, O’Neill et al., 2014). A CD could also affect fertility through an infection at the wound site or pelvic adhesions (Murphy et al., 2002). On the other hand, CD mothers could voluntarily reduce fertility through different channels. More specifically, the first CD is an indication of subsequent ones and this is associated with a higher risk of complications in future pregnancies (Daltveit et al., 2008). Observational studies show that maternal morbidity progressively increases with the number of CDs (Silver et al., 2006). Second, the recovery period after birth may be longer for CD mothers than those who had a normal vaginal delivery. This may increase the psychological problems after childbirth and reduce the willingness to have another child (Declercq et al., 2006, Weisman et al., 2010). Third, tighter constraints caused by the first child could reduce a CD mother's fertility. A large number of observational studies highlight the negative associations between CD and child outcomes.==== Assuming that this association captures a causal relationship, CD mothers may decide to spend more time and resources on their first born and forgo having another child.==== Both macro and microdata show a negative association between CD and subsequent fertility. Fig. 1 depicts the correlation between CD rates and total fertility rates for 23 European countries. The negative correlation of ==== is significant at the 99.9% level. Likewise, the dominant finding in observational studies based on micro data is that fertility is delayed and reduced after a CD compared to a vaginal delivery (Gurol-Urganci et al., 2013, O’Neill et al., 2013b). Although illustrative, this evidence — much like the above cross-country correlation — does not establish a causal relationship given the endogenous allocation to mode of delivery. A comparison of cesarean delivering mothers (henceforth, CD mothers) and non-CD mothers is most likely biased given the presence of factors promoting CD and affecting the outcomes under consideration.====The potential causal link between CD and fertility has received little attention in the economic literature. A notable exception is Norberg and Pantano (2016), who exploit several data sources and adopt various empirical strategies to explore the importance of maternal choices to identify the (negative) association between CD and subsequent fertility. Although the authors do not claim to identify a causal effect, they provide suggestive evidence for maternal responses as an important aspect of the link between CD and subsequent fertility: CD for an index pregnancy is associated with a lower incidence of future live births, higher self-reported infertility, miscarriage of future pregnancies, and higher overall rate of active contraception. Recently, Card et al. (2018) use an instrumental variables (IV) approach to identify the causal effect of CD for low risk first births in the US. They use the relative distance from a mother's home to hospitals with high and low CD rates as their source of exogenous variation. The identifying assumption is that this variable is not correlated with any unobserved determinants of their outcome variables.==== The focus of their study is children's and maternal health outcomes, but they also examine the probability of a second birth up to 4 years after first birth. They find no clear effects on fertility, but conclude that their ‘====’ as they only have access to five years of data.====Our empirical analysis is based on high quality administrative data from Austria. We use the Austrian Birth Register linked with a employer-employee matched dataset. We observe all births between ==== and ====, along with information on mode of delivery, health indicators for newborns, and mother's socioeconomic information. We focus on nulliparous mothers and match information on their subsequent fertility and maternal labor supply up to 2013. This allows us to contribute in three ways to the literature on the causal effects of a CD on subsequent fertility. First, we provide meaningful estimates of the effect of CD on the probability of a second child up to six years after birth. Second, we are able to inform about the total fertility effects. In particular, we restrict the sample to births earlier than ==== to estimate the effects up to ten years after the first birth. Third, we investigate whether the effects are heterogeneous by maternal education.==== A CD may influence maternal labor supply through potential effects on child health, maternal health or fertility. These channels work in opposite directions. First, mothers may reduce their labor supply to take care of their sicker children. Second, a longer physical and mental recovery may influence the time it takes for mothers to come back to work after delivery, and any long-lasting effects on maternal health may translate into lower participation and/or wages. Last, fertility reductions may translate into higher employment.====Bailey (2006) estimates the fertility and labor market effects of another technology—the introduction of the oral contraception pill—and finds that it reduced teenage pregnancy, increased female labor force participation and the number of working hours substantially. One could expect smaller positive effects from a CD if the procedure affects subsequent fertility. The existing causal evidence on the effects of a third child on employment (Angrist and Evans, 1998, Maurin and Moschion, 2009) suggests that the effects of subsequent children on maternal employment are relatively small and disappear in the long-run. Our paper then also contributes to the scarce literature on the effects of birth-related technologies on maternal labor market behavior.==== We analyze whether a non-medically indicated CD affects subsequent fertility behavior and maternal labor supply. To establish a causal link, we exploit three facts. First, obstetricians have considerable control over whether a delivery is vaginal or cesarean. Second, hospitals face capacity shortages for surgical procedures on weekends and public holidays. Third, obstetricians have a preference for leisure on weekends. As a result, despite nature's almost uniform distribution of births across time, one finds differential likelihoods of CDs across days of the week. This holds true after excluding planned CDs, which are always scheduled on working days. There is a ==== percentage point lower likelihood of a CD on weekends and public holidays and a ==== percentage point higher likelihood on Fridays and working days preceding public holidays. We argue that the differential likelihood of a CD for expectant mothers admitted to a hospital on a certain weekday is driven by obstetricians’ demand for leisure and not correlated with factors related to the mother or child. Accordingly, we exploit this variation in CDs across weekdays using an IV approach.====The first IV is the delivery on a weekend or public holiday and the second is delivery on a Friday or any other working day before a public holiday. Our identifying assumption is that the weekday of admission is not correlated with the unobserved determinants of subsequent fertility or labor supply. While this assumption cannot be fundamentally tested, it is reassuring that women admitted on different days of the week are observationally identical. Their unadjusted means of socioeconomic characteristics are indistinguishable, they have the same average labor market history, and equal health expenditure prior to birth. One potential concern regarding the exclusion restriction of the first (but not second) IV is the quality of medical services provided on weekends or public holidays. Due to lower staffing and availability of clinical services, medical quality could be lower. This could lead to the subsequent reduction of fertility. While there is little empirical evidence on reduced quality in neonatal units on weekends, such an effect would provide us with a more conservative result. We find very similar results for both IVs.==== Our main result is that non-medically indicated CDs (triggered by hospitals’ free surgical capacity or obstetricians’ demand for leisure) reduce subsequent fertility permanently and increase maternal labor supply over a period of about six years. The probability of a second birth decreases by about ==== percentage points and the likelihood of a third birth by ==== percentage points after ==== years. This translates into a 13.6% reduction in lifecycle fertility. The resulting increase in maternal employment (over a period of ==== years after the first birth) generates an additional maternal labor income of about 17%. The estimated treatment effects on fertility are very similar by maternal age and education. By contrast, labor supply effects are driven by highly-educated mothers. All estimated treatment effects are highly statistically significant and similar across both IV approaches.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

We first document significant and robust positive effects on ,"The hydraulic fracturing (i.e. fracking) boom has resulted in incredible growth in the US energy industry. Following technological innovations in horizontal drilling, shale production began to surge in the late 2000s, and by 2012 US tight oil production had reached 2.5 million barrels of oil per day and shale gas production had reached 30 billion cubic feet per day according to the Energy Information Administration. Between 2000 and 2010 the number of natural gas wells nearly doubled from 276,000 to 510,000.====This boom has transformed local economies in certain parts of the country and significantly increased local employment and incomes (Feyrer et al., 2017, Maniloff and Mastromonaco, 2017). But the boom has also impacted several non-economic outcomes. Cascio and Narayan (2015) find increased high school dropout rates among males in fracking areas due to the higher return on unskilled labor. Kearney and Wilson (2018) find positive effects on birth rates, consistent with children being a normal good. A number of papers have found large increases in both property and violent crime rates (James and Smith, 2017, Andrews and Deza, 2018, Komarek, 2018, Street, 2019).====In this paper we examine the effects of fracking on an outcome that has received relatively little attention: risky sexual activity. We utilize sexually transmitted infections (STIs) as an outcome that is associated with risky, unprotected sexual encounters. STIs cost the American health care system an estimated $16 billion in direct medical costs annually (Satterwhite, 2013). We estimate the causal effect of fracking booms on three bacterial STIs using a county-level semi-parametric difference-in-differences model similar to James and Smith (2017), where the treatment group is defined as any county lying over a booming shale play to exploit exogenous geographic variation. We find that fracking caused county-level gonorrhea rates to increase by 16.1 cases per 100,000 people as of 2013 (which is roughly 24% of the sample mean). We find no effect on syphilis transmission, on the other hand, suggesting that the impact was primarily rooted in changes in the heterosexual network. We also find no effect on chlamydia transmission which may be due to the asymptomatic nature of that particular STI, which we discuss further in Section 2.====While it is clear that the transmission of these infections is due to unprotected sexual intercourse, identifying the vectors of the spread of infections is critical for these communities. Given the remoteness of many fracking locations, the male dominance in the labor market opportunities, and the thinness of local dating markets, it is unlikely that such spread is occurring exclusively from casual sexual encounters. Indeed, as has been noted by many investigative reporters,==== prostitution services have made their way into certain fracking regions.====To examine the impact of the fracking boom on the local prevalence of sex services/workers, we utilize a popular website used by clients of sex workers. This website, called The Erotic Review, has been used numerous times to better understand illicit sex markets (see Cunningham and Kendall (2011); Cunningham and Shah (2018); DeAngelo et al. (2019)) due to the site's national presence and the increased role that online reviews played in the organization of contemporary US sex markets (Cunningham and Kendall, 2016). We find heterogeneous effects of fracking on the number of reviews per capita (our proxy for commercial sex activity in a county). For our full sample, where the treated group is any county lying over a booming shale play, we do not find evidence of increased prostitution activity caused by fracking. This suggests that sex work may not be the central driving mechanism in the fracking led increase in gonorrhea. However, we do find moderate evidence of increased prostitution activity in areas where the boom was especially pronounced (described further below).====Because the fracking boom impacted communities in a myriad of ways, isolating any one mechanism of effects on risky sexual activity is difficult. Fracking booms draw males that are on average less educated (Cascio and Narayan, 2015) or more likely to have criminal backgrounds (James and Smith, 2017). Increased incomes could impact prostitution activity if prostitution is a normal good.==== But an important and plausible mechanism that we highlight in this study is changes in the local sex ratio (the ratio of males/females). The vast majority of oil and gas workers are male (IHS, 2016), and Wilson (2016) documents that migrants into fracking areas were significantly more likely to be male and unmarried. Adimora et al. (2001) and Adimora et al. (2004) note that imbalanced sex ratios can cause increased sexual concurrency.==== Edlund and Korn (2002) develop a model of prostitution that suggests imbalanced sex ratios can increase STI spread if the selected males are temporary residents. These men will shift from the marriage market towards non-procreative sex, and this may include increased demand for prostitution. Empirical evidence on how major male in-migrations impact risky sexual activity includes Mao et al. (2018) and Cunningham and Kendall (2011), though strong causal evidence for a persistent shock to sex ratios remains elusive.====James and Smith (2017) found that the fracking boom increased county-level sex ratios, but the average magnitude was quite small. However, this estimate was an average based on all 204 counties lying over a booming fracking play (the same baseline treatment group used in this study), most of which likely did not experience severe fracking labor shortages, which could make the average uninformative. We therefore attempt to identify fracking areas with pre-boom conditions that could plausibly lead to large changes in the sex ratio by way of male in-migration due to local labor shortages. We identify seven counties with a sufficiently sized city for a prostitution market to develop, and that are both nearby an especially large production boom and in a remote area. Each of these counties either are or are within commuting distance of a county that became significantly more gender-imbalanced towards males during the fracking boom.==== We run a restricted-sample difference-in-differences analysis with the treatment group limited to these counties. We find considerably larger effects on gonorrhea transmission than for the full sample. We do not find effects on total prostitution reviews per capita, but do find moderate evidence of positive extensive-margin prostitution effects, measured by whether a county has any non-zero number of reviews. Further, we generally do not find effects on these outcomes for cities that are close to highly productive fracking plays but also near other cities, or for cities that are isolated but not near fracking, suggesting that the combination of a large fracking boom and remoteness is a key causal factor. We view these results as suggestive and consistent with a sex ratio mechanism, though ultimately we still cannot fully separate sex ratios from the other mechanisms discussed above (negative selection of migrants, income effects).====This study contributes to the extensive literature on how fracking booms impact local communities. To our knowledge, only two other studies have examined STI transmission effects from fracking booms, or resource booms more generally. Komarek and Cseh (2017) find that gonorrhea transmission increases in fracking counties relative to non-fracking counties within four states lying over the Marcellus formation in the Northeast United States. Deziel et al. (2018) examines the effect of shale gas activity on STI transmission for a single state (Ohio, one of the four Marcellus states) from 2000 to 2016 using Poisson models with random effects and find increases in gonorrhea and chlamydia and no effect on syphilis.====We expand on these studies in several ways. We analyze the entire United States rather than one region. We use a less parametric specification that estimates how effects evolve over time and allows evaluation of parallel conditional pre-trends between the treatment and control groups. We further test the robustness of the estimated effects in several ways, including the restricted sample analysis described above. To our knowledge, we are the first to rigorously analyze the effects on sex work activity (as measured by online reviews) from a fracking boom or resource booms more generally. Finally, we explore how sex ratios and locational remoteness are linked to the effects on risky sexual behavior, which is of broader interest to the public health community.====The remainder of the article explains the theoretical mechanisms linking fracking with public health, the data and models used for estimation, our results and a brief discussion of the implications this study has for policy.",Fracking and risky sexual activity,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629619308513,15 May 2020,2020,Research Article,228.0

In 2015, there were 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the U.S., representing 3.4% of the country's population and more than 5% of its labor force (Krogstad et al., 2015). Despite a recent slowdown in the influx of undocumented immigrants into the U.S. (source: PEW Research Center on Migration), regulating their status without further increasing illegal immigration remains a crucial challenge for the government. Legalization programs have been historically used as a policy tool to foster immigrants’ integration and well-being. The debate on the costs and effectiveness has become even more relevant with the announced changes in the U.S. immigration policy that are currently under discussion.====Illegal immigrants constantly face the threat of deportation and the lack of work permits, access to credit, and access to government welfare programs (e.g. Medicaid, unemployment insurance, Social Security). These challenges can have detrimental effects on their human capital and productivity. Previous research shows that illegal immigrants have substantially lower hourly wage rates (for both genders), family income, and higher male labor force participation rates than their legal immigrant or native-born counterparts (Capps, 2007, Rivera-Batiz, 1999, Borjas, 2017). Studies also suggest that legalization of these immigrants can increase their probability of being employed, participate in the labor force (Kossoudji and Cobb-Clark, 2002, Devillanova et al., 2014, Amuedo-Dorantes and Antman, 2017, Pope, 2016), can lead to a significant growth in their wages (Rivera-Batiz, 1999) and contribute to private sector GDP (Edwards and Ortega, 2017). At the same time there is evidence that programs requiring employers to check workers’ eligibility to work legally in the US reduce average hourly earnings among likely unauthorized Mexican immigrants (Orrenius and Zavodny, 2015).====Most of the political discussion on immigrant legalization programs focuses on the potential costs associated with regularizing undocumented immigrants. Yet little is known about how legalization affects public programs take-up. There are two notable exceptions. In a recent study, Cascio and Lewis (2016) explore the effects of the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) on Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), and find that areas with higher applicant shares experienced relatively large increases in EITC transfers after IRCA. Borjas and Slusky (2017) use counterfactual analysis to estimate the additional public costs of legalizing the undocumented population by estimating models of disability as a function of medical conditions. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no analysis of the effects of immigrant legalization on health insurance coverage and health care use, and only a few recent studies have considered the effects on health outcomes (Venkataramani et al., 2017, Hainmueller et al., 2017). Our paper intends to fill this gap in the literature.====We focus on the effect of a large-scale immigration policy change – 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). DACA is an executive memorandum issued by President Obama on June 15, 2012, which provides certain unauthorized immigrants who came to the U.S. as minors with temporary reprieve from deportation and work authorization (DACA status can be renewed every two years). Although DACA does not provide a path to citizenship or a ==== legal status, one can think of it as a (temporary) ==== immigrant legalization.====To estimate the effects of DACA, we employ a difference-in-differences strategy exploiting the discontinuities in the DACA eligibility criteria. We confirm that DACA-eligible immigrants are more likely to participate in the labor force and some evidence of an increase in income (Pope, 2016). Using American Community Survey data, we document that DACA eligibility increased health insurance coverage. We show that DACA increased insurance coverage throughout the country by enhancing individual ability to purchase private plans. In California and New York (among the three states with the highest DACA-eligible population), where Medicaid eligibility was granted to DACA recipients, the increase in insurance coverage was mostly driven by an increase in public insurance coverage. Despite the increase in insurance coverage, using data from the National Health Interview Survey and the California Health Interview Survey, we find little evidence of significant effects on health care use, although after 2012, DACA-eligible individuals reported more mental health care visits. On the other hand, we provide evidence that DACA increased the likelihood of reporting a usual place of care and reduced the likelihood of deferring care due to financial reasons. There is also some evidence of improvements in mental health outcomes and self-reported health. These effects are largely driven by subjects with income below the federal poverty level. Our findings are consistent with the evidence from the Rand Health Insurance Experiment and the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment (Aron-Dine et al., 2013, Finkelstein et al., 2012, Kamberg and Newhouse, 1985) showing that health insurance coverage had no or little effect on physical health, but possibly improved perceived health and mental health among the population at higher risk. Yet, differently from the results of these two large insurance interventions, we find little evidence of an increase on health care use. The lack of a significant impact on health care use is likely explained by the demographic characteristics of the DACA-eligible population.====Our paper is closely related to a handful of recent studies analyzing the economic effects of DACA. Pope (2016) documented the positive effects of DACA on the labor market opportunities of undocumented immigrants. There is also evidence that DACA reduced the likelihood of life in poverty (Amuedo-Dorantes and Antman, 2016), while Ortega et al. (2018) estimate that DACA increased GDP by almost 0.02%. The evidence on the effects of DACA on human capital is less conclusive. Amuedo-Dorantes and Antman (2017) and Hsin and Ortega (2017) show that DACA may have incentivized work over educational investment. However, using administrative data from California, Kuka et al. (2018) find evidence that DACA increased high school graduation rates and college attendance. Finally, a few recent studies examined the effects of DACA on health. Venkataramani et al. (2017) using data from the National Health Interview Survey provide evidence that economic opportunities and protection from deportation can have large positive effects on the mental health of undocumented immigrants, confirming associations found by Patler and Pirtle (2017). Using Medicaid claims data from Oregon, Hainmueller et al. (2017) find that children of DACA-eligible mothers had 50% fewer diagnoses of adjustment and anxiety disorder than children with non-eligible mothers. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to provide a systematic analysis of the effects of DACA on insurance coverage, access to care, health care use, and health outcomes, analyzing different data sources and a wide set of health care and health outcomes in the same study. Furthermore, our findings highlight that the effects of DACA on stress and mental health outcomes are concentrated at the bottom of the income distribution. Our findings mirror recent evidence on the health and mental health effects of local immigration enforcement (Wang and Kaushal, 2018).====The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the background, illustrates the data and identification strategy.

Excluding individuals with substance use disorders, smoking rates for adults with any past-year mental illness were 33% in 2012–2014, as compared to 21% among others (Lipari and Van Horn, 2017). Disparities are evident among adolescents as well (Chang et al., 2005). Moreover, while overall smoking rates have fallen over the past few decades, they have remained virtually unchanged among those with mental illness (Szatkowski and McNeill, 2015). These lasting disparities have motivated calls to designate smokers with concurrent mental health diagnoses as a priority group for intervention (Williams et al., 2013). While various models of rational addiction (e.g., Becker and Murphy, 1988; Orphanides and Zervos, 1995) and time inconsistent preferences (e.g., Gruber and Köszegi, 2001; O’Donoghue and Rabin, 1999) attempt to explain smoking behavior generally, the drivers behind mental health disparities therein remain unclear.====This paper considers a potential explanation: use of addictive substances as a means to cope with mental distress. While smoking entails significant long run costs, it also offers a distinctive short run benefit: a rapid shift in the user’s mental or emotional state. Specifically, nicotine consumption prompts the release of dopamine in regions of the brain associated with positive affect and the reward system (Stolerman and Shoaib, 1991; Burgdorf and Panksepp, 2006; Yuan et al., 2015). Thus, when acute distress induces particularly high disutility, the ability to immediately alleviate this via cigarette use may outweigh the expected costs of engaging in that behavior. This “coping response” framework could apply to a range of behaviors, from use of other addictive substances to sexual intercourse and even eating.====This theory is similar to but distinct from psychology’s self-medication hypothesis (Khantzian, 1985). The latter typically focuses on individuals with diagnosed mental health and/or substance use disorders, and posits that those struggling with addiction select their drug of choice to counteract painful emotional and/or psychological states, via the drug’s pharmacological effects. In contrast, a coping response would apply to the general population and would not require that individuals accurately match a drug’s pharmacologic impact to their mental state, since experimenters may not know enough about their individual response to a new drug to do so.====As the vast majority of smokers initiate in adolescence (Lillard et al., 2013), longitudinal data from the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth’s young adult cohort are used to consider the relationship between acute mental distress and adolescent smoking. Respondent fixed effect and lagged dependent variable regressions examine how adverse events known to precipitate mental distress affect use of conventional cigarettes. Specifically, violent crime victimization and death of a non-family member to whom the respondent felt close are both covered by these data and listed on the National Center for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder’s Life Events Checklist (LEC), a validated instrument for mental distress related to traumatic events (Gray et al., 2004). Controls for key confounders as well as falsification and selection tests are used to increase confidence that these events are exogenous conditional on observables.====Results indicate that adverse events yield statistically significant increases in first use of cigarettes, past month smoking, and daily smoking. Reassuringly, future shocks show no such effects. Moreover, those with higher baseline depression scores exhibit larger smoking responses to subsequent shocks, a result that is not explained by differential shock-responses by maternal education, peer pressure to smoke, or neighborhood parental supervision. Back of the envelope estimates suggest that greater responsiveness to shocks among those with poor mental health explains 32 percent of the initiation gap between respondents scoring in the highest and lowest terciles of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CESD). Additionally, the smoking-response to shocks is dampened among those facing higher cigarette taxes. This combination of findings is consistent with the use of smoking as a coping response to distress.====Critically, the coping response framework implies a natural intervention to reduce smoking: timely and effective mental health care. Indeed, in considering the impact of FDA warnings regarding anti-depressants’ safety on youths’ human capital investments, Busch et al. (2014) find that these warnings were associated with increased recent smoking and illicit drug use among depressed 12–17 year-olds, but not those who were not depressed. A coping response predicts exactly this result. The fact that reduced antidepressant access triggered these shifts points to mental health care as a means to address coping-related substance use, as well as disparities therein.====The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 outlines the coping response framework, while Sections 3 and 4 describe the data and methods, respectively.

Recently, these markets have been changing, especially on the demand side. For one thing, considerable consolidation of both health insurers and PBMs has occurred.==== Additionally, consumers have gained increased drug insurance coverage, both through broad-based policies like the Affordable Care Act and more targeted ones like Medicare Part D. Such coverage expansions may increase drug utilization, but also inherently consolidate demand as instead of disparate individuals purchasing drugs, a relatively small number of insurers increasingly represents many consumers. A logical question is how these changes in market structure affect manufacturer behavior. Such manufacturer responses could have far-reaching impacts on the pharmaceutical market: by affecting how aggressively brands defend their exclusivities and by altering the decision of generics to enter the market, the key policy levers over drug innovation and pricing, respectively, may be shifted. Yet, despite the possibility that the dual trends of demand-side consolidation and coverage expansion continue, little research has focused on how manufacturers respond.====Importantly, whatever response exists to coverage expansion is likely to differ by the nature of the manufacturer. For branded manufacturers, the consolidation of the demand side of pharmaceutical markets may encourage further protection of their own market power to counteract increasing purchaser bargaining power. Increased utilization pushes in the same direction, as a monopolist’s markup on every unit is more valuable the more units are sold.====One way to extend monopoly power – and one focus of this paper – is through a strategy known as “evergreening.” This practice may lengthen the time a drug manufacturer maintains the exclusive ability to market a version of its product by obtaining additional FDA approvals or patents that modify the original product.==== For example, a product may be evergreened by obtaining approval for an extended release version of the original drug, or a version with a different strength, innovations that may have clinical value (e.g., by improving adherence to a treatment regime), but do not represent a fundamentally new development.====A stylized example of these dynamics (in Appendix B) highlights these considerations, showing that the incentive to hold on to some measure of monopoly power increases as drug utilization expands with increased insurance coverage. At the same time, a general downward pressure on prices due to the accompanying consolidation of buyers has ambiguous effects on the brand’s incentive to maintain exclusivity. This effect depends on the brand’s ability to maintain its market share of the original drug with the entrance of generics relative to its market share selling the evergreened version of the drug while competing with generic versions of the original. Overall, the evergreening response to increased coverage is an empirical question.====For generic manufacturers, their primary decision – market entry, the other focus of this paper – could be affected in the negative direction by increased demand side consolidation and any resultant downward pressure on prices, but in the positive direction by demand expansion.==== Such behavioral responses on the part of generic manufacturers would be important to take note of, since drug pricing policy in the United States relies heavily on price competition from generics.==== Thus, a change in generic entry could either lead to rising prices, or place the burden of constraining prices on other parties (such as insurers). The goal of this paper is to analyze how branded and generic manufacturers respond when faced with the sorts of demand-side changes that have recently altered pharmaceutical markets, and what effect, if any, the behavioral change might have on prices.====Empirically, the challenge in estimating pharmaceutical manufacturer responses to demand consolidation is isolating a situation where demand changes, but other factors are constant. To this end, this paper takes advantage of the introduction of Medicare Part D, which extended prescription drug insurance to all Medicare enrollees. Aside from the obvious expansion of coverage caused by the program (e.g., as shown by Engelhardt and Gruber 2011), Lakdawalla and Yin (2015) point out that a side-effect was increased insurer bargaining power. In other words, Part D engenders the kind of change being experienced by pharmaceutical markets more broadly. However, the policy only effected this kind of change for certain drugs – those used by individuals age 65 and over – and took effect at a discrete point in time. The paper uses these two features of Part D to identify the effects of insurance coverage expansion on manufacturer behavior.====This question is related to one addressed in Dranove et al. (2014), who look at how Part D affected different kinds of biotechnology innovation, and found that the reform predominantly increased incremental innovation. Although they point out that this suggests the innovations had little welfare benefit, the current analysis does not attempt to gauge the welfare impacts of different kinds of innovation. Rather, the analysis focuses on the responsiveness of different kinds of manufacturers to changes in demand.==== Still, it is worth noting that should a response by branded manufacturers exist, it suggests strategic behavior on their part that indicates some behavior detrimental to consumers, regardless of whether or not the induced innovation is actually valuable. If the innovation is not valuable, the response prolongs monopoly pricing without spurring useful R&D; if the innovation is valuable, the response indicates that this useful R&D was withheld from consumers longer than it could have been.====Practically, the project uses the ==== (MEPS) merged onto the complete set of drug approvals from 1984 to 2016 to perform a difference-in-differences analysis. The analysis compares the pre- and post-Part D periods separately for drugs used primarily by those ages 65 and over and drugs used mostly by those 65 and under. Since many drugs are used by both age groups, the approach takes the form of a “dose-response” analysis, interacting the share of a drug’s pre-reform uses by those over 65 with a post-Part D indicator to tease out the effect of Part D on the relevant outcome. In this analysis, the drugs used primarily by those under age 65 serve as the control group for any secular trend in evergreening, generic entry, or prices.====The quasi-experimental findings suggest that the insurance expansion due to Part D increased the frequency of evergreening on the part of branded manufacturers (by 6.2 percentage points, p < 0.1) and decreased the incidence of generic entry (by 20 percentage points, p < 0.01) for a drug fully exposed to Part D (i.e., used exclusively by over-65 year olds). These effects correspond to large relative changes in evergreening and generic entry for a drug with average exposure to Part D of 20 percent and 45 percent, respectively.====As far as the timing of these changes, both increased evergreening activity and reduced generic entry began soon after passage of Medicare Part D. Trend breaks are visible as soon as 2004, the year following the reform and, importantly, two years prior to expansion of insurance coverage in practice in 2006. The speed with which manufacturers reacted suggests that the innovations behind the induced evergreening were not developed due to the reform, but merely held in reserve and deployed when the incentives faced by brands changed. Furthermore, the response occurring prior to the expansion of coverage suggests that these new products were not marketed benevolently in order to benefit consumers as they gained insurance coverage, but rather strategically, in response to the changing incentives faced by the firms.====However, while both increased evergreening and reduced generic entry would seem to push towards higher prices, in fact, prices fell for drugs used frequently by seniors relative to other products. This result does not mean that the increase in evergreening and decline in generic entry had no impact on prices. Descriptive results supplementing the quasi-experimental approach show that drugs with an evergreening exclusivity were 10 percent more expensive than similar drugs without such protections, while every additional generic entrant was associated with 9 percent lower prices per prescription. While the finding that overall prices have fallen due to Part D is consistent with previous work, the finding that evergreening has increased and that generic entry decreased is new to the literature, as are the descriptive results relating evergreening to prices.==== The results suggest that while manufacturers do respond to the sorts of demand-side changes recently experienced in pharmaceutical markets in ways that could increase price, the increased bargaining power of insurers more than offsets these behavioral effects, at least in the context of Part D.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section offers background on the practice of evergreening and on how Part D may affect it. The third section discusses the data and empirical approach, and the fourth presents results. The final section concludes that the expansion of drug insurance seems to have spurred an increase in evergreening and a decline in generic entry, and that these effects modestly offset some of the price declines Part D caused. Policymakers considering the approval of mergers and acquisitions on the demand side of the pharmaceutical industry or further expansion of insurance coverage should be aware of these effects, as well as more generally cognizant of the shifting burden of constraining drug price growth from generic competitors to buyers as coverage expands.",Drug insurance and the strategic behavior of drug manufacturers: Evergreening and generic entry after Medicare Part D,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629619305703,1 May 2020,2020,Research Article,231.0

Using detailed household level panel data on food purchases I find that healthfulness of grocery purchases is very persistent in the short-run. Three to four decades after moving, however, households have closed about half of the gap in healthfulness between the origin and destination area. The results suggest that dietary habits are highly persistent, but may eventually shift in the face of different local environments.","One-in-three adult Americans are obese, and another one-third is considered overweight.==== Obesity is among the top three preventable causes of death in the US (Danaei et al., 2009) and medical costs associated with adult obesity were estimated at $147bn in 2008 (Finkelstein et al., 2008). Poor diet is shown to be an important driver of differences in obesity rates (Cutler et al., 2003, Park et al., 2015) and significant funds have been allocated to promoting healthy diets.====Evidence to date suggests that dietary choices are generally difficult to change, however. Diets appear persistent both in the face of changes in the local environment or food options (Atkin, 2016; Allcott et al., 2019) and in response to changes in household-specific circumstances (Oster, 2017, Hut and Oster, 2018). Most of the evidence is based on specific stimuli or changes in food options, however, and has been limited to a relatively short time-horizon of a few years.====In this paper, I study the broader impact of the local environment on dietary choice - foods purchased for at-home consumption in particular - over both a short- and long time horizon. To assess how changes in the environment shape nutritional quality I document changes in grocery purchases among households that move within the US. The results confirm earlier findings that dietary choice is sticky, but also provide suggestive evidence that the quality of grocery purchases may be more malleable over the course of several decades.====In order to measure healthfulness of household grocery purchases over time I combine the Nielsen HomeScan panel, a dataset of household food purchases, with product-level nutrition facts. The Nielsen data contain Universal Product Code (UPC) level grocery purchases for a large number of households across the US over time, making it uniquely suited to tracking household food purchases over time and across geography. I construct two index measures of healthfulness of grocery purchases based on measures in Handbury et al. (2015): (1) the nutrient ratio, which is a composite measure based on the nutrients in all purchases and (2) the expenditure score, a composite measure based on food group spending shares. In addition, I construct two more easily interpretable measures: (1) the share of purchases in soda and sugar-based categories and (2) the share of purchases in vegetables, fruits and whole grains.====To measure healthfulness of grocery spending at the area-level I construct the same measures by ZIP code and state based on grocery store sales in that area in the Nielsen Scantrack data. These data contain weekly sales and prices by UPC for over 30,000 retailers in the US. The measures confirm that the nutrient content of foods purchased for at-home consumption varies substantially across geography, in a way that correlates highly with reported obesity rates.====The movers analysis consists of two parts. In the primary analysis, I examine relatively short-run changes in the healthfulness of grocery purchases for households that moved within the time frame of the HomeScan panel. This approach closely resembles the analysis of changes in grocery purchases among movers in Allcott et al. (2019). The key advantage of this set of recent movers is that I observe their purchases before and after a move, which allows me to study within-household changes in the nutrient content of grocery purchases as a function of the change in area-level healthfulness. Second, I study the evolution of food purchases among households that have been in the destination area for a longer period. In this part of the analysis I rely on survey data on current and past states of residence for a subset of the Nielsen HomeScan panelists from Bronnenberg et al. (2012). Together with information on the years since the move, I use these movers to study how current food purchases relate to the average food purchases in the origin and destination over the course of several decades. This part of the analysis relies on stronger assumptions, which I explicitly discuss and examine in the paper. Given these limitations, however, the long-run analysis provides suggestive evidence of how the quality of grocery purchases might evolve over a longer period.====The short-run analysis of recent movers shows that healthfulness of household grocery purchases is virtually unchanged in the first two years following a move. I identify recent movers in the panel and infer the moving month from changes in household residential ZIP codes and their primary store's ZIP code. I use these movers to study how grocery purchases change around a move using an event-study design with household fixed effects. This closely follows the approach taken in other papers that examine consumer migration, most notably Allcott et al. (2019) and Finkelstein et al. (2016). The results demonstrate that the quality of household grocery purchases is sticky in the short-run: at most 3 percent of the gap in healthfulness between the origin and destination is closed in the first 24 months following a move. To illustrate how movers help to deal with issues of endogenous sorting in this context, I show that a naïve cross-sectional analysis of a household's own food purchases on their neighbors’ food purchases would gravely overestimate the effect of place in the short-run.====The key identifying assumption for the short-run analysis is that the timing of a household's move does not coincide exactly with other shocks that are correlated with both the healthfulness of a household's own grocery purchases and with the difference in healthfulness between the origin and destination. Income changes or changes in household composition are the most obvious candidates for such a shock. I show that while a subset of moves coincide with household income shocks, income changes are not predictive of the change in area level healthfulness. In addition, move years are more likely than non-move years to coincide with household composition changes, but the results are robust to limiting to households who do not show such a change. Furthermore, I argue that any other unobserved changes in lifestyle or household characteristics would likely generate an upward bias in the estimated effects of moving, which seems less concerning given that I do not find a change in the quality of grocery purchases in the short run.====The long-run analysis of movers, who moved before entering the panel, shows that over time the quality of food purchases converges about halfway to the average in the destination area. For this part of the analysis I rely on within-household variation in the years since the move to study how healthfulness of food purchases evolves over several decades, relative to the origin and destination state. This is similar to the approach in Bronnenberg et al.'s (2012) study of brand preferences. The results show that migrants that have been in their destination state for three to four decades on average have closed about 50% of the gap in healthfulness between the origin and destination state.====Because I do not observe grocery purchases before the move for this set of movers, these results should be interpreted with more caution. A key assumption underlying the long-run analysis is that households do not selectively migrate and re-migrate. While the use of within-household (as opposed to cross-sectional) variation addresses some of these concerns, the results could be biased if the decision to relocate is correlated with a household's changes in food purchase behavior over time. For example, it is possible that households that decide to stay in an area are more open to changing their behaviors, including the quality of their food purchases. Such selection would imply that the estimates of food purchase changes in the data would overstate the change we would expect to see in the general population.====A second limitation of the long-run analysis is that I do not observe diet in the origin state at the time of the move. While not perfect, I use current healthfulness of grocery purchases in the origin state as a proxy for past healthfulness. I test this assumption by comparing area-healthfulness in 2006 and 2016 in my data. In expectation past area-level healthfulness equals today's area-level healthfulness, suggesting geographic patterns in diet quality have been relatively stable over time. In addition, I show that state-level obesity rates between 1990 and today have remained stable in relative terms.====In the last section I discuss the implications of these results for the potential drivers underlying the observed geographic variation in the quality of food purchases. The results rule out two potential drivers, including large and fixed differences in inherent food preferences across space and short-run constraints imposed by the retail environment. Since the store environment changes discretely around the move, the results appear inconsistent with factors such as local product availability being immediate constraints for the healthfulness of grocery purchases. This is further exemplified by the absence of a short-run change in the quality of purchases upon moving to or from areas defined by the USDA as food deserts. Instead, the patterns of change suggest that dietary habits shift slowly over time. This suggests that individuals have food habits and preferences that are persistent, but that over time such habits are susceptible to changes in the local environment. These changes may be driven by neighbors or peers, through social interactions, or by long-run effects of the retail environment or product marketing. Future empirical work could attempt to examine these channels more directly by relying on social network data.====This paper relates to a literature on drivers of metabolic habits, and consumer dietary intake more specifically. In particular, my paper relates closely to Allcott et al. (2019), which shows that food availability is not a primary driver of the observed variation in diet quality. Allcott et al. (2019) also use movers to examine the effect of place on household diet in the short-run. Similar to my results, they find that household diet is virtually unchanged in the short-run. While the results largely overlap, the analysis in this paper was conducted independently. In addition, I build on these findings by examining long-run changes in diet following a move, and I provide novel evidence suggesting that household diet is more malleable over the course of several decades.====Second, this paper relates to a literature on the persistence of food preferences. My paper is closely related to Bronnenberg et al. (2012), which documents strong evidence of persistent brand preferences among migrants. I use the same scanner data and measurement framework. While Bronnenberg et al. (2012) study migrants primarily to examine how past experiences affect current brand choices, I exploit migration to study how diet responds to a change in one's environment. In addition, I explicitly examine the costs of persistent food preferences by studying nutrition and related health outcomes. Atkin (2016) studies nutrition among migrants in India, and also finds strong persistence of diet by showing that people are willing to give up valuable nutrients to maintain their preferred diet. I add to this by studying dynamics through changes in diet as a function of the amount of time spent in the destination, and also by studying the US context where diet quality issues are different from those in India.====Section 2 introduces the scanner and nutrition data and describes the measures of nutritional quality of grocery purchases used in this paper. I also show descriptive facts of the geographic variation in nutritional quality across space. Section 3 outlines how I identify movers in the data and the empirical strategy for both short- and long-run movers. Section 4 presents the results. Section 5 discusses several potential underlying drivers of the observed changes in grocery spending and related policy implications.

While international integration of national generic markets can improve welfare, such is not the case if it causes home to relax its ERP policy.","The high prices charged by some pharmaceutical companies for their branded products are a serious health issue confronting consumers and policy-makers alike.==== Governments concerned with limiting the adverse impact of such pricing behavior on consumers have a variety of price regulations at their disposal.==== In addition to direct price controls, governments can utilize indirect price regulations such as ==== (ERP) under which the price that a government permits a seller of a particular product to charge in its local market depends upon the seller's prices for the same product in a well-defined set of foreign markets.==== Not only is such international referencing of prices practiced by a host of European countries, it has also been raised quite recently by President Trump as a possible means for lowering pharmaceutical prices in the United States (US).====Of course, price regulations are not the only means for curtailing the market power of firms selling branded pharmaceuticals. Market competition from generics that possesses the same therapeutic qualities as branded products can potentially help achieve the same objective. The welfare gains resulting from generic competition have induced some countries to take measures aimed at increasing generic penetration rates in their markets. For example, in March 2015 France launched a national plan to promote the use of generics as part of the country's cost containment efforts. Furthermore, there seems to have been a decline in the market exclusivity periods enjoyed by branded drugs in some countries, mainly due to the more aggressive marketing strategies of generic manufacturers – see Dirnagl and Cocoli (2016).====Rules and regulations governing generics differ across countries but, generally speaking, generic producers are allowed to enter the market for a branded pharmaceutical product only after the patent underlying the branded product has expired or been successfully challenged in court. In the US, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly known as the ====, establishes the process via which firms can seek approval for producing generic molecules from the United States Food and Drug Administration (Lakdawalla, 2018). Provisions of this Act and analogous regulations in other countries give governments at least some ability to control the intensity of generic competition facing branded products in their markets. The duration of data exclusivity periods – during which generic producers are not permitted to use the safety and efficacy data generated by patent-holders – is one potential policy tool via which regulatory agencies such as the US FDA control the barriers to entry facing generic producers in their markets (Lakdawalla, 2018). For example, the Hatch-Waxman Act provides for a data exclusivity period of roughly 8 years in the US whereas the analogous period in Europe can be up to 11 years.====Our objective in this paper is to shed light on whether and how the presence of generic competition alters the welfare rationale behind two commonly used pricing regulations, i.e., ERP and direct price controls. Our analytical approach generalizes the two-country model of Geng and Saggi (2017) who examine cross-country policy linkages between ERP and price controls for patented products. There are two major modeling innovations of this paper relative to Geng and Saggi (2017). First, unlike Geng and Saggi (2017), the present paper allows for generic competition in each country's market. Second, this paper also derives the implications of allowing the home government to weigh firm profits differently than consumer surplus thereby providing a more general welfare analysis of ERP policies and price controls than Geng and Saggi (2017).====Incorporating generic competition in each market substantially generalizes the scope of Geng and Saggi (2017) since it makes their model applicable to pharmaceuticals that are under patent protection as well as those that are not (whereas the analysis of Geng and Saggi, 2017 applies only to patented products). This generalization is important since many countries (such as Austria, Portugal, and Slovenia to name a few) also apply ERP policies to branded pharmaceuticals that are no longer protected by patents. Moreover, an attractive feature of our modeling approach is that it captures the idea that the processes for the approval and marketing of generics differ across countries: an independent country-specific parameter measures the degree of therapeutic competition faced by the branded product in each market. This approach allows us to independently vary the intensity of generic competition in each country. For example, we can shut down generic competition in any market by setting the parameter measuring the degree of competition in just that market equal to zero.====Explicitly incorporating generic competition in the model in this way allows us to explore several real-world questions that are simply beyond the scope of Geng and Saggi (2017). More specifically, we address the following novel questions: How does a country's optimal ERP policy for a branded pharmaceutical depend upon the degree of generic competition faced by it? What type of international spillovers, if any, does local generic competition generate in the presence of an optimally chosen ERP policy? Does stronger generic competition enhance or reduce the welfare efficacy of an ERP policy? Do the welfare effects of generic competition depend upon whether such competition is national or international in scope?====In the model, a single firm produces a branded pharmaceutical product that it sells at home and potentially also in a foreign market. Since home consumers are assumed to value the product relatively more than foreign ones, the firm's optimal price at home is higher than that abroad. While the firm faces local generic competition in each market, it is free to price discriminate internationally since international arbitrage is assumed to be forbidden by the government of the high price market (i.e. home). As Lakdawalla (2018) notes, the international segmentation of markets created by such restrictions gives government some leverage over local pharmaceutical prices and motivates the use of various types of price regulations on their part. Before delving into an analysis of how policy choices of governments interact internationally, we first consider a scenario in which the foreign country is policy inactive and the only policy instrument available to the home country is an ERP policy that stipulates the maximum price ratio (====) that the firm is permitted to sustain across countries (i.e. the foreign country serves as the reference country for home's ERP policy). We show that, given that the firm sells in both markets, home's ERP policy generates a negative international price spillover: it ==== the price abroad just as it lowers it at home. Of course, the firm is subject to the ERP pricing constraint ==== and can therefore choose to evade this constraint altogether by electing to sell only at home.====When facing an ERP policy in its home market the firm weighs the incremental profit gain that accrues from selling in the foreign market against the adverse impact that charging a lower price abroad has on its profit in the domestic market (due to the presence of an ERP policy at home). The home government, in turn, sets its ERP policy taking the firm's profit incentive into account. We show that, regardless of the degree of generic competition in each market, under home's optimally chosen ERP policy the firm (just) prefers serving both markets to selling only at home. Furthermore, the effect of generic competition on home's optimal ERP policy is determined by its location. Stronger generic competition at home lowers the firm's domestic profit and makes the foreign market relatively more appealing thereby increasing its incentive to export. This in turn allows the home government to ==== its ERP policy. On the other hand, stronger generic competition abroad makes the foreign market less attractive to the firm, which induces the home government to ==== its ERP policy in order to maintain the firm's export incentive. Although the two types of generic competition have opposing effects on home's optimal ERP policy, the welfare gain enjoyed by the home country from instituting an optimally calculated ERP policy declines in the intensity of generic competition in ==== market. This welfare result implies that the ERP policies and generic competition act as ==== so that the rise of generic competition in global markets should be expected to reduce the incentives that governments have to implement ERP policies and related price regulations.====An important insight of our model is that the presence of an ERP policy at home causes generic competition in one market to spill over to the other market. Moreover, whether this international spillover is positive or negative in nature depends crucially on the responsiveness of home's ERP policy to changes in the degree of generic competition as well as the location of such competition. Specifically, holding constant home's ERP policy, an increase in generic competition in either market lowers prices in ==== countries. But when home's ERP policy is endogenous, a strengthening of generic competition at home ==== the firm's price in the foreign country whereas a strengthening of generic competition in the foreign market ==== price at home (because it forces the home government to relax its ERP policy to maintain the firm's export incentive). As one might expect, these price adjustments imply that the welfare effects of changes in generic market competition in the two countries are rather different in nature. In particular, while an increase in home generic competition raises welfare in both countries and is therefore Pareto-improving, an increase in foreign generic competition can actually hurt the home country and even lower joint welfare.====We build on our core ERP model by extending it to a three-stage policy game in which the foreign government is also policy active. In the first stage of this policy game, the home government chooses whether to impose a local price control (====) or an ERP policy (====) on its pharmaceutical producer. Next, the foreign government sets its local price control (====).==== Finally, the firm decides whether to export and then sets its price(s). Analysis of this policy game delivers several novel insights. First, in the presence of an endogenously chosen foreign price control, an increase in foreign generic competition ==== global welfare if the home country's market is relatively large compared to the foreign market. Second, the larger the size of the domestic market relative to the foreign one, the less likely it is that the home government prefers an ERP policy to a price control. This is because an increase in the relative size of the domestic market reduces the importance of safeguarding the firm's foreign profits (which we find to be the main advantage of an ERP policy over a price control). Third, domestic and foreign generic competition have rather different effects on home's choice between the two policy instruments: greater generic competition at home tilts the home government's choice in favor of an ERP policy whereas greater foreign competition has the opposite effect. Fourth, the higher the weight that the home country puts on firm profits relative to consumer surplus, the more likely it is that it prefers an ERP policy to a direct price control.====For the bulk of our analysis we assume that generic competition faced by the branded pharmaceutical product is local in nature. To determine how the scope of generic competition affects our main results, we also analyze the consequences of integrating the two national generic markets into a single global market. There are good practical reasons for addressing this question. For example, the European Union (EU) has been consistently pushing for a more integrated generic market for pharmaceuticals among its member states. There are multiple procedures within the EU through which a generic medicine can be approved simultaneously by more than one member state. Under the ==== a generic medicine, once approved by any one member state, is automatically approved for sale in all the EU member states. Another approach relies on the principle of ==== under which a generic drug approved by one country (called the “reference member state”) is automatically cleared for sale in all other countries that recognize the first country's standard (called “concerned member states”). Both approaches can help integrate national generic markets that tend to be segmented due to international differences in regulations pertaining to the approval and sale of generics. We show that while the international integration of national generic markets can improve welfare, such is not the case if it results in a relaxation of home's ERP policy.====While we focus on reference pricing in an international context, reference pricing can also be internal and/or domestic in nature – under such policies drugs are grouped together according to some equivalence criteria (such as therapeutic quality) and a reference price within the same market is set for each group.==== Brekke et al. (2007) provide an analysis of such internal reference pricing in a model in which two firms selling horizontally differentiated brand-name drugs compete against each other and a third firm selling a generic version, that like in our model, is perceived to be of lower quality by consumers. They compare the effects of generic and therapeutic reference pricing both with each other and with the complete absence of reference pricing.==== One of their important findings is that therapeutic reference pricing generates lower prices than generic reference pricing.==== Motivated by the Norwegian experience, Brekke et al. (2011) provide a comparison of price caps and reference pricing and show that whether or not reference pricing is based on market prices or an exogenous benchmark price matters a great deal since generic producers have an incentive to cut prices when facing an endogenous reference pricing policy, which in turn makes the policy preferable from the viewpoint of consumers.==== Using a panel data set covering the 24 best selling off-patent molecules, Brekke et al. (2011) also examine the consequences of a 2003 policy experiment where a sub-sample of off-patent molecules was subjected to reference pricing, with the rest remaining under price caps. Their key finding is that prices of both brand names and generics declined due to the introduction of reference pricing while the market share of generics increased.====Our paper also contributes to the literature on the economics of exhaustion policies which determine whether or not holders of intellectual property rights (IPRs) are subject to competition from parallel imports which in turn determines their ability to engage in international price discrimination.==== We add value to this literature in two important aspects. First, we focus on how ERP policies and price controls are possible means for controlling prices as opposed to potential competition from parallel imports. Second, while this literature focuses almost exclusively on patented products, our analysis focuses on branded products that face competition from generic producers.",Optimal price regulations in international pharmaceutical markets with generic competition,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629619303844,6 April 2020,2020,Research Article,233.0

Further, food insecurity is a barrier to health care utilization (Kushel et al., 2006; Berkowitz et al., 2018) and recipients of food benefits generally have lower levels of health care expenditures (Berkowitz et al., 2017).====There are several possible mechanisms that might explain an effect of food insecurity on health outcomes. First, food insecurity may be associated with non-adherence to costly medications (Bengle et al., 2010; Berkowitz et al., 2014; Knight et al., 2016) or delay of needed medical care (Kushel et al., 2006). This has been previously identified as a problem among older adults that use SNAP (Srinivasan and Pooler, 2018). Second, times of food insecurity are associated with higher stress levels that could have negative spillovers into health (Bradley et al., 2018; Fiese et al., 2016). Finally, food insecurity could negatively affect mental health and exacerbate undesirable behaviors (de Mores et al., 2016; King, 2018; Gassman-Pines and Bellows, 2016).====The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is the largest safety net program designed to alleviate hunger. It currently provides benefits to over 40 million individuals. There is a substantial literature that evaluates how effective the program is at alleviating food insecurity.==== Additionally, a growing literature documents that benefit receiving households’ consumption and purchasing behavior changes across the SNAP benefit month (Hastings and Washington, 2010; Castellari et al., 2017; Wilde and Ranney, 2000; Hamrick and Andrews, 2016). Perhaps most notably, Shapiro (2005) documents a 10–15% decline in caloric consumption between the first and last week of the benefit month. Relatedly, the likelihood an individual on SNAP is classified as food insecure is substantially higher at the end of their respective benefit month (Gregory and Smith, 2018). Taken together, these findings suggest that the benefit cycle might correlate with cycles of health outcomes. More specifically, as individuals move further from benefit receipt in their respective month, their health might deteriorate. There is also the possibility that changes in their behaviors might lead to increased health care utilization. There is also reason to suspect that possible effects of food insecurity vary by age across the SNAP benefits cycle. For example, the very young and the older populations might be more vulnerable to illness exacerbated by food insecurity. Further, research shows that older populations are more vulnerable to cost-related non-adherence for prescription medications (Briesacher et al., 2007) and that school-aged children use school meals to help smooth consumption (Kuhn, 2018).====In contrast to the mechanism described above, household behavior immediately upon receipt may be altered in ways that are associated with negative health outcomes. That is, the day of food stamp receipt might be associated with behavioral responses that are unrelated to food insecurity. For instance, Phillips et al. (1999) report an increase in mortality across nearly all types of death in the first week of the month, which coincides with many transfer payments as well as income receipts. Evans and Moore (2011 and 2012) investigate this association more completely and trace the mortality cycle directly to the arrival of income and general economic activity, with the most pronounced effects among liquidity-constrained populations. One possible explanation is that income/benefit receipt is associated with increased drug or alcohol use. Indeed, Dobkin and Puller (2007) show the receipt of disability benefits is associated with increases in drug-related hospitalizations and mortality. Carr and Packham (2019) suggest another possible mechanism: increased domestic conflict within families on benefit receipt date. Thus, if SNAP benefit receipt is associated with increased drug or alcohol use or domestic conflict, then we might expect an increase in ER utilization on those dates. In contrast to these findings, Cotti et al. (2016) look specifically at the monthly timing of SNAP benefits and find a reduction in alcohol-related fatal accidents on the day of benefit receipt, possibly through altered household behaviors those days. Additionally, and importantly, several papers (e.g., Hastings and Washington, 2010; Castellari et al., 2017; etc.) have shown a notable increase in grocery shopping on SNAP receipt days, which might alter household schedules and lead them to delay other household-related activities, including seeking medical care.====In this paper, we investigate the timing of SNAP benefits and emergency room (ER) visits. We use administrative data on all SNAP recipients under the age of 65 who are also on Medicaid in South Carolina. For a given day, we calculate several measures of interest. First, we measure the share of ER visitors within this population that visited the ER more than three weeks after their most recent SNAP benefit distribution (e.g., in a more food insecure position), which we call the long-wait share, and compare this to the share of the total SNAP population that we expect are actually more than three weeks into their respective SNAP benefit cycle based on the actual SNAP distribution schedule. We find that, on average, the long-wait share in the ER is no higher than the long-wait share in the population. However, among SNAP recipients over the age of 55, the long-wait share is 1.67% higher and the average number of days since receipt of benefits is also slightly higher. When we restrict the analysis to recipients whose long-wait periods of their benefits cycles correspond with days near the end of the calendar month, we find that the effect is much larger. When we break our long-wait analysis down to specific conditions that have been studied regarding food insecurity in the previous literature, we find no comprehensive effects on these specific conditions. However, we do see positive and significant increases in ER visits for both asthma and incidents of anxiety or depression when the long waits coincide with the end of the calendar month.====Using a similar approach, we also compute the share of ER patients observed within this population that received their SNAP benefits each benefit distribution day and compare it to the share of the SNAP population that received benefits that same day. We find that the share that received their benefits on the day they visited the ER is 3.1% lower than we would expect by random chance. A supplemental analysis using data from the American Time Use Survey finds supportive evidence that day of benefit receipt is associated with less time receiving health care. When we break our day-of-receipt results out by different conditions, we find a consistent negative effect associated with the day of receipt. The effect is negative and statistically significant for 20 of the 25 most common conditions. However, we do not find any evidence of an effect for certain conditions like pregnancy-related complications, which we would not expect to be impacted by time use allocation decisions. These results are consistent with a large literature that documents ER use for non-emergency or primary care services. That is to say, certain care may be delayed on the benefit receipt date.====These results have several public policy implications. First, the cyclical nature of ER visits suggests there is a public policy interest in helping households smooth consumption. This could be accomplished by increasing benefits or by possibly splitting benefits into multiple distribution dates. Although, the latter could exacerbate food insecurity if households face large transportation costs that make multiple shopping trips costly or if splitting benefits prevents households from taking advantage of bulk shopping. Related, our results suggest that the timing of benefits within the month might also be important. If households receive other benefits or income early in the month, distribution of SNAP benefits later in the month may have positive effects. Second, these results highlight that, at least for the older SNAP recipients, there are serious health manifestations over the benefit cycle month, especially when this coincides with the calendar month. Efforts to fight hunger might focus on this subgroup as the consequences of food insecurity are more severe. Lastly, the results highlight the salience of non-urgent use of the ER, which, given the high cost of care in emergency settings, is an important area to understand.====This paper is organized as follows: the section that follows describes the related literature and the contribution of this paper, Section 3 covers important background information and discusses the data, Section 4 discusses the empirical methodology, Section 5 presents the main results regarding food scarcity, Section 6 presents the results related to the day of receipt, while Section 7 concludes.",Hunger pains?

In this paper, we estimate the long-lasting effects of PCP practice styles on patient ==== to compare patients who switch to PCPs with different practice style intensities. We find that PCPs have large effects on a range of aggregate utilization measures, including physician and outpatient spending and the number of diagnosed conditions. Moreover, we find that PCPs have large effects on the quality of care that patients receive, and that all of these effects persist for several years. Our results suggest that switching to higher-quality PCPs could significantly affect patients’ longer-run health outcomes.","Medicare spending comprises $706 billion of the U.S. federal budget, and it is projected to grow by more than 7% over the next decade (CMS, 2019). For reasons that have not been fully understood, Medicare spending has varied significantly across patients in the U.S., both within and across geographical regions (Fisher et al., 2003a, Fisher et al., 2003b, Sinaiko et al., 2019). Understanding what drives variation in utilization is important for policy efforts that aim to reduce spending and improve care. For example, if demand side factors, such as patients’ medical needs, drive spending differences across patients, then policies that improve patient health may reduce health care spending. On the other hand, if supply side factors, such as physician beliefs or incentives, predominantly drive spending, then policies that target the provider side may prove more effective.====Accordingly, recent research has identified factors that drive the variation in health care spending and utilization across patients in the U.S. Specifically, Finkelstein et al. (2016) decompose regional spending variation into its demand and supply side components by analyzing Medicare patients who move across regions. They conclude that 40–50% of the cross-regional variation is due to supply side factors.==== In addition, a growing body of research documents variation in utilization and quality of care across specific health care providers, ranging from hospitals to specialists, and examines the implications of such “practice style” variation for patient outcomes.====Within the practice style literature, however, primary care physicians (PCPs) are a relatively understudied provider group. Characterizing PCP practice styles and estimating their effects on patients’ utilization has been hindered by data challenges—i.e., the limited availability of large-scale data sets that include patient-provider linkages—as well as concerns about patient-physician selection. Yet, PCPs could be responsible for significant variation in utilization and patient outcomes because they are institutionally positioned to play a central role in health care provision. In the U.S., they provide frontline health care to most of the insured population, and they do so through several functions; they diagnose conditions, treat illnesses, prescribe drugs, and refer patients to specialists. PCPs also have more continuous interactions with their patients than other types of health care providers, who may only interact with patients occasionally to treat acute conditions. The fact that PCPs are so intricately involved with health care provision means that PCP practice styles could significantly affect patients’ health care utilization trajectories, particularly if patients lack information about the kind of care they should receive.====In this paper, we show how PCP practice style intensity—across a wide range of measures and functions—affects the care that patients receive. We take a broad approach in defining practice style intensity, allowing factors that are “intrinsic” (such as beliefs or skills) or “extrinsic” (such as incentives and health care system capabilities) to create variation in physician behavior. We use data on a 20% sample of Medicare patients from 2007 to 2013 to exploit variation in PCP practice styles within patients over time. Specifically, we follow 195,000 patients who switch PCPs after having lost their original primary care providers due to “exits,” i.e., their PCPs move to other regions or leave the Medicare program. We focus on patients affected by PCP exits because the exits are likely exogenous to the patients’ underlying health trajectories. As such, our variation in PCP practice styles comes from differences between the new and the old PCPs’ practice style intensities. We further leverage the richness of the data to categorize PCP practice styles across many dimensions, ranging from primary care office-based spending to total spending to emergency department visits and the probability that patients receive guideline-consistent care. This allows us to analyze outcomes that are closer to and further from the PCPs’ direct locus of control. We are thus able to assess the range of impacts that PCPs have on patients’ health care utilization, measured in terms of quantity and quality.====Our research design employs a standard event-study approach where the treatment intensity varies across patients who are affected by PCP exits. We estimate dynamic difference-in-differences specifications for each health care utilization outcome, where we show how utilization evolves around the PCP exit for patients with varying degrees of changes in practice style intensity between their new and old PCPs. Our stylized statistical model, which closely follows Finkelstein et al. (2016), shows that our event study estimates measure the share of variation in utilization across patients within regions that is attributable to PCP practice styles. The identifying assumption in our quasi-experiment is that the underlying trends in health care utilization across patients who experience differential changes in practice style intensity after their PCPs exit do not systematically differ. In support of this assumption, we show that there are virtually no differential pre-trends across patients with varying degrees of treatment intensity for the range of outcomes that we study.====Our main findings are as follows. Across our entire set of outcomes, PCP practice styles immediately impact patient health care utilization at the time of a new patient-physician match, and the effects persist for at least six years thereafter. To varying degrees, PCP practice styles affect all types of spending (i.e., physician, drug, outpatient, inpatient, post-acute care, and total), encounters with different types of health care providers (i.e., number of office visits, emergency department visits, and avoidable hospitalizations), the number of diagnoses that patients receive, and the probability that patients receive guideline-consistent care (i.e., flu vaccinations; eye exams and A1C and lipid screening tests for diabetic patients). This is the case even when we focus on patients who switch to PCPs within the same physician group, where other health care system factors are less likely to vary. As an example of our results, we find that patients who switch to PCPs with $100 higher primary-care spending intensity see their own primary-care related spending increase by an average of $76 in the years following the switch. Importantly, the effects of PCP practice styles are also large for outcomes related to high-quality care. When we examine influenza vaccinations, which are recommended annually for all patients over 65 years old, we find that patients who switch to PCPs with 10 percentage point higher vaccination rates are 6 percentage points more likely to get vaccinated themselves. The relationship between PCPs’ propensity to provide guideline-consistent care for diabetic patients and patients’ receipt of such care is even larger. Overall, our results point to far-reaching and long-lasting effects of primary care physician practice styles on both the quantity and quality of patient health care utilization and, hence, potentially on patient health. In turn, our results suggest that health policies aimed at expanding high-value care and reducing low-value care might be most effective if targeted at PCPs.====Some recent and concurrent work studies primary care physicians and their practice styles in countries other than the U.S. In Denmark, Koulayev et al. (2017) study whether PCPs affect patients’ adherence to medications; Laird and Nielsen (2018) use patient migrations to study regional variation in PCP prescribing rates; and Simonsen et al. (2019) use practice closures to examine the effects of health care disruption and assess the role of physician practice styles in explaining the disruption effects. In Norway, Grytten and Sorensen (2003) estimate variation across PCPs for a range of practice styles, and in Israel, Alkalay et al. (2019) examine how PCP practice patterns change in the face of time constraints. While these papers are indeed relevant and informative for our application, they study institutionally different settings; the U.S. health care system is known to be different from (and often an outlier to) other countries in the developed world in important aspects, including pricing, provider reimbursement, cost-effectiveness analysis, and performance.==== There is arguably less regulation of medical care in the U.S., even in Traditional Medicare, and patients may have more choices over providers. Hence, variation in PCP practice styles and its effects on patient care may be different in the U.S. relative to other OECD countries.====Our paper is most closely related to the recent limited work on primary care physicians in the United States. Cutler et al. (2019) use vignettes from surveys of patients and physicians, linked to Medicare expenditures, to determine whether patient factors or physician factors (such as physician beliefs about treatment) explain regional variation in spending. In contemporaneous working papers, Zhang (2018) and Kwok (2019) study patient–physician separations to focus on the consequences of primary care disruption in the Medicare population.==== Kwok (2019) additionally studies how health care utilization differs across patients who switch to high versus low spending PCPs, combining both physician-initiated and patient-initiated switches.====Our paper contributes to the U.S.-focused literature on practice style variation in several ways. First, our approach to estimating the causal effects of PCP practice styles isolates variation that is generated by plausibly exogenous patient-physician separations (i.e., PCP exits). Second, we examine the broadest range of PCP practice styles, including styles that reflect low-quality care (number of emergency department visits and avoidable hospitalizations) and styles that reflect high-quality care (flu vaccinations and recommended diabetes care). We additionally examine the complementarity between primary care and other types of health care utilization, showing that patients who switch to PCPs who provide more primary care often experience increases in spending on other types of care. Lastly, our paper contributes to the larger literature on health care providers and their quality in the U.S., where PCPs have been distinctly understudied. To the best of our knowledge, our paper may be the most comprehensive evaluation on the importance of PCP practice styles in the U.S. to date, providing evidence in support of large and persistent effects on the quantity and quality of care that patients receive.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows.

This holds even comparing children of the same mother. The effects of HVY adoption on mortality are larger for rural children, boys, and low-caste children. While we are not able to explore mechanisms in depth, our evidence points to a limited role played by increased investments in early childhood health or selection into childbearing in response to HYV adoption.","Between 1960 and 2000, India’s infant mortality rate dropped from 163.8 per 1000 live births to 66.6 per 1000 live births. This impressive decline took place during the same decades in which India made astounding gains in agricultural productivity from 0.86 tons per hectare for wheat in 1960 to 2.79 tons per hectare in 2000, in large part due to research and implementation efforts that took place during the Green Revolution. By examining the relationship between agricultural productivity gains and infant mortality, this paper sheds new light on the intersection of two major developments in India and also extends prior work that has identified several factors behind poor child health outcomes across the developing world: inadequate health care seeking and participation by distressed mothers in the labor market (Bhalotra, 2010), ==== factors (Currie and Vogl, 2013), low levels of public expenditure on health infrastructure (Paxson and Schady, 2005; Cutler et al., 2002; Maluccio et al., 2005) and lower per capita income (Pritchett and Summers, 1996), among others. Our analysis stretches from 1966 to 1998 and covers much of India, allowing us to examine the impacts of these gains for a country where agriculture is the main source of income for a large fraction of the population.====Our study focuses on perhaps the single most important source of agricultural productivity gains: the adoption of high-yielding varieties (HYV) of seeds. The adoption of HYV began in the late 1960s in India with the advent of the Green Revolution and has continued ever since. The gains from HYV adoption are documented in the literature on the Green Revolution (e.g. Evenson and Gollin (2003a)). In this paper, we show the reduced form relationship between HYV adoption and infant mortality across districts of India over time. In particular, a one standard deviation increase in the share of cultivated area planted to HYV in a child’s year of birth reduces infant mortality by 0.50 percentage points. This is substantial relative to the average infant mortality over births of 9.5 % in our sample.====Our empirical strategy addresses standard concerns that can arise in examining the effect of HYV adoption on infant mortality. For instance, individuals might sort into high HYV adoption districts based on the characteristics of those districts. If the characteristics that are associated with sorting also affect infant mortality, then this could bias our results. Furthermore, individuals born in different years could be subjected to economic events, such as recessions, which could drive part of the correlation between HYV adoption and infant mortality. To address these concerns, our baseline specification includes district fixed effects that absorb all time-invariant characteristics of the district that are associated with HYV adoption and also affect infant mortality. It also includes year of birth fixed effects that account for any shocks to infant mortality, such as recessions, that coincide with the year of birth but affect macroeconomic conditions beyond the level of a district. We also include, in alternative specifications, state-specific linear time trends or state by year fixed effects in our baseline estimates. The first takes into account any unobserved trending variables that may vary by state-specific birth cohorts, and the second accounts for any annual pattern in birth outcomes that may differ across states.====Our baseline specification, therefore, compares two children from the same district who are subjected to different levels of HYV adoption based on their years of birth, over and above any unobserved shocks to infant mortality that vary by the year of birth, and any long-run trends (or annual patterns) in infant mortality in the state of birth.====To uncover the mechanisms through which HYV adoption affects infant mortality, we use three different strategies. First, we examine heterogeneity in the effect of HYV adoption across various sub-groups. We find that HYV adoption has a greater effect on children born to mothers who were married younger and who have less education, i.e. mothers whose characteristics predict greater child mortality. The effect is also greater for a child born to a low-caste mother, which suggests that children from poorer households are helped more by HYV adoption. However, the effect is smaller when the child born is a girl. Finally, the effect is greater for a child born in a rural area, implying that the effect of HYV adoption was primarily mediated through agricultural incomes and general development of rural areas.====Next, we examine whether early childhood investments, which might increase due to exposure to the Green Revolution, can explain part of the effects we observe. We find no evidence that such investments mediate the effect of HYV adoption on infant mortality; hence, rural health infrastructure that might correlate with the Green Revolution might not have played an important role in this instance. Finally, we investigate whether HYV adoption affects infant mortality by influencing the profile of mothers who give birth. We find little evidence that predetermined maternal or child characteristics respond to HYV adoption.====One of the greatest limitations of this paper is the lack of a clean natural experiment, which would allow for truly exogenous variation in HYV adoption across districts. Districts in India are large, and even though we exploit variation due to spread of HYV within a district over time, concerns about how states allocate funds to districts for projects that could be correlated with investments in Green Revolution (such as schooling and infrastructure) are first order. In order to move the needle towards a causal interpretation, we carry out several empirical exercises to show the robustness of our baseline results. First, we show that replacing district fixed effects with mother fixed effects gives results that are close to the baseline estimates. That is, when comparing two children born to the same mother, the child whose birth coincided with a greater prevalence of HYV cultivation is more likely to survive. Then, we address the concern of broad secular trends in infant mortality at the district level influencing our results. To do so, we carry out two empirical exercises. The first involves including district-specific linear time trends in our baseline specification and showing that our results do not change in terms of sign or significance. The second involves using an event-study specification that interacts eventual HYV adoption at the district level with year fixed effects to show that there are no differential time trends in infant mortality prior to the Green Revolution. We carry out several other robustness tests, which form the bulk of the analyses presented in the Appendix.====We contribute to the broader literature on the microeconomics of technology adoption. For example, there are cross-country studies that analyze the social, economic and political impacts of technology adoption across both agricultural and non-agricultural sectors. Nunn and Qian (2011) examine the effects of potato adoption in Europe, and Bustos et al. (2016) investigate the impact of agricultural productivity gains on non-agricultural economic activity. There are also more focused studies examining whether agricultural science and research impact economic or social outcomes at a smaller geographical scale (Hornbeck and Keskin, 2014; Fan et al., 2000; Meinzen-Dick et al., 2003; Dalrymple, 2008). Finally, the literature identifying sources of child health outcomes is also well developed (Bhalotra, 2010; Maluccio et al., 2005; Paxson and Schady, 2005; Cutler et al., 2002; Pongou et al., 2006).====However, to our knowledge, very few studies exist that connect productivity gains from agricultural technology adoption to child health outcomes in micro-economic data. The first contribution of this paper is, therefore, to add critical evidence in this space by examining the impacts of HYV adoption on infant mortality in India. In that regard, this paper is similar to the work of Barnwal et al., 2017, who use geospatial data from multiple countries in the Demographic Health Surveys to examine how adoption of modern crop varieties affects infant mortality globally. Barnwal et al.’s results for South Asia suggest that complete coverage by modern varieties would reduce infant mortality by 22 percent, while our results would have that number at around 27 percent. Another related paper is the work of Brainerd and Menon (2014) who examine the specific relationship between fertilizer agrichemicals in water and child health in India. Since the use of HYV seeds is typically accompanied by increased fertilizer use, in light of the findings of Brainerd and Menon (2014), we interpret our results as being net of the effects of fertilizer use.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we provide the background to our study. In particular, we document the development of the HYV of two major crops – wheat and rice – and their diffusion in India. We also postulate mechanisms that link HYV adoption to health outcomes. Section 3 describes the infant mortality data, the HYV data and the procedure we use to match the infant mortality data to the HYV data. Section 4 outlines our empirical strategy. Section 5 discusses our results. Section 6 investigates mechanisms linking HYV adoption to infant mortality. Section 7 reports robustness exercises.

Exploiting ==== based on the exact starting dates of winter heating across different cities, we estimate the contemporaneous impact of winter heating on air pollution and health. We find that turning on the winter heating system increased the weekly Air Quality Index by 36% and caused 14% increase in mortality rate. This implies that a 10-point increase in the weekly Air Quality Index causes a 2.2% increase in overall mortality. People in poor and rural areas are particularly affected by the rapid deterioration in air quality; this implies that the health impact of air pollution may be mitigated by improved socio-economic conditions. Exploratory cost-benefit analysis suggests that replacing coal with natural gas for heating can improve social welfare.","China’s winter heating policy is one of the largest and most expensive energy welfare policies in the developing world. During the winter-heating seasons, large centralized coal-fired boilers provide free or heavily-subsidized indoor heating to residential and commercial buildings in northern China. As emissions from coal combustion are the major anthropogenic contributor to air pollution in China, these boilers cause a significant deterioration in air quality when they are in use (Xiao et al., 2015). The health impact of this sudden and widespread environmental degradation has not been thoroughly examined.====This paper assesses the impact of winter heating on air pollution and health utilizing regression discontinuity (RD) designs based on the turning-on dates of the heating systems in northern Chinese cities. We collected data on the exact dates when the winter heating systems were turned on for 114 northern Chinese cities from 2014 to 2015; we compare air pollution and mortality levels around the turning-on time. As the dates of turning-on the winter heating systems are pre-determined and arguably orthogonal to other health risk factors (such as weather conditions) that may affect population health, the Chinese winter heating program provides a compelling natural experiment to estimate the causal effects of air pollution on health.====We have three key findings. First, there is strong evidence that air quality deteriorated immediately with the onset of winter heating. On average, we observe the Air Quality Index (AQI) increased by 40 points (36%) at the onset of the winter heating. After further examining the meteorological data, we conclude that the changes in air quality were caused by winter heating, rather than by variations in weather conditions.====Second, we find that the sudden deterioration in air quality caused by winter heating immediately increased mortality. On average, the weekly mortality increased by 14% with the start of the winter heating. This effect is driven mostly by extra deaths from cardiorespiratory diseases, confirming air pollution as the causal factor. Heterogeneity analyses further show that the deterioration in air quality increased mortality rates for the elderly, but not for young people. We find that increased mortality is heavily concentrated among economically disadvantaged groups, i.e. residents in rural and low-income areas.====Third, combining these results, we can estimate the causal impact of air quality on mortality using a fuzzy RD (instrumental variable) framework. Our analysis shows that a 10-point increase in AQI will lead to a 2.2% increase in weekly mortality and that a 10-μg/m==== increase in PM==== concentrations will lead to a 2.5% increase in mortality. This size of the effect is substantially larger than the OLS estimates, suggesting the OLS estimates can be severely biased. In addition, unlike the OLS estimate which is sensitive to the inclusion of and different weather controls, our fuzzy RD estimates are remarkably robust to different specifications, suggesting that the air pollution variations caused by turning on the heating systems are indeed orthogonal to the factors that tend to confound the OLS estimates.====Our findings contribute to the existing literature in four major ways. First and foremost, we are among the first to extend the air pollution effect studies to rural areas and highlight the long-overlooked disparity in air pollution exposure between urban and rural areas. As air quality monitors are often placed in urban areas, the majority of the existing studies focus on outcomes of urban residents, who tend to be richer, more educated, take more avoidance behaviors, and have better access to medical services.==== Arguably, these factors can reshape the pollution-health relationship, as richer and more educated people may be better informed about the potential harms of pollution and can also get faster access to urgent medical care when necessary. Indeed, when we separately investigate the urban and rural subsamples, we find the effects of air pollution for rural residents are more than 3 times larger than those for urban residents. This suggests that: 1) improving socio-economic conditions could significantly mitigate the health impact of air pollution; and 2) policymakers should be more cautious about policies/regulations that may transfer pollution from rich urban to poor rural areas, as the health damages of the transfer may be significantly larger for the poor rural areas.====Second, we add to a growing strand of economic research investigating the impact of air pollution on mortality in developing countries. Much of the existing evidence on the air pollution effect comes from developed countries, where the level of air pollution is far below what is observed in some very polluted developing countries such as China and India (see Graff Zivin and Neidell (2013) for a review on the economics literature).==== As the pollution-health relationship can depend on local socio-economic conditions and may possibly be non-linear (e.g., Arceo et al., 2016; Lefohn et al., 2010; Smith and Peel, 2010), our estimates are thus more relevant to more than 4 billion people in developing countries who are currently exposed to similar levels of air pollution as in China (mean daily PM==== concentration is 76 μg/m==== in our data). Additionally, we also document that the fuzzy RD estimates (which reflect the causal relationship rather than an association between air pollution and mortality) are substantially larger than OLS estimates. This implies that there may exist a severe downward bias in associational estimates which are still widely used by both governments and international agencies to establish air quality standards. This echoes a key argument made in a ==== article: approaches relying on controlling for confounding factors provide unreliable estimates of the air pollution effects and that there is a great need to re-assess the consequences of air pollution at a much larger scale (Dominici and Greenstone, 2014).====Third, in terms of the empirical setup, this paper exploits a new identification strategy embedded in China’s winter heating policy and provides a different perspective to understanding the costs of coal-fired heating. Previously, both Chen et al. (2013) and Ebenstein et al. (2017), who also studied China’s winter heating policy, focused on long-term health outcomes and compared the air pollution levels ==== caused by the policy.==== We bring the time dimension into this study and use changes in air pollution levels ==== for identification. In doing so, we complement the previous two studies by (1) confirming that winter heating policy indeed degrades air quality in China (using a different source of variation), and (2) showing that the polluted air can bring about immediate disastrous health consequences. This approach can also be used to study other short-term economic and health outcomes, such as morbidity, avoidance behavior, and absenteeism.====Finally, based on the estimates from our study we conducted an exploratory benefit-cost analysis on China’s coal replacement policy. In 2014 to deal with the severe air pollution, the Chinese government declared a “war against pollution.” Among the various initiatives that attempted to reduce air pollution, the government launched an ambitious plan that planned for phasing out coal-fired boilers, with cleaner energy substuting for coal during the winter in northern China. Following these mandates, in 2017 many places were required to replace coal with natural gas or electricity for heating. As the costs of these substitutes are higher than coal, many people in the areas affected by these substitutions were skeptical about the efficacy of the policy. Combining results of our study and estimates from multiple other sources, we show that while the ==== benefits of replacing coal with natural gas for winter heating are likely to be greater than the costs, the ==== benefits are lower than the costs. This suggests that the government policies should be “gradual” and “incremental” in substituting gas/electricity for coal, rather than implementing a “one-fit-all” policy that might engender greater resistance. Ideally, the government should start from regions that have a higher willingness to pay (frequently associated with higher incomes and development) for clean air, and then gradually extend the policy to less developed areas.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section II provides background on the winter heating system. Section III discusses the data. Section IV presents the empirical strategies. Section V summarizes the main results, conducts a battery of robustness checks, and compare our estimates with other studies. Section VI explores the heterogeneous impacts of air pollution.

Opioids have legitimate medical functions, but they are often diverted, suggesting a tradeoff between improving medical access and nonmedical abuse. We provide causal estimates of the relationship between the medical opioid supply and drug overdoses using Medicare Part D as a differential ","Drug overdose deaths have risen steadily for the past two decades and are the leading cause of death from injuries in the United States. Overdoses involving opioids have been the dominant driver of this epidemic. In 2017, opioids were involved in 47,600 overdose deaths (Scholl et al., 2019), six times the number of opioid overdoses in 1999. The current level of opioid misuse is a “public health crisis” and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) label it the “fastest growing drug problem in the United States” (CDC, 2012).====A growing economics literature evaluates mechanisms to curb the rising overdose rate such as adoption of “must access” prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) (e.g., Buchmueller and Carey, 2018), the introduction of abuse-deterrent opioids (e.g., Alpert et al., 2018), and improving access to substance abuse treatment (Swensen, 2015). Less research is dedicated to understanding the underlying causes of the opioid epidemic, which is critical information when designing policies to address this crisis. In this paper, we focus on the striking rise in opioid supply as a driving force of the sharp growth in overdoses, especially for the “first wave” of the opioid crisis, preceding the transition to heroin and fentanyl. There are three main motivations for this focus on supply and diversion. First, the role of large increases in the medical opioid supply is generally unknown. While additional access to opioids is often implicated as a potential reason for the opioid crisis (e.g., Ruhm, 2019), others have hypothesized that abuse is driving the rise in supply.==== This latter hypothesis is more consistent with the “deaths of despair” argument (Case and Deaton, 2015, Case and Deaton, 2017), suggesting that opioid supply plays a role but that the primary causes of the rise in overdoses and corresponding reductions in life expectancy are due to changes in underlying cultural and economic conditions.====Second, the United States is unique in its level of access to opioids. The United States is the largest consumer of opioid pain relievers, consuming twice as much per capita as the second largest consumer (International Narcotics Control Board, 2011). The CDC estimates that there were 82.5 opioid prescriptions per 100 people in the U.S. in 2012 and 12 states had more opioid prescriptions than people (Paulozzi et al., 2014).====Third, reduced opioid supply is not necessarily a policy goal, which differentiates opioids from drugs typically studied in the substance use literature. Unlike most drugs associated with overdose deaths and other harms, opioids remain an important medical tool which, in certain cases, are even believed to be underprescribed.==== Opioid therapy is an effective instrument for acute pain management, although the efficacy of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain is limited (Dowell et al., 2016). While these drugs have legitimate medical functions, they are also highly-addictive, prone to abuse, and frequently diverted from their intended medical use. Despite clear concurrent national trends in overdoses and medical distribution of opioids since 1999 (Bohnert et al., 2011) as well as geospatial correlations (Paulozzi and Ryan, 2006), there is little empirical evidence of the causal relationship between the increasing supply of medically-intended opioids and spillovers to the nonmedical market. Understanding the nature of this connection is critical for considering appropriate policies to address this epidemic. This paper helps fill that void.====Despite the United States’ unprecedented opioid supply, little is known about the broader non-medical spillovers caused by increasing access to opioids for medical use or the role of these spillovers in explaining the high rate of drug overdoses. What is known is that two-thirds of people who report nonmedical use of prescription pain relievers get them from a friend or relative (SAMHSA, 2015), suggesting significant scope for increases in medical opioid supply to explain proportional rises in overdoses. Khan et al. (2019) find that overdose rates increased for people without an opioid prescription when a family member received an opioid prescription. In this paper, we focus on the role of diversion in explaining national overdose trends. We study the spillovers of increasing opioid supply on a population that did not gain additional medical access to opioids. Diversion itself is difficult to measure, but we provide indirect evidence of its importance.====The economics literature has studied the abuse of illegal drugs (Becker et al., 1991, Grossman and Chaloupka, 1998, Jacobson, 2004), shocks to the supply of illegal drugs (Dobkin and Nicosia, 2009, Galenianos et al., 2012), and misuse of legal drugs (Carpenter and Dobkin, 2009, Chaloupka, 1991, Manning et al., 1989). There is surprisingly little work on negative spillovers associated with increasing medical access to prescription drugs. Despite the public health and economic importance of the opioid crisis, there is little quasi-experimental research dedicated to understanding its underlying causal mechanisms. While the crisis has recently transitioned such that illicit opioids (heroin and fentanyl) have more prominent roles, deaths involving prescription opioids remain staggering and nonmedical use of prescription opioids strongly predicts subsequent heroin use (Compton et al., 2016). This paper studies the interaction of medical drug markets with non-medical drug use. In contrast to cocaine and heroin markets, reduced opioid access is not a clear policy goal given that such actions may require diminishing access to patients with legitimate medical needs.====While research on the opioid crisis has established a host of characteristics which predict individual-level opioid abuse, few correlates have the potential to explain the dramatic rise in abuse over time. However, access to opioids has increased at levels proportional to the rise in overdoses and there is evidence of a positive correlation between opioid prescribing and opioid abuse (Dart et al., 2015, Bohnert et al., 2011). We calculate a 274% increase in medically-intended opioid distribution between 2000 and 2011 in the United States. This increase coincides with a substantial drop in the cost of opioids. Consumers paid 56% of the total costs for opioid prescriptions in 2000 and only 19% in 2011.==== Recent work calculates out-of-pocket price trends for opioids and estimates that the price of a morphine equivalent dose==== to the consumer decreased from $2.64 in 2001 to $0.54 in 2012 (Zhou et al., 2016).====The correlation between opioid supply and overdoses does not necessarily provide useful information about the causal effect of increasing supply. Areas with faster growth in opioid misuse will experience sharper increases in overdoses and that rise in misuse may drive an expansion in the state opioid supply. Alternatively, physicians may be less prone to overprescribe in states with high rates of opioid diversion,==== suggesting the fast growth in opioid supply is associated with slower growth in misuse. The direction of bias is unknown.====We exploit large and differential geographic changes in opioid supply caused by the implementation of the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Program (“Part D”) in 2006, a prescription drug insurance expansion targeting older segments of the population. Part D provides voluntary outpatient prescription drug coverage to millions of Medicare beneficiaries. Several studies have shown that passage of Part D increased access and utilization of prescription drugs among the elderly (Duggan and Morton, 2010, Duggan and Morton, 2011, Zhang et al., 2009, Ketcham and Simon, 2008).====At a more aggregate level, this expansion differentially affected states based on the proportion of the population eligible for Medicare. States with a relatively large fraction of individuals gaining prescription drug coverage due to Part D experienced a relative increase in opioid supply. The resulting shifts in opioid supply are large and mimic the national growth in opioid access. This has the potential to affect the Medicare-ineligible population if a primary access point is either (1) elderly relatives or friends with multiple concurrent opioid prescriptions, or (2) diverted opioids from medical facilities, pain clinics, and pharmacies that care for elderly patients. While the elderly have a modest rate of unintentional opioid overdose deaths (Paulozzi et al., 2011), they are the legitimate medical users of more opioid prescriptions than any other age group (Volkow et al., 2011), which makes studying an insurance expansion targeting older age groups ideal.====We leverage the differential effects of the implementation of Part D on states based on pre-Part D variation in elderly shares. Our approach permits us to account for national effects associated with Part D and other secular trends while also controlling for fixed differences across states. Drawing on evidence presented below that states with higher elderly shares have higher Part D enrollment and that enrollment in Part D increased the amount of opioids prescribed to individuals 65 years and older, we test whether the overall supply of opioids increased disproportionately in high elderly share states. Once we establish that the medical distribution of opioids is higher to states with a higher elderly share after implementation of Part D, we examine whether this differential increase in opioid supply led to disparate growth in opioid abuse rates among the under-65 population as measured by overdose deaths and using a complementary measure of opioid substance abuse treatment admissions. Part D also potentially affected prescription drug access for the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) population since SSDI beneficiaries are eligible for Medicare, but we show that our results are not driven by systematic behavioral changes among under-65 individuals covered by Medicare.====We assess the differential impact of Part D on under-65 opioid-related treatment admissions and overdose deaths. We find significant effects on both outcomes and there is no evidence of differential pre-existing trends. Our estimates imply that a 10% increase in medical access to opioids leads to a 7.1% increase in opioid-related mortality and a 9.6% increase in opioid-involved treatment admissions among the under-65 population. We do not find corresponding evidence that opioid prescriptions increased among the under-65 population disproportionately in high elderly share states, consistent with diversion as the driving mechanism and ruling out alternative mechanisms such as physician prescribing spillovers or systematically related changes in opioid access for the SSDI population. While our measure of diversion is indirect, we consider a wide range of alternative causal pathways but the evidence strongly suggests that Part D increased opioid abuse among the under-65, non-SSDI population through diversion. Extrapolating our results to the full 2000-2011 time series, our evidence suggests that 74% of the dramatic growth in opioid-related overdose deaths over this time period can be attributed to spillovers resulting from increased medical access. We conclude that diversion has played a key role in the opioid crisis.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide background on Medicare Part D, detail the data that we use to estimate our models, and discuss our underlying theoretical framework. Section 3 describes our empirical approach. We present results in Section 4. In Section 5, we discuss interpretation of the findings.

Using independent survey measures of informal ==== and care receipt over the past two decades, we find that informal care from adult children to their elderly parents is countercyclical. By contrast, informal care from spouses is procyclical among individuals in their sixties. We find little corresponding change in the use of formal care, highlighting the potential for unmet care needs across the business cycle. These findings suggest that informal health inputs may play an important role in the interpretation of the cyclicality of elderly mortality.","A large literature demonstrates that mortality is sensitive to macroeconomic conditions (see Ruhm, 2012, Ruhm, 2015 for reviews). Among several posited mechanisms driving this relationship, the role of health care inputs has emerged as an important channel. This channel may be particularly relevant for the elderly, whose health and mortality is more directly dependent on healthcare inputs. Studies have shown that specific healthcare inputs, including nursing home quality, nursing home and hospital staffing, and the willingness of providers to accept Medicare patients, exhibit cyclical patterns, which may translate directly to elderly mortality (Stevens et al., 2015, Konetzka et al., 2018, McInerney and Mellor, 2012, Antwi and Bowblis, 2018). These estimates, however, concentrate on inputs from the ==== healthcare system. In this paper, we explore the cyclicality of an often overlooked input into elderly health and well-being: ==== long-term care.====The need for long-term care is a reality of aging: recent estimates suggest that 70% of 65 year olds in the United States will require assistance with basic functions at some point in their life (Hagen, 2013). While many individuals receive long-term care through formal channels such as nursing homes or paid in-home care, over half of long-term care is provided informally by family and friends. However, many informal caregivers are working-age children and spouses who face heavy demands on their time, and informal caregiving can come with significant opportunity costs (Fahle and McGarry, 2017, Van Houtven et al., 2013, Ettner, 1996, Maestas and Truskinovsky, 2018). Given the scale of informal care and its potential interaction with the large and rapidly growing formal market for long-term care, it is important to understand if and how this key health input fluctuates with macroeconomic conditions.====To investigate the cyclicality of informal care, we examine the effect of business cycles on the supply of informal caregiving and on the composition of long-term care received by the elderly. Business cycles may affect informal care directly by changing the time cost of providing care, as wages and employment opportunities increase when the economy expands. With more time in the labor force (and thus a higher opportunity cost of time), individuals have less time to devote to caring for their loved ones. However, economic fluctuations can also affect the amount of informal caregiving through a number of other channels. First, business cycles may affect household wealth, which could impact the affordability of different long-term care options. For instance, exogenous increases in elderly income have been shown to induce the elderly to shift away from informal care and nursing homes towards formal in-home care (Goda et al., 2011, Tsai, 2015). On the other hand, ==== in elderly income have also been shown to push caregiving spouses nearing retirement age back into the labor market (Fadlon and Nielsen, 2017). Second, business cycles may affect the supply of formal care through the price of formal care: if formal care becomes more costly during an expansion due to, for example, increased labor costs of formal care workers or fewer nursing home beds, an individual may turn to family or friends for care instead. Finally, business cycles may impact the supply of formal care not only through the price but also the quality of formal care. If the quality of the workforce in nursing homes or in other professional direct care occupations declines during an expansion, individuals may prefer to receive care from family at home (Konetzka et al., 2018, Cawley et al., 2006, Antwi and Bowblis, 2018). While the opportunity cost of time channel suggests that the supply of informal care should unambiguously decrease during economic expansions, the resource channel suggests that the effect may vary, and the price and quality of formal care channels suggest that informal caregiving should instead increase. The overall effect of business cycles on informal care is thus an empirical question.====To identify the effect of business cycles on informal care and other long-term care outcomes, we exploit annual variation in economic conditions (the unemployment rate) across states and over time. In our main analysis, we use the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) from 2003 through 2015 to examine the cyclicality of the ==== of informal care and the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) from 1995 through 2012 to examine the cyclicality of the ==== of informal care. We consider the nature of the care that responds to the business cycle by looking separately at help with Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), which includes help with physical limitations such as bathing, getting out of bed, and feeding, and help with Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs), which includes help with transportation, grocery shopping, preparing meals, home maintenance, and taking medication. To understand the channels through which macroeconomic conditions affect informal care, we also examine heterogeneity by age, caregiver relationship, education, marital status, and gender, and additionally examine the effects of macroeconomic conditions on employment and retirement outcomes of potential caregivers. Finally, we use the HRS and other data sources to consider how the demand for formal care and health outcomes respond to economic conditions.====We find that informal caregiving is countercyclical. A one percentage point increase in the unemployment rate increases the overall probability of providing informal care by 0.8 percentage points from a base of 13%. This pattern is largely driven by less educated, male caregivers, whose employment opportunities were more affected by recent downturns than other demographic groups (Hoynes et al., 2012). Consistent with the opportunity cost of time channel, much of this effect is driven by care provided on weekdays. We find that this overall caregiving result is mirrored by an increase in the likelihood of ==== informal care among a relatively older sample, but not a relatively younger sample, of the elderly: a one percentage point increase in the unemployment rate increases the likelihood of receiving informal care by 0.5 percentage points for individuals 70 and over (from a base of 18%), while it ==== the likelihood of receiving informal care by 0.8 percentage points for individuals 60–69 (from a base of 9%). For the older sample, this effect is concentrated in an increase in care from adult children, while for the relatively younger sample this effect is concentrated in a decrease in care from spouses, consistent with a resource channel. These opportunity cost and resource channels are corroborated by procyclical employment effects of adult children and, conversely, countercyclical employment effects for spouses of 60–69 year olds, possibly driven by impacts on household resources. In all samples, the margin of informal care that is most sensitive to these economic fluctuations is help with IADLs, a less time-sensitive category of caregiving. We find little evidence that these changes in informal care are offset by, or possibly driven by, concurrent changes in the use of formal long-term care, or changes in health outcomes.====We show that a simple conceptual model of long-term care and family labor supply can generate comparative statics in line with our main results. In our model, an elderly individual uses long-term care and can either receive it on the formal market or informally from her adult child or working-age spouse. Each type of care is characterized by its quality and its price, which is an explicit market price for formal care and an implicit opportunity cost for informal care. We show that in this model, informal care hours are a function of the potential caregiver's wage, the quality of formal care, the price of formal care, and family resources. When economic expansions increase the potential caregiver's wage but not the other parameters of the model, informal care decreases. When economic expansions additionally affect family resources or the price or quality of formal care, the effect on informal care becomes ambiguous.====This paper makes three main contributions. First, our finding that informal care for those age 70 and over is largely countercyclical suggests an additional explanation for the effects of aggregate unemployment rates on health that is distinct from the effects of ==== unemployment on health (Ruhm, 2000, Stevens et al., 2015).==== Stevens et al. (2015) show that the increased mortality during economic booms for the period 1976–2006 is concentrated among elderly women and nursing home residents, and argue that the countercyclical quality of health care in nursing homes make nursing home residents particularly susceptible to these fluctuations.==== While showing a direct link between informal care and mortality is outside the scope of this paper, our results suggest that the availability of informal care (or lack thereof) may be an additional and complementary mechanism for this empirical relationship and point to broader consequences of the elasticity of informal care for elderly well-being.====Second, we provide new evidence on the link between labor supply and informal caregiving by showing that ====economic conditions, either through directly affecting one's employment opportunities, or through alternative feedback mechanisms (such as wealth effects or quality of care effects), alter informal caregiving decisions. Our results expand on a literature that finds a negative relationship between ==== labor supply opportunities and informal caregiving (Bolin et al., 2008, Van Houtven et al., 2013, He and McHenry, 2016, Fahle and McGarry, 2017). This literature uses a variety of instruments – often related to family characteristics – to deal with the endogeneity of individual caregiving decisions and labor supply decisions (e.g., Carmichael et al., 2010); our study, on the other hand, focuses on macroeconomic phenomena that are plausibly exogenous to individual choices. Our emphasis on macroeconomic conditions reveals results distinct from the existing literature because macroeconomic conditions can affect informal caregiving in ways other than through one's own labor market changes (as our conceptual framework formalizes).====More closely related to our paper, Costa-Font et al. (2016) find that the Great Recession in Europe significantly increased the availability of informal care, particularly from informal caregivers outside the household.==== Their focus is cross-country variation in the severity of unemployment changes during the Great Recession in Europe, and its effects on informal care receipt among individuals over 50. Our paper also finds countercyclical informal care receipt, and expands on these findings by examining the effect of more general labor market fluctuations (not only the Great Recession) within the United States on a more extensive set of outcomes, including informal care provision, informal care receipt, the relationship of the caregiver, and the use of formal care. Furthermore, we provide a conceptual framework to interpret these macro-driven effects.====Finally, our paper contributes new evidence to the literature on time use and caregiving. Studies that focus on another major type source of “informal” care – childcare – typically find that the elasticity of time dedicated to childcare is low (Kimmel and Connelly, 2007, Guryan et al., 2008). In contrast, our findings suggest that caring for other adults is much more elastic, particularly for care for IADLs. In addition, this paper uses the best data available to measure informal care and is one of the first to use time use diary data from the ATUS as a measure of the supply of informal long-term care. Our similar findings from the HRS, a survey designed specifically to measure informal care receipt, allows us to compare and, ultimately, validate the ATUS as a meaningful measure of informal caregiving.====In the next section, we briefly review long-term care in the United States, and Section 3 proposes a simple model for understanding the various margins of adjustment of long-term care to business cycles. Section 4 describes our data and methodology. Section 5 presents our results on the cyclicality of the provision and receipt of informal care and explores mechanisms including employment responses, while Section 6 presents the effects on the use of formal care and on the health of the elderly. We conclude in Section 7.",The cyclicality of informal care,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629619309397,26 February 2020,2020,Research Article,239.0
Capatina Elena,"Research School of Economics, HW Arndt Building 25A, College of Business and Economics, The Australian National University, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia","Received 6 September 2017, Revised 7 February 2020, Accepted 19 February 2020, Available online 24 February 2020, Version of Record 6 March 2020.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2020.102305,Cited by (0),This paper examines the extensive margin of selection into employer-sponsored ,"Employer sponsored health insurance (ESHI) is the primary source of health insurance for working age individuals in the United States. But in 2010, 19.2% of workers were not covered by private health insurance. This fraction was higher among workers aged 25–40, equal to 24.4%. The general belief was that adverse selection led to a relatively large fraction of young, healthy and uninsured individuals.====Testing for risk selection in ESHI is very difficult since it is not possible to distinguish between workers who desire ESHI but cannot obtain a job that offers it, and those who do not desire it and optimally sort into jobs not offering ESHI where wages might be higher.==== However, the uninsured group also contains a third type of workers who in fact decline ESHI offers. Very little research exists on this group despite it being easily identifiable using survey data and significant in size: 8% of eligible employees aged 25–40 did not enroll in ESHI and remained privately uninsured, accounting for 24% of privately uninsured workers, and for 19% of privately uninsured individuals in this age group.====This paper fills this gap in the literature by studying the extensive margin of selection in health insurance focusing exclusively on workers who are offered ESHI by their own employer. The main question is whether workers who decline ESHI and remain privately uninsured are significantly higher or lower risk than those who take up ESHI, conditional on insurance costs and the types of health plans offered by employers. While a vast literature has studied the link between health risk and ESHI plan choice conditional on ESHI take up, this paper is the first to study risk selection in the take-up decision itself.====I use the Medical Expenditures Panel Survey (MEPS) and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth’97 (NLSY97), which allow me to identify employees who were offered ESHI but refused it. The main analysis of the paper is conducted using pre-ACA data from 2001 to 2010, and a separate section analyses the post-ACA period 2014–2016.====I study both ==== and ==== selection, examining the relationships between insurance take-up and general health in the same period, risky health behaviors, and medical expenditures. ==== adverse selection predicts that those who are higher risk are more likely to take up ESHI, everything else equal (Rothschild and Stiglitz, 1976, Wilson, 1977). Moral hazard predicts that those covered by ESHI are more likely to engage in risky health behaviors and have higher demand for medical care due to lower prices. Together, these forces predict a positive correlation between insurance coverage and ==== losses (i.e., medical expenditures) (e.g., Chiappori and Salanie, 2000, Finkelstein and McGarry, 2006, Fang et al., 2008, Fang and Wu, 2016).====Testing for selection requires that we compare workers who accept and reject ESHI, conditioning on ESHI premiums and health plans offered. Since these characteristics are not available in the MEPS nor the NLSY97, a crucial part of the analysis is finding suitable proxies. The most important determinants of ESHI out-of-pocket premiums and plan types are individual wages and firm and job characteristics. Fortunately both data sets contain comprehensive sets of variables describing these (e.g., firm size, occupation, industry, hourly wages, hours worked, region and union status).====First, I find that conditional on an extensive list of individual, firm and job characteristics, workers who decline coverage are in significantly worse health than those who take up ESHI among those aged 25–40 in the pre-ACA period. There is no correlation between ESHI take-up and health among older workers aged 41–64. Young workers who take up ESHI also have better health behaviors (i.e., smoking, diet, and sleep) than decliners, indicating overall lower health risk.====Second, I find that those who take up ESHI receive more basic preventive care and have higher total medical expenditures despite having lower health risk ====. These results are consistent with a combination of advantageous selection and ==== moral hazard. Workers who take up ESHI invest more in their health and could demand more preventive care all else equal, leading to higher expenditures. ==== moral hazard works in the same direction since insurance lowers the price of care, increasing utilization.====I build a theoretical framework and explore three main channels that could explain the negative correlation between health risk and ESHI take-up among young workers: (1) differences in demand due to income, where health risk and income are negatively correlated, (2) differences in preferences (e.g., risk aversion negatively correlated with health risk), and (3) Medicaid crowding out ESHI.====Individuals with higher incomes (who are also healthier on average) are more likely to take up ESHI for several reasons. First, due to concavity in preferences over consumption, the utility cost of paying the ESHI premium is lower at high income levels. Second, ESHI premiums can be both income and payroll tax deductible. Those in higher marginal income tax brackets receive a larger tax break due to the progressive income tax code in the U.S. (Jeske and Kitao, 2009). Third, high income workers could be working for better firms that offer more generous ESHI plans at lower costs.====I find that high income groups are indeed lower risk and significantly more likely to take up ESHI. Education (a measure of permanent income), demographics (e.g., household size that affect income per person) and family income account for approximately half of the negative correlation between ESHI take-up and health risk among workers aged 25–40. But the association remains negative and statistically significant revealing that ==== advantageous selection is not entirely explained by the income elasticity of insurance demand or by tax incentives. Only in the 41–50 age group, the association between ESHI take-up and health risk turns positive once controlling for income variables.====Next, risk aversion has been emphasized in previous literature as a key advantageous characteristic, being linked with higher demand for insurance and more precautionary actions that reduce risk (David de Meza, 2001). Using the NLSY97 which contains self-elicited context specific risk preferences, I find that preferences for health risk contribute to advantageous selection, although their contribution is quantitatively very small. Preferences for financial risk are not significantly associated with ESHI take-up.====Lastly, I find that Medicaid crowds out ESHI for low socio-economic status (SES) workers. This plays a crucial role in risk selection since low SES groups have the highest health risk. If we exclude workers covered by public health insurance from the analysis, the negative correlation between ESHI take-up and health risk among young workers is reduced by approximately a quarter. In addition, ESHI decliners who remain completely uninsured have higher probabilities of transitioning to non-employment and receiving Medicaid a year later. This suggests that Medicaid crowds out ESHI demand not only for those who already qualify, but also for those who anticipate to receive it in the future.====Finally, I study how risk selection in ESHI changed with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. The ACA's key provisions are (i) the employer mandate which requires firms with 50+ employees to offer ESHI or pay a tax penalty; (ii) the individual mandate which requires individuals to buy health insurance or pay a fine; (iii) insurance exchanges where uninsured individuals can buy insurance at group-based premium rates with subsidies for those with low incomes; and (iv) the expansion of Medicaid to a higher income eligibility threshold. These provisions came into effect gradually, with most taking effect on January 1, 2014 (e.g., the Medicaid expansion).====Using the MEPS from 2014 to 2016, I find that the fraction of workers who reject ESHI and remain privately uninsured and their average risk have in fact remained unchanged relative to the pre-ACA period. While the Medicaid expansion could amplify the crowding out effect on ESHI for low SES/high risk workers, the individual mandate largely counteracted this by raising the cost of being privately uninsured.",Selection in employer sponsored health insurance,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629617308287,24 February 2020,2020,Research Article,240.0

A growing literature shows that conditions during gestation and early childhood explain health inequalities in prime-age adults, and that investment before age 5 has large payoffs for future health (Currie and Almond, 2011, Heckman and Kautz, 2014, Adhvaryu et al., 2019). In contrast, adolescent and adult programs have not been found to be as effective as programs that target earlier ages, partly due to the evaluations’ short-term follow-ups and participants’ selection into the program (Heckman and Mosso, 2014). It is therefore important to document long-run impacts and also to examine the distribution of the effects in a population when selection on gains may exist.====In this paper, we use a regression discontinuity design to study a large-scale rustication program in 1960s China and investigate the impact on the “sent-down” youths’ long-term health. Specifically, employing survey data from 2010, we are able to examine the rusticated individuals’ physical and mental health conditions 40 years after the experience for long-term follow-up. Moreover, by applying the marginal treatment effect (MTE) generalized by Heckman and Vytlacil, 1999, Heckman and Vytlacil, 2005, Heckman and Vytlacil, 2007, we show how the effect differs across individuals’ observed and unobserved characteristics, and produce the full distribution of treatment effects to go beyond the local average treatment effects (LATE) obtained from a fuzzy RD design.====In December 1968, the then-leader of China, Mao Zedong, initiated a national movement to send 17 million junior and senior high school students in the cities to rural areas. Eligible urban youths were suddenly exiled to the countryside and experienced a dramatic change in living environment; specifically, a lower standard of living, strenuous physical labor, and lack of cultural and social activities. They were estranged from their families for years, and were compelled to perform hard labor every day.====This unexpected and mandatory movement provides a regression discontinuity (RD) design to estimate the impact of teenage adversity on long-term health. Starting in 1968, the scheme applied to all eligible urban individuals who would graduate from junior or senior high school. The first sent-down cohort was the cutoff for being sent down: The cohort born just after September 1946 was forced to be rusticated, whereas the cohort born just before September 1946 was not subject to the mandate and therefore constitutes a good counterfactual. Both anecdotal evidence and quantitative exercises (i.e., density check and balancing tests of predetermined characteristics) support that individuals did not manipulate their birth timing to avoid being sent down, which is the key identifying assumption of our RD estimation.====Examining a wide range of physical and mental health indicators, we find that sent-down youths have worse mental health conditions: The likelihood of having mental disorders is about 1.09 standard deviations higher than their non-sent-down counterparts. On the other hand, we do not find a strong effect on physical health: The likelihood of having unhealthy physical symptoms is around 0.07 standard deviations lower and the effect is not statistically significant. These results are robust to a battery of robustness checks, including alternative RD specifications, alternative measure of exposure (send-down duration) and health outcomes, RD-DD estimators that control for cohort effect using a rural population, controlling for city violence during the Cultural Revolution, and testing the general equilibrium effect on the untreated.====Our fuzzy RD estimates identify the local average treatment effect (LATE), which reflects the average treatment effect on the send-down compliers in the cutoff cohort. If the effect varies across individuals, the LATE may not be globally externally valid. To assess the effects on populations other than the compliers and the distributional effects, we apply the framework of Brinch et al. (2017) and Kowalski (2016) to estimate the MTE. Our findings show strong treatment effect heterogeneity and selection on gains. For instance, youths with more siblings are more likely to be sent down but experience smaller adverse effects on health outcomes. Selection on unobserved characteristics reinforces this finding: Youths with unobserved characteristics that tend to incur larger costs from being sent down also suffered more health problems. Using MTE to calculate the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) and average treatment effect (ATE), we consistently find adverse effects on mental health, while the impact on physical health is either close to zero or statistically not significant.====The adverse effects on mental health are consistent with social psychology theories on adolescent experience. Adolescence and early adulthood is a period of great mental plasticity, during which noncognitive and personality skills are formed, developed, and shaped by experience (Alwin and Krosnick, 1991). Hardships in the countryside and separation from family are crucial for sent-down youths’ mental conditions and long-term development. In addition to the contemporaneous shocks, the effects of this adversity may still be felt many years later—in our context, 40 years.====We also test the importance of various subsequent pathways after send-down—educational attainment, income, marriage, and childbearing—that may lead to long-term health outcomes. By estimating the effect of send-down on several indicators of socioeconomic status, we do not find evidence that the send-down experience affects the individual's education attainment or labor market outcomes. It is unlikely that the adverse effects on long-term health conditions are primarily driven by these post-send-down life events.====This paper contributes to the literature on the relationship between teenage conditions and later life well-being. Heckman (2000) suggests that early investments in human capital for children have a large payoff. A great number of studies evaluate programs that target early childhood, such as policies to extend maternity leave (Tanaka, 2005, Carneiro et al., 2015, Rasmussen, 2010, Dustmann and Schönberg, 2012); Head Start which provides health and other social services to poor children ages 3 to 5 (Currie and Thomas, 1995, Garces et al., 2002, Ludwig and Miller, 2007); the Moving to Opportunities (MTO) program, which moves low-income families to better residential neighborhoods (Katz et al., 2001, Ludwig et al., 2001, Ludwig et al., 2011, Ludwig et al., 2012, Ludwig et al., 2013, Kling et al., 2005, Kling et al., 2007, Sanbonmatsu et al., 2006; Chetty et al., 2016; etc.); health insurance programs for children, including Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (Currie et al., 2008; Wherry and Meyer, 2016; Miller and Wherry, 2019; Cohodes et al., 2016; Deshpande, 2016; Boudreaux et al., 2016; Wherry et al., 2018; Goodman-Bacon, 2018; Brown et al., 2017; etc.); the Food Stamp Program (Hoynes et al., 2016); and the deworming program (Baird et al., 2016). Another line of literature examines exogenous conditions and unusual shocks, such as pollution or disease breakouts at the fetal stage (Currie, 2011, Almond, 2006)====; environmental factors and economic circumstance at birth (Maccini and Yang, 2009, Adhvaryu et al., 2019); the loss of a parent (Adda et al., 2011); extreme drought and civil war (Alderman et al., 2006); and famine (Meng and Qian, 2009).====Our study has two major novelties compared the previous research: long-term follow-up and extending from LATE to distributional effects. First, evaluations of programs that target teenagers usually follow participants for no longer than 20 years. Short-term follow-up could lead to biased estimates of returns—upward-biased if the benefits eventually dissipate or downward-biased if the effects take place later in life (Heckman and Mosso, 2014). In contrast, our measures of health outcomes were collected about 40 years after the individuals experienced the shock, thereby revealing the long-lasting impact of teenage conditions. Gould et al. (2011), the study closest to ours in terms of long-term follow-ups, examines Operation Magic Carpet, in which Yemenite children were airlifted to Israel, and document the impact over their life cycle. We further innovate by employing an identification strategy closer to a randomized experiment. Second, we move beyond the commonly discussed LATE and estimate ATT and ATE from MTE of the send-down experience. This allows us to examine distributional effects and understand the external validity of the estimated treatment effects.====An increasing body of literature from epidemiology, public health, demography, and psychology studies the relationship between early-life exposure and health outcomes later in life (see, for instance, Carr, 2019, Cohen et al., 2010, and Zimmer et al., 2016 for reviews). The early-life conditions that are commonly studied include childhood socioeconomic status (SES; e.g., parental unemployment); psychosocial stressors (e.g., child mistreatment); contextual factors (e.g., neighbourhood conditions); special experiences (e.g., military exposures); etc. More relevant to this paper, the association between low SES in early life and health outcomes reveals four possible mechanisms as classified by Pudrovska and Anikputa (2014): the critical stage model, the accumulation of risk model, the pathway model, and the social mobility model. The critical stage model, which reflects a mechanism of biological imprint, is supported by findings that early-life SES has stronger power than adult SES in explaining mental health (Angelini et al., 2008) and cardiovascular risk (Murray et al., 2011). The accumulation of risk model suggests that rather than exposure at a particular stage, it is the accumulated damage that causes health consequences (Kahn and Pearlin, 2006). The pathway model moves beyond the direct effects from early-life exposure and emphasizes the pathways—such as SES in adulthood (Montez et al., 2009); life style (Ford et al., 2011); and health behavior—and later health outcomes. The social mobility model predicts that later life experience can moderate or reverse the impact of early exposure, an view opposite to the critical stage hypothesis. Our findings are more consistent with the critical stage model, in that the rustication experience during teen years shows persistent effects on long-run mental health, in the absence of evidence on pathways (e.g., later life events).====This paper is also related to the literature on the origins of health inequalities. In addition to studies of early-life conditions (Currie et al., 2010), one strand of literature focuses on how socioeconomic status and conditions affect noncognitive development and health conditions. Adams et al. (2003) and Adda et al. (2003) find that socioeconomic status appears to have stronger links with mental and chronic illnesses than with acute and sudden-onset health conditions. Adda et al. (2009), Fiorini and Keane (2013) and Cornaglia et al. (2014) identify the effect on health of income shocks, children's activities, and crime, respectively. There is also a well-established correlation between health and education (Grossman, 2006, Cutler and Lleras-Muney, 2010, Clark and Royer, 2013).====We also make a useful contribution to the literature on the effect of the send-down movement. Li et al. (2010) use twin data and find that rusticated individuals did not have worse—and, in some cases, had better—outcomes for health, earnings, career, and social status. Meng and Gregory (2002) and Zhou (2013) find that sent-down individuals were more likely to upgrade their education after returning to the city. Gong et al. (2018) show that the send-down experience rendered individuals less likely to believe in external factors such as luck, fate, or powerful others. Our paper complements these studies by investigating the impact of the send-down experience on long-run physical and mental health outcomes.",The average and distributional effects of teenage adversity on long-term health,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629619304989,12 February 2020,2020,Research Article,241.0

Positive online information, however, had strong impacts on vaccination decisions, suggesting that online dissemination of vaccine-safety information may help tackle the sticky misinformation.","Mass media health information, especially in the form of information campaigns which oftentimes convey a homogeneous message, has been documented to be successful in effecting desirable changes in health behavior.==== Less is known about the effects, however, when the media presents mixed or even conflicting health information to the public. A case in point is the media coverage on the safety of the measles–mumps–rubella (MMR) vaccine. Psychologists have documented in the laboratory that, when presented with ambiguous or mixed evidence, people tend to select and interpret information in a way that confirms their existing positions, a tendency termed ==== (e.g., Oskamp, 1965, Darley and Gross, 1983). In this paper, we utilize the controversy over the link between the MMR vaccine and autism as a natural experiment to investigate how health decisions respond to mixed information and whether there is evidence that they are affected by confirmatory bias.====The MMR-autism controversy was initiated by Wakefield et al. (1998). Based on a self-selected sample of 12 children, the study claimed to have found a connection between the measles virus and the inflammatory bowel disease found in autistic children. The connection was somehow promoted as an evidence linking the MMR vaccine to the risk of developing autism. A substantial body of subsequent studies based on more rigorous research protocols and larger samples consistently reached an opposite conclusion (e.g., Taylor et al., 1999, Madsen et al., 2002). In 2004, based on a systematic review of research studies, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) issued its final report concluding that no convincing evidence exists for the casual MMR-autism link.==== In the same year, Wakefield et al. (1998) was partially retracted, followed by a complete retraction in 2010 in which the journal's editor noted that “it was utterly clear, without any ambiguity at all, that the statements in the paper were utterly false.” While by 2004 the issue was beyond debate in the scientific community, the public was still presented with conflicting messages, ranging from celebrities’ anti-vaccination speeches to emotional stories from parents of autistic children to assurances of vaccine safety from authorities.====Fig. 1 presents, for the period 1998–2011, the annual proportion of children between 19 and 35 months of age whose immunization records indicated delay in the MMR immunization. The percentage, which represents our outcome variable, the ====, increased after Wakefield et al. (1998) was published. It went back down as studies disapproving the MMR-autism link were accumulating. Interestingly, the rate climbed back up drastically after 2004, the year when the IOM issued its final report and when the public began to receive increasingly more mixed information about the safety of the vaccine.====Prior studies using UK data indicated that more educated parents held stronger biases against the vaccine. The increase in the MMR vaccine non-uptake rate in the UK in response to Wakefield et al. (1998), from 1997 up to 2005, was found to be driven by children of more educated parents (e.g., Wright and Polack, 2006, Anderberg et al., 2011). A contemporaneous study by Chang (2018), which covered the period from 1995 to 2006, documented a similar educational gap in the US. Using 1998 as the base year, we evaluate annual changes in the MMR vaccine non-uptake rate in the US till 2011, dividing the sample by the college-education status of the mother. As the starting point of our principal investigation, we find that the educational gap in the US was persistent and became even wider after the periods covered by these other studies. The finding suggests that the biases held by the more educated US mothers against the vaccine did not subside—in fact strengthened—after consensus was reached in the scientific community that the vaccine does not cause autism.====We estimate the differential time trend of the MMR vaccine non-uptake rate of the college-educated group. Interpreting the differential trend as measuring the strength of the educated mothers’ biases, we investigate how exposures to information with different positions about the safety of the vaccine influence the biases. Our identification strategy exploits state-year variations in a set of active and passive exposures to broadly defined media information. We measure active exposures by the search intensity indexes of related topics obtained from Google Trends. For passive exposures, we manually review and classify relevant newspaper coverage retrieved from LexisNexis Academic and collect reported incidences of autism and MMR from the Office of Special Education Programs and the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. We classify all information exposures in our sample into positive, ones that encourage immunization, and negative, ones that discourage immunization.====Our main finding is the substantial asymmetry in the responses to positive and negative information about the MMR vaccine. A one-standard-deviation increase in exposures to negative information strengthened the biases of the college-educated mothers by more than 35%; by contrast, a one-standard-deviation increase in exposures to positive information attenuated the biases by no more than 10%. The college-educated group responded more strongly to information consistent with their biases against the vaccine (e.g., news reports of unexplained increase in autism cases) than to information that is in opposition to the biases (e.g., reports citing the conclusion reached by the IOM). The finding provides population-level evidence of confirmatory bias at work in the rising trend of the MMR vaccine non-uptake rate in the US.====Our study contributes to the literature on education gradients that are observed in a variety of health outcomes (e.g., Currie and Moretti, 2003, Lleras-Muney, 2005, de Walque, 2007, Cutler and Lleras-Muney, 2010). The study that is closest to ours in this literature is Chang (2018). We both documented an extended educational gap in the US in the responses to the MMR-autism controversy, partially corroborating the previous UK findings.==== Chang (2018) also studied the impacts of the media, focusing on newspapers, radio, and television. She found that the educational gap increased with greater media attention to the controversy. We differ in a number of ways. Some of the less crucial differences are the longer periods we cover and our different media data, which include traditional newspaper coverage as well as online searches. With online information becoming an indispensable source of information for many people, our inclusion of this type of media provides a fuller picture of the information that may influence vaccination decisions.====The primary difference between the two studies, however, lies in the different questions addressed. While Chang (2018) did not distinguish between positive and negative media coverage, our principal inquiry concerns the different impacts of information with alternative positions about the MMR vaccine. A common explanation for health-related education gradients is that education allows more effective absorptions of medical information, which are reflected in health behavior (Grossman, 1972). Our findings point to a downside associated with this better ability to absorb information: the initially absorbed information may hinder subsequent absorptions of more up-to-date and accurate information in the presence of cognitive biases. Our finding on the asymmetric responses to information suggests that the persistent decline in the MMR immunization of the more educated group, even after the vaccine has been proved safe, may be a consequence of this effect. While Chang (2018) left the educational gap as a puzzle and discuss possible explanations, we provide a theoretical model and empirical evidence pointing to asymmetric responses to information, as would be driven by confirmatory bias, as a plausible culprit.====This brings us to another contribution of our study. While laboratory evidence documents the existence of confirmatory bias, few studies have examined such biases in a real-world setting. To the best of our knowledge, our study presents the first naturally occurring evidence consistent with the presence of confirmatory bias in health decisions.====Our study also contributes a policy suggestion for what may be an effective channel to counter the misinformation surrounding the MMR vaccine and for correct information to take root. We find that among the different types of information considered online information has the strongest impact on vaccination decisions, and this is true not only for negative information but also for positive information. The finding suggests that online dissemination of vaccine-safety information may be an effective way to tackle the adverse consequences of the previously circulated misinformation that lingered under the documented biases.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides a more detailed account of the MMR-autism controversy, bringing to view the prevalence of mixed information during the period. Section 3 describes the data and the sample. Section 4 examines the differential trend of the MMR vaccine non-uptake rates between children of college-educated and non-college-educated mothers. The trend analysis establishes the biases held by the more educated group against the vaccine.

The estimated effects are increasing in avoidance distance to the point that a confidential abortion is more than a day's drive away, and also are substantially larger in the poorest quartile of counties.","Since the landmark ==== v. ==== ruling in 1973, the Supreme Court has repeatedly grappled with the question of what regulations states can impose on abortion patients and providers. Two subsequent rulings, generally considered landmarks in their own right, provide additional guidance on this question. In ==== v. ==== (1992) the Supreme Court crafted the undue burden standard, declaring that “an undue burden exists and therefore a provision of law is invalid if its purpose or effect is to place substantial obstacles in the path of a woman seeking an abortion.” In ==== v. ==== (2016) the Court reaffirmed and clarified the evaluation of undue burden, emphasizing the long distances that Texas women had to travel to obtain abortions after the closures of more than half the clinics in that state.====The laws considered by the Court in ==== and ==== illustrate the shifting tactics of abortion opponents in the decades since ====, from demand-side regulations aimed at the women seeking abortions to supply-side regulations aimed at providers. In ====, the Court ruled that a Texas law that had shuttered more than half the clinics in the state imposed an undue burden by increasing travel distances to a decreasing number of clinics. Nearly 25 years earlier in ====, however, the Court had largely upheld demand-side regulations in Pennsylvania, including a parental consent requirement for minors seeking abortions, declaring that they did not impose an undue burden.====This conclusion might further be supported by two previous empirical studies using national data and difference-in-difference research designs. Both provide credible evidence that parental involvement laws – a term that encompasses both parental consent and parental notification requirements – had little if any effect on teen births in the 1980s and early 1990s (Kane and Staiger, 1996, Levine, 2003). One explanation for this finding may be that teens practiced safer sex in response to parental involvement laws. Another is that the laws had no teeth, and teens continued to obtain abortions at roughly similar rates, either choosing to involve a parent or traveling to a nearby state to avoid the law.====The first contribution of this paper is observe that the decades since ==== and this earlier empirical work have brought dramatic increases in the distances minors must travel to obtain a “confidential abortion,” by which we mean an abortion without involving a parent or obtaining a judicial bypass. To document this trend, we combine an updated panel of legal coding for parental involvement laws with a newly-assembled panel of abortion provider locations to estimate county-level travel distance to obtain a confidential abortion. Fig. 1 illustrates spatial variation in teens’ access to abortion in 1992 and 2016. In 1992, 20 states were enforcing parental involvement laws. But these states were fairly geographically dispersed, and 91 percent of all minors in the United States lived within 200 miles of a confidential abortion provider. In the intervening years, 15 more states began enforcing parental involvement laws, causing the map to close in on teens, particularly on those in the deep south and midwest. By 2016, only 29 percent of minors remained within 200 miles of a confidential abortion provider. Over this period, the average distance to a confidential abortion increased 800 percent, from 58 miles in 1992 to 454 miles in 2016.====The second contribution of this paper is to estimate the effect of these increased travel distances on teen births. We combine our data on the changing abortion landscape with county-level natality files to estimate the causal impact of parental involvement laws on teen birthrates. The empirical specifications use a difference-in-difference strategy to compare changes in the teen birthrate in states that begin enforcing parental involvement law to those that do not. In addition to simply updating previous findings, our county-level information about the locations of abortion providers allows us to estimate heterogeneous policy effects, using double and triple-difference methodologies to test the hypothesis that the increase in travel distance to avoid the laws caused them to grow teeth, in some cases decades after they were originally passed.====Like Kane and Staiger (1996) and Levine (2003), we do not find evidence that parental involvement laws increased teen birth rates between 1980 and 1992. But we find that parental involvement laws enforced since ==== increase births to teens by an average of 3 percent. We also find evidence that the impacts of parental involvement laws differ substantially with avoidance distance and county poverty rates. A parental involvement law with a 400 mile avoidance distance – approximately a day's drive – has twice the estimated effects on teen birth rates than a parental involvement law with a 25 mile avoidance distance. And a parental involvement law with a 400 mile avoidance distance has three times the estimated effect on teen birth rates in the poorest quartile of counties relative to the rest of the country.",Did parental involvement laws grow teeth?

Analyzing a unique database hosted by the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) that contains information on all kidney ==== in an NKR ","Previous studies have documented the value of a kidney transplant for End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients, including longer life expectancy, lower cost compared to dialysis, and lower government health expenditure (Wolfe et al., 1999, Held et al., 2016). However, there is a significant shortage of kidneys available for transplant. In 2018, approximately 110,000 patients were waiting on the wait list for a kidney transplant (Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, 2018). The creation of kidney-exchange networks, which provide a market that enables patients with living but incompatible donors to swap donors, is the solution proposed by Roth et al. (2004). The previous literature has focused on expanding the number of transplants from creating a large pool of available patient-donor pairs in kidney-exchange networks.==== However, the effect of the expansion of kidney exchange itself on the welfare of patients is unknown.====This paper is the first to assess the causal effect of the adoption of the largest national network, the National Kidney Registry (NKR), by a hospital on the welfare of patients in the kidney exchange market. Participation in a kidney-exchange network enables patients to swap their incompatible living donors in a bigger pool of incompatible patient-donor pairs. Therefore, it increases the marginal value of donors. However, the effect of these networks on the marginal value of the quality of donors is ambiguous. One might expect to see a decline in the quality of matches after the adoption of a network if patients are willing to trade a relatively lower quality donor for shorter wait-time on the waiting list. Alternatively, kidney-exchange networks can increase the incentive of patients in bringing a high-quality donor that is more desirable for trade to improve their chance of finding a compatible donor. The ambiguity in the quality of matches also imposes an empirical question on whether NKR adoption improves the after-transplant health status of a patient. Therefore, we refer patients’ welfare to kidney transplant rate, donors’ characteristics, and recipients’ health status after the transplant in the current discussion.====We combine the information on NKR participation of all transplant centers with a unique database hosted by the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) that contains information on all kidney donors, wait-listed candidates, and transplant recipients in the United States. The first-order effect we show is that NKR adoption increases the likelihood of a wait-listed patient to receive a transplant from a living donor. In obtaining an unbiased estimate in survival analysis, we estimate a duration model proposed by Hinchliffe and Lambert (2013) and Royston and Parmar (2002) to account for the existence of competing events, namely death and receiving a transplant from different sources. We then address the concern of the non-random sorting of patients using two distinct approaches. First, we match NKR and non-NKR hospitals based on observed characteristics using the entropy balancing technique (Hainmueller, 2012). Second, we construct hospital connections based on our unique data about common surgeons among hospitals. We exploit time-by-hospital idiosyncratic variations in the number of NKR connections to instrument for the probability of a hospital joining NKR at a particular year. We find that patients in an NKR hospital are 2.5–3 times more likely than their counterparts in a non-NKR hospital to receive a transplant from a living donor. At the same time, NKR adoption does not have any effect on the transplant rate of the liver or intestines. This placebo test further gives credence on the existence of the NKR impact on the kidney transplant rate.====We then employ a difference-in-differences approach to examine the effect of NKR adoption on the characteristics of donors and the after-transplant health status of patients. The magnitude of the estimates is mostly small and insignificantly different from zero. The null effect is consistent when we use the synthetic control method to address policy endogeneity due to time-varying unobserved heterogeneity (Abadie and Gardeazabal, 2003, Abadie et al., 2010). We add to the literature on the kidney-exchange mechanism by showing that expanding the size of a network of this kind increases efficiency by increasing the volume of trades. In addition, this expansion does not show any decrements in the quality of the match.====In the next section, we discuss the background of the kidney exchange market and introduce the variables that we use to evaluate NKR. In Section 3, we employ a competing risk survival model to study the impact of NKR on kidney transplant rate. Entropy balancing technique and an instrument are used to validate the unbiasedness of the estimates. We then turn to a diff-in-diff model and the synthetic control method in Section 4 to examine the impact of NKR adoption on donors’ characteristics and recipients’ health status.

We conclude that employment during the 33rd and 34th week of gestation is not harmful for expecting mothers (without major problems in pregnancy) and their unborn children.,"Developed countries have special regulations in place to address the safety and health of pregnant workers and their unborn children. One important element of these regulations is ==== (ML). This is the temporary employment-protected period of absence for women around the time of childbirth and should be distinguished from parental leave.==== There is considerable variation in ML arrangements across countries in terms of pre- and postnatal durations, obligation to take ML, job-protection, and income support.==== The median duration of paid and job-protected ML in OECD member countries listed in Table 1 amounts to 16.5 weeks, 6 weeks of which can be taken prior to birth. In this paper, we are interested in ==== ML. We evaluate the impact of maternal employment during pregnancy on child and maternal outcomes. Despite the popular belief that prenatal ML is beneficial to the infant and mother, the empirical evidence on the impact of prenatal ML is limited and existing policies are not evidence-based.====We evaluate a prenatal ML extension in Austria. Until 1973, statutory ML prohibited employment 6 weeks before to (usually) 6 weeks after delivery. The reform in 1974 increased mandatory prenatal ML from 6 to 8 weeks. All other ML regulations (such as the associated transfer payments) remained unaffected by the reform. Our estimation strategy exploits that the assignment to the extended leave was determined by a cutoff date. This gives rise to a fuzzy regression discontinuity design (RDD), which provides us with a ==== (LATE) that identifies the causal effect of an extended ==== ML duration due to being assigned to the new regulations.====Our research design has a number of interesting features. ==== assigned and non-assigned mothers, while having different prenatal ML durations, were both mandated to the ==== ML duration and eligible for the same parental leave. This allows us to cleanly identify the effect of variation in prenatal ML, not only on birth outcomes, but also on post-birth outcomes. Since the reform took place in 1974, we are able to study its long-run effects on children and mothers up to 40 years after birth. This is important, since the fetal origins hypothesis stresses that (health) effects of prenatal events may remain latent for many years (Almond and Currie, 2011a, Almond and Currie, 2011b). To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing studies on prenatal ML or employment during pregnancy examine potential long-run impacts. ====, to check the robustness of our results, we can additionally use information on unaffected non-working mothers, who are not eligible for ML. This second source of variation extends our RDD with a difference-in-differences (DiD) approach. The DiD component differences out potential seasonal effects and accounts for any unobserved characteristics that follow a seasonal pattern between children born in different months. Thus, the combination of these two sources of variation ensures a clean identification of treatment effects. ====, we can rely on high-quality administrative data sources covering the universe of all births in Austria. The ==== (ASSD) provides information on the mother's eligibility for ML, her actual leave duration, and her return to work behavior. Since we observe the actual duration of prenatal ML for each mother, we are able to not only estimate an ==== (ITT) as previous studies in this literature, but we can also identify a LATE of prenatal ML. The ==== comprises several outcomes to assess children's health at birth, and enables us to closely track subsequent maternal fertility. The ASSD further allows to assess children's long-term human capital outcomes (up to 40 years of age) and maternal mortality. For a subsample of mothers and children, we also have data on long-term health outcomes (i.e., health care utilization between 25 and 40 years after birth). ====, the institutional setting promotes a clear interpretation of our results. We analyze the intensive margin of prenatal ML. More specifically, our LATE captures a reduction of ==== exposure to maternal employment in the 33rd and 34th week of gestation for a group of mothers without major problems in this stage of pregnancy.====We consider this estimate to be informative in two ways. It contributes to the literature on the consequences of maternal behavior, in particular employment, in the third trimester of pregnancy on short and long-term health and human capital outcomes. Furthermore, it is informative for designing prenatal ML policies and assessing existing ML regulations. The Austrian ML legislation is comparable to that of other OECD member countries. Among the 16 countries given in Table 1, the median duration of paid and job-protected prenatal ML is 6 weeks, and in many countries, such as Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Hungary or Italy, ML is mandatory for a period of 6 or more weeks prior to birth.====There are several potential mechanisms through which extended prenatal ML could alter the health of pregnant workers and their unborn children. First, the extended absence from work while enjoying job-protection and full income replacement should reduce expecting mother's psychological and physiological stress level. The mandatory nature of ML should reinforce this channel, since pregnant women do not have to justify their leave-taking towards their employer and co-workers. Nevertheless, it is also possible that a longer absence from work increases mental stress for some groups of women. Wüst (2015) argues that exclusion from employment can have adverse effects on psychological stress. Second, certain groups of workers could benefit from a reduction in specific occupational exposures.==== For women whose counterfactual home environment is healthier than their job environment, an extended prenatal ML should have positive effects. At the same time, it cannot be ruled out that, for some women, the counterfactual home environment is less beneficial. In this case, an increase in prenatal ML may have negative effects. In our research design, we can abstract from self-selection into ML with respect to the relative quality of the work versus home environment, since ML is mandatory. Finally, the modified allocation of time (i.e., substituting work with leisure) may also lead to healthier behavior. Expecting mothers may have more time to rest, to follow a healthy diet, or to do necessary prenatal medical check-ups.====The existing literature provides evidence for the importance of these mechanisms. The fetal origins hypothesis and supporting empirical evidence emphasize a number of factors in the prenatal environment that are important for later child and adult outcomes (Almond and Currie, 2011a, Almond and Currie, 2011b). Maternal stress is one such factor. Most studies distinguish the effects of prenatal stress by pregnancy trimester of exposure. The reform we consider in this paper has the potential to reduce maternal stress in the third trimester (more specifically in the 33rd and 34th week of pregnancy). Multiple studies provide evidence that prenatal stress has adverse effects on birth outcomes throughout pregnancy. For instance, Black et al. (2016) find negative effects of stress induced by the death of the mother’s parent during pregnancy on birth outcomes with similar effects across all trimesters of exposure.==== Persson and Rossin-Slater (2018), studying an equivalent treatment with a focus on long-run mental health outcomes, confirm this pattern. Although we do not directly observe maternal stress (e.g., with cortisol levels), a reduction in stress in the third trimester is likely an important causal channel of our treatment. Regarding healthier behavior during pregnancy, a number of factors (such as nutrition and physical activity) are discussed. While causal evidence is lacking for some of these determinants, the importance of prenatal check-ups is documented in design-based studies. For example, Evans and Lien (2005) exploit a 1992 bus strike in Pennsylvania, which led to a sharp decline in prenatal care visits among women pregnant at that time. They conclude that prenatal check-ups reduce maternal smoking and enhance birth weight.====We find no evidence for an impact of the prenatal ML extension on children's health at birth. The estimated treatment effects are statistically insignificant and precisely estimated zero effects. This finding is consistent across subsamples of mothers who are expected to be more vulnerable, such as blue-collar workers. In line with this zero effect on children's health outcomes in the short-run, we also find no evidence for significant effects on long-run health and labor market outcomes. Treated and untreated children have statistically indistinguishable labor market and health outcomes up to the age of 40. Thus, there is also no evidence for latent effects that manifest later in life. Our analysis of subsequent maternal fertility and health also does not reveal any significant effects of the reform. Treated and untreated mothers do not significantly differ in their completed fertility and the timing of subsequent births. The same holds true for maternal health measures up to 40 years after birth. We therefore conclude that the reform had no measurable effects on children and mothers.====The political justification for this reform was to improve the health of pregnant workers and their children. Our evaluation provides no evidence for any impact of the extension from 6 to 8 weeks of prenatal ML. In contrast, the reform has clear cost. It has increased public spending on transfer payments for prenatal ML by one-third and additional cost for firms cannot be ruled out. Importantly, some women may prefer to work during this period, but are not allowed to. While our results must be interpreted within the scope of the Austrian setting, we conclude more generally that mandatory prenatal ML starting in the 35th week of gestation is sufficient for pregnant workers without problems in pregnancy. It should be emphasized that we do not interpret our results as a general argument against (mandatory) prenatal ML. Quite the contrary, we consider our finding to be valuable for designing an optimal prenatal ML policy.====Our findings add to a small stock of empirical evidence on prenatal ML and employment during pregnancy on child and maternal outcomes.==== So far, only a handful of design-based papers provide evidence on the effects of prenatal ML.==== With regards to the United States, there are two studies available. Rossin (2011) evaluates the effects of 12 weeks unpaid but job-protected ML introduced by the ==== (FMLA) in 1993. This policy allows mothers to take a leave during their pregnancy and/or after childbirth. The author’s identification is based on variation in FMLA policies across states and variation in firm coverage. She finds that unpaid ML led to small increases in birth weight, decreases in the likelihood of a premature birth, and substantial decreases in infant mortality. These effects are present only for children of highly educated and married mothers, who were most able to take advantage of unpaid leave. The coefficients on infant mortality are larger in magnitude than on birth outcomes, suggesting that the effects of FMLA are more likely to stem from leave taking after birth. Stearns (2015) evaluates the effect of state-based access to paid ML on health at birth. She exploits the fact that five states were required to start providing wage replacement benefits to pregnant women in the year 1978 through their ==== (TDI) programs. Eligible women could access this ==== paid ML in the period immediately before or after birth. Based on state-level data she implements a difference-in-differences approach, which suggests that access to six weeks of paid ML lowered rates of low birth weight and preterm births by around 3 and 7 percent, respectively. In contrast to Rossin (2011), the effects were driven by disadvantaged African American and unmarried mothers.====Wüst (2015) uses Danish data to study the effect of maternal employment during pregnancy on birth outcomes. She focuses on the pregnancy weeks 12 and 30. To account for selection into employment she exploits variation across pregnancies and compares outcomes of mothers’ consecutive children. She finds that mothers who are employed (either in week 12 or 30) are ==== likely to have a preterm birth. As a potential explanation for this finding she discusses maternal stress caused by not working in a country with a particularly high female employment rate. Del Bono et al. (2012) provide structural parameters of the production functions of birth weight and fetal growth. Applying family-fixed effects models and GMM techniques to American and British survey data, the authors estimate effects of maternal employment during pregnancy. In contrast to Wüst (2015), they find that work interruptions, especially in the last 3 months of pregnancy, are beneficial for birth outcomes. Most recently, Chuard (2018) exploits an Austrian parental leave reform which has indirect effects on prenatal employment for subsequent births. She uses variation in prenatal employment prior to the 32nd week of pregnancy and finds no effects on birth outcomes.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we present our research design. We provide details on the ML system, the reform in the year 1974, and other relevant aspects of the institutional setting. We describe our data sources and present our estimation strategy.

A battery of falsification tests supports a causal interpretation of this finding. Our results are consistent with immediate emotions stirred by a negative stock market performance influencing the number of fatal accidents, in particular among inexperienced investors.","One in two households in the US invest in the stock market directly or indirectly through ownership of mutual and pension funds (Christelis et al., 2013, Guiso and Sodini, 2013). It is well known that stock market performance influences some of the most fundamental economic decisions of investors, such as consumption, saving, and labor supply, through the financial wealth channel (Poterba, 2000). This paper provides evidence that daily fluctuations in the stock market have important – and hitherto neglected – spillover effects in another, unrelated domain of human behavior. Using the universe of fatal road car accidents in the United States from 1990 to 2015, we show that stock market returns influence the number of daily fatal accidents that took place over this period. In particular, we find that a one standard deviation reduction in daily stock market returns increases the number of fatal accidents that happen after the opening of the stock market by 0.6%. This result is robust to a number of falsification tests and is consistent with immediate emotions stirred by stock market fluctuations being the mechanism behind it. Our result thus highlights the broader economic and social consequences of stock market fluctuations.====Research in psychology and behavioral economics has shown that emotional and personality factors influence economic behavior and decision-making in general (Loewenstein, 2000, Lerner et al., 2004, Lerner et al., 2015), including decision-making under risk (Loewenstein et al., 2001, Lerner and Keltner, 2001, Bassi et al., 2013, Cohn et al., 2015, Conte et al., 2016). Building on this evidence, we posit that the psychological distress (e.g., anxiety, anger, frustration) caused by negative stock market returns can make investors more prone to driving errors and lapses. Indeed, research in driving behavior and accident involvement has highlighted the important role of the human factor and the emotional state of the driver, with a particular emphasis on the causal influence of emotions such as anger, anxiety and sadness on driving performance (Elander et al., 1993, Garrity and Demick, 2001, Pêcher et al., 2009, Dula et al., 2010). Beyond emotions, previous literature has also examined the role of various road traffic safety programs and regulations – such as, taxes on alcohol and minimum legal drinking ages, smoking bans, minimum wage laws, mandatory seat belt laws and laws prohibiting text messaging – on driving behavior and traffic fatalities (Ruhm, 1996, Dee, 1999, Baughman et al., 2001, Levitt and Porter, 2001, Cohen and Einav, 2003, Adams and Cotti, 2008, Adams et al., 2012, Abouk and Adams, 2013).====Why do we focus on driving accidents? Driving is an activity that the vast majority of the adult population engages in daily for a considerable amount of time.==== Therefore, it presents a context that allows for identification of the effect of high-frequency (daily) movements of the stock market on an activity that concerns a broad segment of the population. Furthermore, road accidents are a major public health issue. Indeed, they are a leading cause of mortality: the World Health Organization reports that road accidents claim more than 1.2 million lives each year rendering them the ninth leading cause of death across all age groups globally (World Health Organization, 2015). In the US, motor vehicle accidents were ranked 13th overall as a cause of death in 2014, and were the leading cause of death for those aged 16–25 (Webb, 2016). In terms of economic impact, in 2010 the total economic costs of crashes in the US is estimated to have reached $242 billion (Blincoe et al., 2015). Therefore, car accidents provide an ideal setting to examine the effect of stock market fluctuations on behavior in a different domain that has high-stakes consequences.====In our empirical analysis, we merge data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) – a nationwide census of fatal traffic crashes in the US – with financial data (S&P 500 and other indexes) for the 1990–2015 period. We find a negative association between daily stock returns and the number of accidents, which is robust to controlling for year, month and day-of-the-week and various other controls (such as weather and an index of economic uncertainty). When we examine whether the effect is non-linear across the terciles of the stock returns distribution, we find that the impact on accidents is asymmetric, in that – when compared to the reference (middle) tercile, which is roughly centered around zero – it is only present for the bottom tercile (negative returns) but not for the top tercile (positive returns). This result suggests that the connection between stock market and driving behavior is consistent with a framework of reference-dependent preferences (Kőszegi and Rabin, 2006) operating across domains, in which investors’ proclivity to engage in risky behavior while driving (e.g., speeding, drunk, aggressive or distracted driving) is affected by the gain/loss realized in a different domain – the financial market – so that losses in the stock market imply risk-seeking behavior at the wheel.==== We also find that the effect is not driven by extreme low or high stock market returns and is robust to various checks involving alternative measures of returns (Dow Jones Industrial Average index, Value Weighted index) and outcomes (e.g., number of fatalities, number of vehicles involved). Finally, we document that the effect is strongest toward the end of the 1990s, a period associated with exuberance in the US financial market (Phillips et al., 2011) and an increase in stock market participation.====The main threat to identifying a causal link between stock market returns and driving accidents in our analysis is the possibility of omitted variable bias. The relationship that we uncover could be driven by an unobserved factor influencing both stock market and car accidents, rather than stock market performance having an impact on driving behavior and thus the number of accidents. Examples that come to mind include the weather and major political or sports events. It has indeed been shown that exogenous factors that influence investors’ mood (e.g., weather, outcome of sporting events) can have an effect on stock market prices (Saunders, 1993, Kamstra et al., 2003, Hirshleifer and Shumway, 2003, Edmanset al., 2007) and these same events could well influence – through the channel of drivers’ mood – the occurrence of fatal accidents. To address this issue, we first directly control for some potential confounding factors. The fact that the relationship between stock market and accidents is unaffected when we include in the regression controls for environmental conditions like rain or wind or daily indices of stock market and economic policy uncertainty is reassuring, although it is far from resolving the issue.====More importantly, we pursue several falsification tests. In the first set of tests, we exploit the timing of accidents. If the relationship that we find is due to uncontrolled-for events affecting both stock market valuation and driving behavior, we would also expect the relationship to be present for accidents happening before the opening of the stock market. However, we find no relationship in this part of the day, thus providing support for a causal interpretation of the link between stock market returns and accidents. With a similar logic, we show that there is no relationship between car accidents and lead stock market returns.====In the second set of falsification tests, we pursue multiple approaches to compare the effect of the stock market on groups of drivers with different likelihoods of owning stocks. If the relationship that we uncover is due to uncontrolled-for events affecting the mood of both drivers and investors, then we would expect the relationship to be present for all categories of drivers, even those who do not invest in the stock market. Instead, if the relationship is causal, then we would expect the effect to be absent (or weaker) for drivers who do not hold stocks.==== One approach to isolate drivers who are unlikely to hold stocks is to zoom in on accidents involving only people aged 25 or under. For this group, we do not find a statistically significant relationship between accidents and stock market performance, while we see the effect on accidents involving at least one driver older than 25. In another approach, we exploit differences in the geographical distribution of income, with the idea that people with a higher income are more likely to invest in the stock market. We consider average income in both the county of the accident and the drivers’ zip code. In both cases, we find no relationship between stock market and accidents for the lower tercile of income, while there is a strong significant relationship for the upper tercile. Furthermore, we use data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) to construct a measure of stock market exposure (the ratio between the value of the stocks and the net worth) that is subsequently matched to car makes. We then compute the average stock market exposure of the cars involved in each accident. We only find an effect for accidents that are in the top two terciles in terms of stock market exposure, while there is no significant effect for those in the lower tercile. We also split accidents into terciles according to stock market participation in the state where the accident occurred, finding no substantial difference across terciles. Finally, when we divide accidents based on the popularity of google searches for the words “stock market” (measured at the Designated Market Areas level), we find the effect to be present only in the upper tercile. All in all, these tests support a causal interpretation of our results.====To better understand the potential behavioral channels explaining the estimated reduced-form relationship between stock market returns and car crashes, we classify accidents using data on the factors that have contributed to them. First, we find that there is no effect of the stock market on crashes attributed to non-human causes, which reinforces the causal interpretation of our results. Moreover, we can exclude the notion that factors such as speed and distraction are behind our results, while the effect seems to be driven by reckless driving and drunk driving.====Our paper is related to several strands of literature. One strand has identified a relationship between stock returns and physical and mental health, as well as subjective and emotional well-being (e.g., worry, stress, anger). McInerney et al. (2013) show that the 2008 stock market crash had an impact on mental health of older adults in the US, driven by persons with sizeable equity wealth holdings. Cotti et al. (2015) find a negative association between monthly performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the log of monthly drunk-driving fatalities in the period 2003–2010, while they find no association with non-alcohol related fatal accidents.==== Engelberg and Parsons (2016) find a negative inverse link between daily stock returns and hospitalizations in California, particularly for mental health issues.==== Schwandt (2018) finds that stock market shocks affect health outcomes of the elderly in the US. Deaton (2012) shows that the Great Depression has influenced the self-reported well-being of Americans, while Frijters et al. (2015) report that stock market increases positively affect the wellbeing of Australians. Finally, using panel data from the UK, Ratcliffe and Taylor (2015) find that stock price changes are positively associated with mental well-being. Our study also connects to a recent and small but growing stream of literature examining the cross-domain effects of emotional shocks. For example, previous studies have shown that emotional cues triggered by a failure to obtain an expected outcome in the sports domain (unexpected loss) or by extreme traffic congestion, can influence domestic violence (Card and Dahl, 2011, Beland and Brent, 2018) and judicial decisions (Eren and Mocan, 2018). We add to this literature by showing that emotions stirred in the financial domain can have dire external effects on behavior in unrelated activities. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the data and the econometric methods. We report our main results and some robustness and specification checks in Section 3. Section 4 addresses the causality of the effect and some potential behavioral channels. Finally, we offer some concluding remarks in Section 5.",When the market drives you crazy: Stock market returns and fatal car accidents,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629619301237,20 January 2020,2020,Research Article,246.0

Our analysis leverages individual-level administrative data on gym attendance for the universe of students over a five-year period: the three years that the policy was in place, one year before implementation, and one year after termination. This provides us with 100,000 student-year observations and 1.5 million gym visits. Using bunching methods and difference-in-difference designs, we provide four empirical results. First, we document that the policy led to significant bunching at the attendance threshold. Second, we show that the program increased average gym visits by almost five visits per semester, a 20% increase from the mean. Third, we find that the policy not only motivated students who were previously near the threshold, but rather increased attendance across the entire visit distribution. Finally, we show that approximately 50% of the effect persists a year after program termination. Taken together, these results suggest that rebate-framed incentives with a high attendance threshold can induce healthy behaviors in the short-term, and that these positive behaviors persist even after the incentives have been removed.","Less than 5 percent of the adult population in the US engage in the recommended level of daily physical activity (Troiano et al., 2008), and this high level of inactivity may lead to increased medical costs, lowered labor productivity and reduced well-being (e.g. Baicker et al., 2010; Deslandes et al., 2009; Lechner and Sari, 2015). These costs are often born by third parties such as employers, health insurers and state governments. In response to the rising costs of physical inactivity, many of these organizations have initiated a number of different wellness incentive programs to encourage physical activity, with financial subsidies and rebates being the most common ones (NBGH, 2011; Reis, 2012).==== In 2013, close to 70 percent of all US firms with more than 200 employees offered on-site gyms or gym membership discounts (Cawley, 2014).====A rich experimental literature demonstrates positive effects of pay-per-visit fitness incentives on gym attendance (Charness and Gneezy, 2009; Acland and Levy, 2015; Royer et al., 2015). However, the policies implemented by health insurers rarely follow this incentive structure. Instead, most insurance plans that provide fitness incentives offer membership reimbursements, often conditioning the rebate on meeting a specific attendance threshold instead of compensating each visit. For example, Aetna’s “Fitness Reimbursement Program,” UnitedHealthcare’s “Sweat Equity Program,” and Affinity’s “Fitness Rewards,” each offer a membership reimbursement of up to $200 to members who attended the gym 50 times in a six-month period.==== To our knowledge, there exists no research on the effects of gym incentive programs framed as rebates, nor on programs that condition receipt on a high attendance threshold. As a consequence, little is known about the effectiveness of one of the most common incentive programs currently in use.====This paper provides the first evidence in the literature on the effect of gym incentives of this structure by analyzing the introduction and subsequent discontinuation of a large-scale wellness program at a major American university. Conditional on receiving health insurance through the Student Health Plan (SHP), the program offers full reimbursement of the university fitness membership fees ($75) for students who attend the gym at least 50 times during the semester. The SHP requirement means that the program disproportionately benefits graduate students at the university: while almost all of the university’s graduate students have SHP, far fewer undergraduate students rely on this form of health insurance. Both the rebate-framing of the incentive program as well as the high attendance threshold closely resemble many recent fitness programs implemented by US health insurers, state governments, and higher education institutions, making this an important program to evaluate.====To perform our analysis, we exploit individual-level administrative data on gym memberships and gym attendance for the universe of students over a five-year period: the three years that the policy was in place, one year before implementation, and one year after termination. Our data includes 100,000 student-year observations and more than 1.5 million gym visits. This provides us with a larger sample and longer time frame than many of the field experiments on gym incentives that dominate the literature.====We begin by documenting significant bunching at the 50-visit threshold among graduate students in years when the policy is in place, consistent with the policy’s non-linear incentive scheme. Specifically, using the nonparametric bunching method developed in Chetty et al. (2011), we find a large and statistically significant excess mass right above the 50-visit threshold. We find no evidence of bunching among graduate students in the year before the policy took effect nor in the year after the policy was discontinued. In addition, we do not observe bunching for undergraduate students, a group that is largely ineligible for the reimbursement.====The bunching estimator relies on a number of assumptions regarding the exclusion window, functional form, and counterfactual distribution (e.g. Dekker et al., 2016; Blomquist and Newey, 2017; Aronsson et al., 2018; Marx, 2018; Bertanha et al., 2018). To ensure that our results are not driven by the assumptions underlying this estimator, we employ a second estimation strategy, a difference-in-differences design. This approach takes advantage of the fact that we have both pre- and post-policy data as well as a population with almost universal exposure to the policy (graduate students) and a population with very limited exposure (undergraduate students). Results from this analysis reveal that the policy led to a 7 percentage point increase in the likelihood of meeting the 50-visit threshold required for reimbursement. More than half of this effect is driven by an increase in the likelihood of just crossing the threshold (i.e., attending between 50 and 60 times).====Given the design of the incentive, it is not necessarily the case that the observed effects on meeting the attendance threshold translate into a substantial impact on gym attendance; if those who are incentivized to change their gym attendance were very close to the threshold, then the impact of the policy on gym visits will be small. However, we find large increases in average gym attendance as well: the introduction of the policy increased overall gym attendance by almost 5 visits per semester, a 20% increase from the mean. We show that these overall effects are not solely driven by individuals increasing gym attendance just before the end of the reimbursement period. Rather, we find increased gym attendance in each month of the reimbursement period. We find no effects of the policy on the extensive margin (i.e., becoming a gym member).====After identifying a large effect of the policy on gym attendance across all eligible students, we exploit the panel structure of our data to investigate whether these effects are driven by students who were low- or high-frequency gym users prior to the policy’s introduction. While we find the largest effects on crossing the threshold among students who were just below the threshold in the pre-period (a 16 percentage point increase), we also find significant increases among students who attended the gym less than 10 times in the year prior to the policy (a 7 percentage point increase). Thus, even though the threshold for reimbursement was quite high, it still served as motivation for students at the bottom of the attendance distribution.====In our final analysis, we take advantage of the unexpected discontinuation of the program in 2017 to examine if the effects persist over time. Using a difference-in-difference framework similar to our main specification, we compare the post-policy/pre-policy difference in gym attendance of graduate students with that same difference of undergraduate students. We find that the average gym attendance was 2 visits higher per semester in the post-policy period relative to the pre-policy period among graduate students compared to undergraduate students. This finding suggests that roughly half of the program effect persisted in the year after the policy was terminated, suggesting a higher degree of persistence than observed in prior studies (Acland and Levy, 2015; Royer et al., 2015). Given the high attendance requirement under our policy, these findings are consistent with the theoretical model in Carrera et al. (2017) and the empirical results in Harris and Kessler (2019), which suggests that crossing a habit “threshold” may be necessary in order to achieve sustained effects on gym attendance and exercise.====This paper makes several important contributions to the literature. First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to explore the effects of a gym incentive program framed as a rebate. This type of program closely models what many institutions and employers have implemented in recent years, both in design (reimbursement conditional on attendance) and with respect to the attendance threshold level (50 visits in six months), making our results informative about the effectiveness of existing programs. Additionally, while other studies have examined the effect of providing free memberships on attendance (Cappelen et al., 2017; Carrera et al., 2017), the loss-framing nature of the reimbursement program we study may be more effective at encouraging attendance (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979; Levitt et al., 2016; Field, 2009; Hossain and List, 2012; Rees-Jones, 2018).====Second, while a number of papers have evaluated the effectiveness of incentives for gym attendance (Charness and Gneezy, 2009; Acland and Levy, 2015; Royer et al., 2015; Carrera et al., 2017; Cappelen et al., 2017; Carrera et al., 2018), this literature relies on results from field experiments rather than evaluations of institution-wide policies. The benefit of the natural experiment that we examine is that incentives were available for a longer time period and that it provides us with a larger sample size. In addition, we do not actively recruit participants. This is important, as individuals who selectively enroll in a study on gym incentives might be more likely to respond to the incentive in question, yielding effects that may be larger than what would be observed in the general population. However, it should be noted that our study population consists of students at a higher education institution. These individuals are more educated, and likely face tighter budget constraints, than the general population. While this represents a large and important population, an interesting question for future research is to what extent these results can be generalized to the regular (non-student) workplace settings.====Third, our paper contributes to a large literature evaluating the benefits of workplace wellness programs. While a meta-analysis of the effectiveness of these programs shows substantial cost savings in the form of reduced medical costs and worker absenteeism (Baicker et al., 2010), a recent study by Jones et al. (2018) finds no effects of a large university’s wellness program on health expenditures and health behaviors (including gym attendance). One key difference between the wellness program studied in Jones et al. (2018) and the program studied in our setting, is that their program was more comprehensive, providing financial incentives for a wide variety of wellness activities. Our results suggest that programs that target a specific activity, such as gym attendance, may be more successful at changing behaviors. This is interesting in light of recent studies showing that increased gym attendance leads to improved academic performance (Cappelen et al., 2017).====Lastly, our results contribute to the debate on whether the effects of gym incentives persist after the incentive is removed. While some studies in the gym attendance literature find evidence of persistent effects (Charness and Gneezy, 2009), others show that effects fade shortly after the incentives are removed (Acland and Levy, 2015; Royer et al., 2015). We find that roughly half of the treatment effect persists in the year after the program was discontinued. This is particularly encouraging since prior studies that have identified persistent effects of gym incentive programs only considered a follow-up period of a few months (Charness and Gneezy, 2009; Acland and Levy, 2015).====This rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides institutional background and economic intuition. Section 3 introduces our data and empirical strategy. Section 4 presents the main results on bunching and overall gym attendance. Section 5 investigates heterogeneity in response by pre-policy attendance. Section 6 presents results on effect persistence.

Inequality ","Economic, social and health inequalities present major public policy challenges in many countries. The increase in income and wealth inequality in many western nations during the last part of the twentieth century is well documented (Piketty, 2013, Blundell et al., 2018, Garbinti et al., 2018). Less well appreciated has been a rising concern about health distributions in many of these same countries. In the UK, for instance, growth in life expectancy has flattened in recent years and is falling in some population groups, while health inequalities are rising (Buck et al., 2018). Similarly, life expectancy in the US has fallen in recent years while inequalities have been increasing (Murphy et al., 2018, Chetty et al., 2016).====The optimal policy response to such inequalities depends in part on citizens’ attitudes toward them. Such attitudes are normally represented in economics by an inequality-aversion parameter of the individualistic social welfare function. In the standard formulation, inequality aversion is rooted in risk aversion derived from the concavity of utility (Cowell and Schokkaert, 2001). In addition to this, many (e.g., Thurow, 1971, Alexander, 1974, Alesina and Giuliano, 2011) have posited a distinct concern regarding inequality ====. Concerns about inequalities and inequities have long figured prominently in the health sector (Williams and Cookson, 2000), but studies document other-regarding preferences and people's general concern for equity and inequality in wide-ranging economic contexts (Fehr and Schmidt, 1999, Charness and Rabin, 2002, Camerer and Fehr, 2006), and the presence of inequality aversion distinct from risk aversion (Johansson-Stenman et al., 2002, Kroll and Davidovitz, 2003, Davidovitz and Kroll, 2004, Carlsson et al., 2005). Further, while risk preferences are documented to vary across decision domains (Einav et al., 2012), evidence regarding differences in inequality aversion attitudes across domains is limited (Costa-Font and Cowell, 2019). Going back at least to Tobin (1970), however, economists and others have posited that concern for inequality is domain specific and that, for instance, aversion to health inequalities is likely larger than aversion to income inequalities, in part because many accept that some degree of income inequality is necessary to provide incentives to work hard and in part because good health is a pre-requisite for engaging in a wide range of life pursuits (Anand, 2002).====Formal estimates of inequality aversion parameters confirm that, on average, individuals are averse to inequality in both income and health, though there is considerable heterogeneity of attitudes among individuals and we are unaware of any published study that provides estimates for income and health elicited using the same estimation methodology. Cropper et al. (2016) elicit inequality aversion attitudes for each, but do so using different methodologies that are known to generate quite different estimates. Beyond differences in elicitation methods, comparison of estimates within and across domains is complicated by differences in the ways income or health are operationalized, the role of risk, the role of egoistic versus other-regarding preferences, and related matters.====For income, estimates of an Atkinson inequality aversion parameter derived using Okun's leaky bucket approach (Okun, 1975)—which asks people how much leakage, or loss, they will tolerate when transferring income from the rich to the poor—fall in the range of 0.2–0.3 (Amiel et al., 1999, Pirttila and Uusitalo, 2010). In contrast, those derived using the distributional approach—which asks people directly about their preferences over alternative income distributions with differing means and dispersions—fall in the range of 2–3 (Johansson-Stenman et al., 2002, Carlsson et al., 2005, Pirttila and Uusitalo, 2010). In the health domain, the inability to transfer health directly among people renders the leaky bucket approach infeasible, so all studies adopt a variant of the distributional approach, though there is considerable diversity regarding framing of the choice scenario and the health outcome used (e.g., life expectancy at birth, remaining years of life, quality-adjusted life-years, serious illness of defined length, health risks, proportion of full health, etc.). While all find that, on average, people are averse to health inequality, estimates of Atkinson aversion parameters encompass a wide range from less than 1.5 to over 25 (Dolan and Tsuchiya, 2011, Attema et al., 2015, Cropper et al., 2016, Robson et al., 2017). We are not aware of any studies that examine socio-economic-related health inequalities within a fully bi-variate framework that presents bi-variate distributions defined over health and income and elicits an aversion parameter for a bi-variate social-welfare function.====This study presents estimates of inequality aversion parameters amongst the general public in Ontario, Canada for each of annual income, lifetime health (life expectancy), and income-related health distributions within a consistent framework that enables their comparison.==== Following the literature, we present estimates of the median value of the inequality-aversion parameter for each, but in addition estimate mean inequality aversion using both a structural approach derived from the assumed social welfare function and a reduced-form approach that imposes no assumptions on the functional form of the social welfare function. We examine the associations between observable individual characteristics and aversion attitudes, and extend the structural approach to a latent-class setting that accommodates unobserved heterogeneity across participants. Finally, we gain insight into participants’ reasoning by analyzing their written explanations for why they made the choices they did.====We find substantial aversion to inequalities in both income and health. While the mean estimate of inequality aversion is greater for income than for health, more importantly, the underlying distributions of aversion attitudes differ notably, with a highly bi-modal distribution of inequality-aversion values for health whereby nearly half of the participants exhibit low levels of aversion and nearly half exhibit high levels of aversion. Although there is substantial variability in the extent of aversion across individuals, this variation is only weakly associated with socio-economic and demographic characteristics.","Inequality aversion in income, health, and income-related health",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629619304722,16 January 2020,2020,Research Article,248.0

These debates thus far have been studied in isolation leading to confusion and lingering questions. I look at these three debates holistically and present a welfare theoretic model that is consistent with the practice of CEA and can help inform all of these three debates. It shows rationales for the recommendations of the Second Panel and clarifies some nuanced implications for the practice of CEA when taking a societal perspective in the context of distributional CEA and multi-sectorial budgets.","Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) is a method that decision-makers can use to maximize a measure of health, such as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), subject to a budget constraint. In this paper, I provide a detailed welfare-based economic foundation of this practice that helps answer many debates within the CEA literature and move it forward for future practices. CEA is often referred to as cost-utility analysis, under the presumption that QALYs are measures of the ====, in the economic sense of the word that represents well-being as a function of both consumption and health. The empirical literature has shown that QALYs are a mere representation of the preferences for health rather than utilities themselves. (Meltzer et al., 1999; Sendi and Brouwer, 2005; Tilling et al., 2010) Naturally, the question arises as to what type of social welfare function over both health and consumption, when maximized under a resource constraint, will align with the practice of trying to maximize a measure of health given resource constraints using CEA. Consequently, what I present in this paper is not a normative foundation of what a cost-effectiveness analysis should look like from classical welfare theoretic foundations. Others have attempted it, and I discuss the challenges of doing so below. Instead, what I present is a positive welfare foundation that aligns with the practice of CEA, which aims to maximize preferences for health, and only health, given societal resource constraints.====Attempts have been made to explain the CEA approach from a classical welfare economic perspective in which a decision-maker maximizes a utility function, typically a function of both consumption and health, subject to a universal budget constraint that is used to allocate resources towards both consumption and health. (Johannesson, 1995; Garber and Phelps, 1997; Meltzer, 1997; Bleichrodt and Quiggin, 1998) The decision-maker in these models are typically thought to be an individual representative patient or consumer. The representative consumer model can also represent a social decision-maker seeking to maximize an aggregate of individual utilities, as long as all individuals in the society have identical preferences. When individuals have heterogeneous utility functions, aggregation of individual utilities to form uniform optimal allocation rules for a social decision-maker is notoriously difficult, if not impossible. (Arrow, 1950) Developments in the past decades in the field of aggregation economics (see Chiappori and Eckland (Chiappori and Ekeland, 2011) for a review) have identified alternate models of aggregate utility functions. However, it is difficult to find an acceptable structure of individual utility function over own’s health and consumption that would lead to an aggregated utility that can focus solely on the preferences for health, as CEA does, and ignore the utility of consumption, but still be consistent with welfare economic principles.====Therefore, I start with accepting the notion that the practice of CEA is rationalized under an extra-welfarist foundation of economic theory in which health is the central objective function. (Hurley, 2000; Coast, 2004; Birch and Donaldson, 2003; Brouwer et al., 2008)==== However, the optimization principle under the extra-welfarism has often reverted to maximizing health under a siloed healthcare budget constraint to develop implications for the practice of CEA from a healthcare sector perspective. A consistent societal perspective, to my knowledge, has never been articulated under the extra-welfarist principle. In countries like the US, where there is no specific health budget constraint, implications of the siloed healthcare budget-constrained models may not be applicable. More recently, discussions on a societal perspective for CEA argue that incorporating the effect of health on other sectors of the economy is only possible if we find a way to measure the utility of consumption in other sectors to compare them to the utility of health. (Walker et al., 2019) However, it is not clear under what objective function, individualistic or aggregate, such arguments hold. What this paper shows is a middle ground, where one can continue to invoke the extra-welfarist principle of trying to maximize health, but subject to a societal resource constraint that can be used to pay for health and also other consumptions, without the complications of measuring the individualistic utility of consumptions.====Despite the use of the extra-welfarist principle of maximizing health, deriving consistency with the welfare theoretic foundation is important for understanding the impact of health on other economic dimensions in society. Failing to account for these dimensions, as often practiced with a healthcare sector perspective in CEA, may lead to inefficient allocation of resources when the budget constraint is societal and not a siloed healthcare-specific budget. In fact, I show that even in a multi-sectorial society with siloed budget structures, it may be inefficient to not account for the other economic dimension on the society, if those sectorial budgets are also allocated efficiently.====With this stand, I explore the aggregate utility function of a social decision-maker who cares about the individual demands for both health and consumption, but under which the practice of CEA can still be rationalized. To be very clear, the central goal of this decision-making process is efficiency in the allocation of health in the Pareto sense. It implies that, compared to the outcome of this decision process, there is no other allocation of health across individual members of the society given prices and available resources that could make all members better off in terms of their health and one of them strictly so. Since, in the spirit of QALYs – the main outcome measure in CEA, each unit of health is valued to be the same irrespective of who gains it, such Pareto allocation would suffice if total health is maximized. Naturally, one can expect that the social decision-maker’s utility would depend on some form of total health and total consumption in the population. I will later extend this formulation to incorporate that fact that the social decision-maker’s utility can depend on the sum of preference-weighted consumption and the sum of preference-weighted health in the population, where individuals may have different preferences for their respective consumption and health. The same construct can be used to impose the social decision-maker’s preferences for an individual’s consumption and health, leading to a foundation for distributional CEA.====To begin, I draw from the literature that has looked into the question of whether CEA, which maximizes health and not utility, should ever be consistent with classical welfare theoretic principles that aim to maximize utility for a representative consumer. (Johannesson, 1995; Bleichrodt and Quiggin, 1998; Phelps and Mushlin, 1991) Although this literature has always approached this question from a representative consumer perspective, I study the implications for the functional form of the utility in these works to approach a feasible utility function for a societal decision-maker that provides us with a welfare foundation for the practice of CEA. Next, I begin by addressing two different and persistent debates in the context of aligning cost-effectiveness analysis with a welfare-economic perspective. The first is whether future costs (both non-healthcare consumption and healthcare costs) should be included in an additional year of life produced by an intervention. (Garber and Phelps, 1997; Meltzer, 1997; Feenstra et al., 2008; Meltzer, 2006, 2008; Nyman, 2004) Second, there is the debate on whether costs and benefits should be discounted at the same rate in the future years. (Gravelle et al., 2007; Claxton et al., 2011; Paulden and Claxton, 2012) Unfortunately, the CEA literature looking at these three debates has approached these subjects in isolation and, consequently, generated lingering questions when an assumption in one debate ignores the requirements of the other.

These changes may be attributed to behavioral responses including increased attention to the immediate hedonic effects of sexual contact, increased sexual frequency, as well as delayed discounting and ignoring the future costs associated with sex. Our findings on births suggest that behavioral factors can counteract the physiological changes from ==== that tend to decrease fertility. Our findings are robust to a broad set of tests.","Conventional wisdom suggests that sex and mood-enhancing drugs go together. Indeed, it is a cliché that sex, marijuana, and rock and roll are connected. Recent legislation increasing the availability of marijuana has generated increased interest on the consequences of its consumption on sex and fertility. For instance, the medical literature has provided evidence that cannabis-related compounds negatively impact reproductive physiology. Marijuana consumption, however, heightens sensory perception, increases relaxation, reduces stress and diminishes anxiety (e.g., Palamar et al., 2018). Enhanced senses may contribute to an increase in sexual activity. A feeling of relaxation may change attitudes toward sexual risks by making users less concerned about the consequences of intercourse, resulting in decreased contraceptive use or users taking on more sexual partners. In this context it is unclear whether any potential behavioral changes in individuals may help compensate the potential reduction in fertility due to physiological mechanisms.====A large correlational literature documents the association between marijuana and sex including research showing that marijuana use is linked with increased sexual activity, multiple sexual partners, risky sexual behavior, and increased attention to hedonic effects of sexual contact.==== The existing literature, however, does not take into account that the association between marijuana use and sex may be endogenously driven by unobserved factors such as a propensity for risk taking. Equally problematic is that sexual activity may be causing an increase in marijuana use. In addition, previous studies are limited in terms of size and representativeness and have rarely been published in the economic literature (e.g., Sarvet et al., 2018; Sun and Eisenberg, 2017). To our knowledge there are no causal studies on the relationship between marijuana law liberalization and variables related to sexual activity and childbirth.====The fact that the causal relationship is unknown raises questions about the spillover effects on sexual behavior of more liberal marijuana laws and policies. It remains unclear if the negative physiological impacts predicted by the medical sciences will cause a decrease in births, or if we will instead observe an increase in births due to the behavioral changes caused by marijuana use. We therefore add to the literature by estimating the causal impact of MMLs on sexual behavior and birth counts. Specifically, we provide evidence that the passage of medical marijuana laws increases birthrates. Increased births are explained by a higher likelihood of an individual having sex, and a lower likelihood of contraceptive use conditional on having sex.====The causal effect of marijuana use on births and sexual behavior is identified by exploiting the variation in timing of the introduction of medical marijuana laws among states in a difference-in-differences (DID) research design that uses data from multiple restricted-use sources. Such data sets include the Vital Statistics Natality files, the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97), and the Nielsen Retail Scanner database. Though legalization was only for medical use, earlier work (as well as our own), suggests that increased use among young adults was in large part due recreational take up of marijuana after a law change. Therefore, we also estimate models that focus on laws allowing home cultivation in a state. We do this because home cultivation is one of the clearest avenues by which marijuana may be diverted from medical to recreational use. We find that MMLs substantially increase “any” marijuana use among young adults by 4.4 percentage points (29 % of the mean). There is a subsequent increase in the birthrate of around 2% relative to the mean, which is explained by a higher likelihood of having sex and a lower likelihood of contraceptive use. These changes in sexual behavior are also reflected in lower county level sales of condoms and a temporary increase in the incidence of male gonorrhea. Using event studies, we confirm that there are no pre-existing trends in sexual behaviors or birth counts. We also show that our results are unlikely spurious through placebo tests where we randomly generate false dates for law changes.","Sex, marijuana and baby booms",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629619301882,28 December 2019,2019,Research Article,250.0

Between 2000 and 2014, the number of annual emergency department (ED) visits in the United States rose 33 million. The number of EDs in operation fell by 242 (Trendwatch, 2018). The result of this divergence was a 39% increase in the average number of visits made to each ED per year (Fig. 1). What is more, emergency physicians say “they've seen [ED] patient visits surge since [2014 when] Obamacare took effect – just the opposite of what many Americans expected would happen” (Ungar and O’Donnell, 2015).====While the research community has undertaken considerable efforts to understand the effects of ED crowding, investigators have struggled to find exogenous sources of variation in patient volumes with which to identify causal effects. This has forced investigators to rely instead on observational study designs. Although observational designs are useful for establishing correlations, they cannot disentangle causality. EDs with high patient volumes, for example, differ from EDs with low patient volumes in important ways that cannot be quantified. These differences may result in disparate patient outcomes, regardless of crowding differentials. Similarly, trends in patient volumes within given EDs may stem from trends in public health. Trends in public health clearly impact clinical outcomes. This has prevented a clear understanding of what would happen to a single patient if all aspects of their ED visit remained constant – except for the number of other patients simultaneously seeking care.====To identify the impact of ED crowding on patient mortality, this study uses a natural experiment. The variation this study exploits stems from strong discontinuities in crowding that are felt inside existing EDs at the time a new ED opens nearby. If, among “old” EDs, the patients who leave are random with respect to their prognoses, and if the physicians and infrastructures inside the old EDs do not discontinuously change, then discontinuities in patient outcomes within the old facilities on the opening date can reasonably be attributed to abrupt alleviations of crowding, as this is the only variable that effectively changes in old EDs on the date a new ED opens nearby.====To conduct this analysis, I consider seven EDs in the state of South Carolina each located near an ED that opened between 2004 and 2010. Using hospital administrative records from these facilities linked to death records, I demonstrate first the strong discontinuity in these EDs’ level of crowding. On the date a new ED opens nearby, the number of patients in old EDs abruptly falls by an average of 10%. I then verify that the clinical characteristics of the patients in old EDs do not discontinuously change on the opening date and that there are not discontinuities in hospital staffing. That is, that the two primary determinants of a patient’s outcome, their health at presentation and their healthcare providers, do not change at the same time as crowding. This provides grounding to compare the outcomes of patients in the old EDs immediately before versus immediately after a new ED opens nearby to identify the impact of crowding.====The results suggest that a 10% alleviation of ED patient volume significantly lowers the average patient’s chance of mortality. Patients who are exposed to 10% fewer ==== patients in the ED are 0.28 percentage-point more likely to be alive 30 days after their discharge date. Six months after their discharge date, they are 0.45 percentage-point more likely to still be alive. These effect sizes correspond to 24% and 17% reductions in 30-day and 6-month mortality rates, respectively, relative to the baseline rates of 1.14% and 2.60%.====How does ED crowding affect patient mortality? One working paper suggests shorter ED wait times may save patients’ lives (Gruber et al., 2018). While these data do not include wait times, the evidence here is consistent with wait times being a mechanism. First, rates of mortality ==== the ED are unaffected by crowding. Yet, the patients who are at risk of dying inside the ED should be seen first upon arrival, so their wait times might also be unaffected by crowding. A second piece of evidence suggesting wait times may be a mechanism is that rates of leaving against medical advice are lower when crowding is lower. Importantly, leaving against medical advice occurs more frequently when wait times are long (Bindman et al., 1991). Moreover, many of the patients who leave against medical advice are at risk of near-term mortality. For instance, rates of 6-month mortality are statistically indistinguishable between “stayers” and “leavers”. Therefore, it could be that crowding affects wait time, which affects leaving against medical advice, which affects mortality outside of the hospital.====That the findings of this study are based on seven EDs does limit external validity. However, the robustness of the results and the consistency of the findings with anecdotal evidence that crowding harms patients points to a troubling prospect. The extreme crowding that is plaguing EDs across the U.S. may be contributing to premature deaths.",Swamped: Emergency Department Crowding and Patient Mortality,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629618311676,28 December 2019,2019,Research Article,251.0

To account for endogeneity and ensure that the change in Mexican immigration arose from supply shifts, we use 2SLS and ","The last few decades have seen a dramatic increase in Mexican immigration to the United States. The number of Mexican immigrants in the United States has quintupled since 1980, rising from 2.2 million to 11.6 million in 2015. Persons born in Mexico now comprise over 25% of the foreign-born population in the U.S., whereas the country with the next highest share of foreign-born residing in the U.S. is India, with 5.9%. This rise in Mexican immigration translates to a higher share of workers who are Mexican immigrants. As shown in Fig. 1, the share of workers who are Mexican immigrants also quintupled during this period, from 1 percent in 1980 to 5 percent in 2015. This change in the composition of the workforce likely impacted work and working conditions for native workers employed in the same local labor markets as the new immigrant workers. In this paper, we provide the first evidence on the relationship between increased Mexican immigration and one measure of the work environment: workplace safety.====Over this period of rising Mexican immigration, a number of measures indicate that workplace safety improved in the United States, particularly for non-Hispanic workers (Richardson et al., 2004). Between 1980 and 2015, the overall rate of nonfatal occupational injuries fell by over 60 percent, from 8.8 per 100 workers in 1980 to 3.0 per 100 workers in 2015,==== and data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) show that the rate of Workers’ Compensation (WC) cash benefit receipt (hereafter WC receipt or WC claims) among workers fell by 68 percent, from 2.0 percent in 1980 to 0.64 percent in 2015, as shown in Fig. 1.==== However, no consensus has been reached about why workplace injury rates and WC claims have fallen so dramatically.====Though a previously unexplored mechanism in the decline in workplace injuries for U.S. natives, Mexican immigration may have improved workplace safety for native workers if immigrants work in riskier jobs and cause natives to shift into safer jobs. In this paper, we examine the role of Mexican immigration in these improvements in workplace safety by addressing the following three research questions. First, does “occupational risk”—a measure of how risky a particular job is—fall more for natives residing in states that experience more exposure to Mexican immigration? Second, does the occupational health of non-Mexicans, as measured by receipt of WC benefits, improve among those workers who are more exposed to Mexican immigration? And, finally, how much of the decline in WC receipt overall can be explained by increased Mexican immigration?====To test whether increased Mexican immigration resulted in lower occupational risk for native workers we create a measure of occupational risk using O*NET’s information on physical work conditions that we benchmark to the job’s occupational risk in 2010. This allows us to analyze changes in workers’ job risk over time arising from changes in occupation, not improvements in working conditions within a job. Our measure of occupational risk is the occupation’s percentile rank in the 2010 distribution of physical conditions—a higher percentile corresponds to an occupation having more physical demands and greater risk of injury. We quantify immigration from Mexico at the state level using the 1980, 1990, and 2000 Decennial Census, and the 2001–2015 American Community Surveys (ACS). We examine whether natives residing in states that experienced larger increases in Mexican immigration experience greater reductions in occupational risk, as measured by the physical requirements of the job described by O*NET.====To account for the endogeneity of immigrants’ location choices and to ensure that the increases in Mexican immigration we identify are from increases in supply and not demand (e.g., a construction boom), we use instrumental variables strategies based on the historical distribution of Mexican immigrants and on proximity to the Mexican border and estimate models using two-stage least squares (2SLS). We find that increased Mexican immigration has led to natives working in jobs with a lower measure of occupational risk, on average. In fact, Mexican immigration can explain 26 percent of the improvements in occupational risk among natives between 1980 and 2015, and these effects are concentrated among native workers with “medium” levels of education—a high school degree or some college.====We turn to the March Current Population Survey (CPS) to measure the effect of Mexican immigration on natives’ occupational health. Our measure of occupational health is a binary measure of whether the non-Mexican==== reports receiving income from WC within the past year (i.e., WC cash benefits). A worker who has been injured on the job and has missed several days of work is eligible to receive cash benefits from WC, so this measure allows for studying the effect of Mexican immigration on relatively major occupational health incidents. The second key finding from our analysis is that Mexican immigration lowered WC claims for non-Mexicans; Mexican immigration explains approximately 17 percent of the reduction in WC claims among non-Mexican males between 1980 and 2015.====We then assess the role of Mexican immigration on WC claims overall, that is, with Mexicans included in the sample. Mexican immigration could lower overall WC claim rates if immigrants are healthier than natives (see, e.g., Antecol and Bedard, 2006 and Giuntella, 2017) or if they are less likely to file for WC if injured (see, e.g., Orrenius and Zavodny, 2013; Smith, 2012). We find that increased Mexican immigration indeed led to a reduction in WC claims overall, accounting for approximately 11 percent of the decline in WC receipt among male workers during this period. This decline in WC claims is one of the major occupational health trends that has occurred in recent decades (Boden and Ruser, 2003), and no consensus has been reached regarding its cause. In addition, employer WC costs are high in the US—totaling nearly $95 billion in 2015—so understanding factors that explain the downward trend in WC receipt has implications for employer WC costs, and we provide the first evidence that Mexican immigration had an impact on employer WC costs.====In summary, our results point to Mexican immigration leading to meaningful improvements in workplace safety for native and non-Mexican workers and fewer WC claims overall. This study contributes to the recent research in economics that has explored the effect of immigration on occupational health by examining the impact of Mexican immigration to the United States on the occupational health and safety of U.S. natives. While Giuntella and Mazzonna (2015) and Giuntella et al. (2018) show that immigration to England, Wales, and Germany has led to natives in these countries having safer jobs, both the labor market and the pool of incoming immigrants are different in the United States than in these countries, and it is not clear that the effects of Mexican immigration to the United States will have the same effect as immigration in Europe. Increased Mexican immigration can explain 26 percent of the improvement in the work environment for native U.S. workers and 17 percent of the reduction in WC claims among non-Mexican males in the U.S. The study’s focus on the effect of immigration on a non-wage job amenity in the U.S. is also a contribution to the broader literature on the effect of immigration on the occupational choices of U.S. natives (Peri and Sparber, 2009).====Additionally, by providing the first estimates of how much of the dramatic 68 percent decline in WC receipt in the U.S. overall can be explained by increased Mexican immigration, this study also contributes to research that seeks to understand the dramatic decline in WC rates over the past few decades (e.g., Boden and Ruser, 2003). We show that increased Mexican immigration contributed to the reduction in WC claims observed during this time period, explaining approximately 11 percent of the overall decline in WC receipt among all male workers during this period. Thus, without Mexican immigration, employer costs for WC would have been higher.",The role of Mexican immigration to the United States in improved workplace safety for natives from 1980 to 2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629619303005,26 December 2019,2019,Research Article,253.0

This rise in harms has occurred contemporaneous with a tripling in the amount of opioids that were prescribed from 1999 to 2015 (Guy et al., 2017). By 2015, the amount of opioids prescribed per person in the U.S., 640 morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs), was enough for every American to be medicated around the clock for three weeks, equivalent to 5 mg hydrocodone every 4 h.====Several indicators suggest at least some of this expansion in opioid use is medically inappropriate. Physicians in counties in the highest quartile of prescribing write six times more (in MMEs) than those in the lowest quartile, and most of this variation cannot be explained by conventional patient, area socioeconomic, or market characteristics (Guy et al., 2017). Medical-claims-based indicators suggest that inappropriate prescribing behavior is common. In a sample of approximately 3 million commercially-insured adults who received an opioid prescription, about a quarter had at least one indicator of inappropriate prescribing, and 5.8 percent had two or more (Liu et al., 2013). Other work shows that physicians trained at less-selective medical schools write significantly more opioid prescriptions than those trained at more-selective schools (Schell and Currie, 2017).====These circumstances offer health plans the opportunity to improve prescribing practices through management of their physicians. For two reasons, Medicare Part D is an ideal setting in which to investigate the extent to which plans have taken advantage of this opportunity.====First, inappropriate use of opioids in Medicare Part D is an important policy problem. Medicare Part D is a voluntary (but highly subsidized) outpatient prescription drug benefit that started in 2006. All 59 million Medicare beneficiaries are entitled to prescription drug coverage through a private plan approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS); in 2017, more than 42 million beneficiaries enrolled in a Part D plan (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2017).====Since the adoption of Part D, Medicare has become the largest purchaser of prescription opioids, covering about 20–30% of total U.S. spending on opioids (Zhou et al., 2016). Several indicators suggest that there is inappropriate opioid use in Medicare. Many Medicare beneficiaries have concurrent opioid prescriptions from multiple prescribers (Jena et al., 2014). Opioid prescribing in Medicare is concentrated among a small number of high prescribers: in the Part D program, 35% of opioids by value were prescribed by the top 1% of prescribers, and 78% were prescribed by the top 10% of prescribers (Chen et al., 2016). According to the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, almost half of beneficiaries from some states (Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana) received at least one opioid prescription in 2016, and “extreme use” and “questionable prescribing” have put almost 90,000 beneficiaries at serious risk for opioid misuse or overdose (HHS OIG, 2017). In addition, the consequences of opioid prescribing in Medicare may spill over to the population more broadly: the expanded access to opioids resulting from the adoption of Part D appears to have increased opioid misuse among the Medicare-ineligible population (Powell et al., 2015).====Second, the way that Part D covers prescription drugs has created a natural experiment with which to evaluate the effects of insurer strategies on inappropriate opioid use. Part D takes two different forms in which insurers have very different incentives and abilities to control inappropriate use of prescription opioids. Beneficiaries can obtain Part D coverage through their choice of either a stand-alone prescription drug plan (PDP) that supplements traditional fee-for-service Medicare, or a Medicare Advantage prescription drug plan (MA-PD) that is integrated with a Medicare Advantage plan that covers all Medicare benefits including drugs. While the administrator of a PDP has essentially no incentive or ability to manage the physicians who prescribe covered drugs, the administrator of a MA-PD plan has the incentive to account for the spillover effects of prescription drug use on the cost of care overall and can choose which physicians to include in its network and how it manages care. Previous work has found that the integration of MA-PD prescription drug coverage with the other benefits provided by Medicare Advantage plans has some beneficial effects: MA-PD plans have more generous prescription drug coverage than PDP plans, which translates into higher prescription drug utilization by enrollees, driven by drugs that reduce overall medical expenditures and treat chronic conditions (Starc and Town, 2018).====These same forces could also lead to less opioid use in MA-PD versus PDP plans. Yet, no work has investigated whether this is the case. This paper seeks to fill this gap. We use Medicare Part D claims to compare the rate of opioid prescriptions for patients enrolled in in MA-PD plans versus PDPs. For each beneficiary, we construct four measures of the amount of opioids prescribed in 2014: any prescription for an opioid; any prescription for an opioid from a high prescriber, defined as the top 1% of prescribers in terms of number of opioid prescriptions written; any prescription for > 7 days’ supply of an opioid, conditional on any opioid; and any prescription for > 7 days’ supply of an opioid from a high prescriber, conditional on any opioid from a high prescriber.====We estimate the effects on the amount of opioids prescribed of enrollment in an MA-PD plan using instrumental variables. For our instrument we use a discontinuity in the rules governing payments to MA-PD (but not PDP) plans that give greater payments to MA-PD plans that cover beneficiaries who live in counties that are part of Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) with populations of 250,000 or more. These counties are sometimes described as “urban floor” counties. The sharp difference in payment rates at the urban floor creates incentives for MA-PD plans to reduce premiums and increase the generosity of benefits in counties above versus below the cutoff. The lower premiums and expanded benefits enhance beneficiaries’ incentives to enroll in Medicare Advantage. The induced incremental enrollment, in turn, allows us to identify the effect of MA-PD plans on opioid prescription rates independent of any unmeasured characteristics of beneficiaries or areas – as long as the urban floor is not correlated with these unmeasured characteristics. This approach has been used in other work to identify the effect of enrollment in Medicare Advantage on other outcomes, such as the hospitalization rate, medical spending, prescription drug use overall, and mortality (e.g., Afendulis et al., 2017; Cabral et al., 2018; Duggan et al., 2016; Starc and Town, 2018).",The effects of medicare advantage on opioid use,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629619304758,26 December 2019,2019,Research Article,254.0

Applying a direct ,"Health inequality has many sources, not all of which are equally objectionable. The existing literature focuses on socio-economic inequalities in health and variations associated with differences in living conditions, access to health care, and health-related lifestyle (e.g., Contoyannis and Jones, 2004; Baum and Ruhm, 2009). This literature implicitly suggests a distinction between legitimate and illegitimate inequalities. Building on Roemer’s (1998, 2002) influential formalisation of the concept of inequality of opportunity (IOp), the “egalitarian” framework does not necessarily indicate equality of the distribution of outcomes ==== but emphasises the role of individual responsibility in defining a “fair” distribution (Fleurbaey, 2008; Fleurbaey and Schokkaert, 2009, 2012; Ramos and Van de gaer, 2016; Roemer and Trannoy, 2016).====IOp has influenced the policy agenda in recent years (World Bank, 2005; NHS England, 2017) and a growing literature has addressed the measurement of IOp in health (e.g., Fleurbaey and Schokkaert, 2009; Garcia-Gomez et al., 2015; Jones et al., 2012, 2014; Jusot et al., 2013; Li Donni et al., 2014, 2015; Rosa Dias, 2009, 2010; Trannoy et al., 2010). However, many of the existing studies employ subjective self-assessed health (SAH) measures that are inherently categorical and ordinal. This was recently acknowledged by Carrieri and Jones (2018), who propose a semiparametric approach to decompose ==== IOp into the direct contribution of efforts and the direct and indirect contribution of circumstances, using ratio-scaled objectively measured blood-based biomarkers in the Health Survey for England.====The IOp approach aims at disentangling inequalities by circumstances, for which individuals cannot be considered responsible, and efforts, for which individuals should be considered responsible. As will be discussed later, there are two approaches to IOp: the ex-ante and the ex-post approach (eg., Fleurbaey and Schokkaert, 2009; Fleurbaey and Peragine, 2013; Li Donni et al., 2014). The ex post approach seeks equality of outcomes among people who have exerted the same degree of effort, regardless of their circumstances (Roemer, 1998). The ex ante approach to IOp is based on the principle that there is equality of opportunity if all individuals face the same opportunity set, prior to their efforts and outcomes being realised (Fleurbaey and Schokkaert, 2009; Van de Gaer, 1993). The ex-ante approach suggests that all individuals have equal opportunities if (in expectation) no differences in outcomes emerge from having different circumstances. The expectation over outcomes within a circumstances type can be taken with a simple mean (utilitarian reward) or with some inequality aversion (Van de Gaer, 1993; Ooghe and Schokkaert, 2007). In light of the context for UK health policy, in this study we adopt an ex ante approach that focuses on inequality in the distribution of outcomes across social types, defined by their circumstances. We draw on the legal and health policy context to support this approach.====With respect to the UK policy setting, a recent NHS Scotland policy report states that health inequalities go against the principle of social justice because they are avoidable (NHS Health Scotland, 2015). In particular, it is argued that “health inequalities do not occur randomly or by chance, but are socially determined by circumstances largely beyond an individual’s control”. More broadly, NHS England draws on the international definition of health inequalities, as adopted by the World Health Organisation (WHO); health inequalities are defined as avoidable inequalities in health between groups of people within countries and between countries (NHS England, 2017). NHS England laid out the public sector equality duty to reduce health inequalities, which are set out in the Health and Social Care Act 2012. These health inequalities “can cut across a range of social and demographic indicators including socio-economic status, occupation, geographical location and the protected characteristics laid out in the Equality Act 2010” (NHS England, 2017).====These obligations to address health inequalities flow down to specific chronic conditions such as those directly relevant to the biomarker data used in this study; for example, through the Healthier You: NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme that was launched in 2016. Given that diabetes is one of the long-term conditions that may be defined as a disability under the Equality Act 2010, addressing diabetes prevalence is both an equalities issue and a health inequalities issue (NHS England, 2017). In line with the WHO’s targeting of cardio-vascular (CVD) health (WHO, 2007), the recent NHS Long-term Plan highlights timely access to treatment and improving treatment of high-risk conditions including hypertension and high cholesterol, which are linked to CVD disease (NHS, 2019). Cardiovascular conditions are one of these Long-term Plan priorities, being largely preventable, more common in areas of deprivation and a major cause of health ==== (NHS, 2019); the Long-term Plan identifies air pollution, smoking, obesity and poor diet as risk factors for CVD.====Reducing health inequalities is therefore at the centre of the policy agenda (Bleich et al., 2012), with the WHO calling for a global action at different levels of policy making to tackle health inequalities and promote the health of the more vulnerable population groups (Marmot et al., 2012; WHO, 2017). More specifically, in the context of the UK health policy, the guidance for those allocating health care resources at a local level is to ‘…pay particular attention to groups or sections of society where improvements in health and life expectancy are not keeping pace with the rest of the population’ (NHS England, 2015a). In the case of major chronic health conditions that are relevant to this study, such as cardiovascular conditions, diabetes and obesity, these transfers could be achieved through targeting of fiscal, environmental, health promotion and public health policies such as clean air zones, medical control of blood pressure and cholesterol, health education, preventative interventions and taxes on tobacco or sugary drinks (Marmot et al., 2012; NHS England, 2015a; Thomson et al., 2018).====Distributive justice encompasses the fair distribution of health, since health is an important component of well-being and contributes to an individual’s capability to function (Zheng, 2011). The literature discusses the theoretical considerations on how the inequality concept, as initially applied to the income domain, can be transferred to the health domain (e.g., Culyer, 2014; Zheng, 2011). However, one of the major complications of the measurement of health inequality, as opposed to income inequality, is the measurement of health itself (e.g., Costa-Font and Cowell, 2019; Nesson and Robinson, 2019; Zheng, 2011). Most of the social science surveys used to measure (socioeconomic) inequalities in health are limited to SAH measures. SAH measures are qualitative, subjective assessments of individual’s health and are typically ordinal in nature. Several approaches have been introduced to cardinalise SAH facilitating the use of conventional inequality measures, however the cardinalisation methods have been criticised as an important source of bias (Costa Font and Hernández-Quevedo, 2013), with the relevant inequality results being sensitive to the cardinalisation method used (Ziebarth, 2010). Bond and Lang (2019) show that between-individual comparisons of well-being measures are fragile to different cardinalisations of the inherently ordinal data. Another complication with the self-reported measures of health is that they are subject to significant misreporting, with the reporting bias varying systematically with individual’s socioeconomic characteristics, posing significant implications for the robustness of earlier inequality studies (e.g., Bago d’Uva et al., 2008; Dowd and Zajacova, 2010; Jürges, 2007). Availability of ratio scale, continuous, biomarker measures may offer an attractive alternative here.====In this study, we use nationally representative UK data (Understanding Society: the UK Household Longitudinal Study; UKHLS) to provide a comprehensive analysis of ex ante IOp and its underlining sources using objective health indicators. A contribution of our paper is that we are using nurse-collected and blood-based biomarkers that are each directly relevant to diagnosis, monitoring and the clinical management of specific chronic health conditions: obesity, high blood pressure, inflammation, diabetes and high cholesterol. Higher biomarker values indicate the staging or severity of the particular condition of interest. Over and above being objectively measured, our biomarkers are continuous, ratio-scale measures; thus, our inequality analysis does not depend on cardinalising the health outcome of interest. We use each biomarker separately and we also construct a composite score as a proxy measure of the cumulative wear and tear on the body, reflecting how repeated exposures to adverse circumstances (social, economic and environmental stressors) may get “under the skin” (e.g., McEwen, 2015; Seeman et al., 2004; Turner et al., 2016); similar composite health measures are often called allostatic load and have recently been used in health inequalities research (Nesson and Robinson, 2019).====Given our biomarker measures, the IOp analysis in this study should be interpreted in terms of redistribution of the health burden and functioning and, consequently, social welfare with respect to the particular, preventable health condition (and its severity) that is directly relevant to each of our biomarkers.====A key question is whether the Pigou-Dalton principle holds in this case. The original Pigou-Dalton principle states that a mean-preserving income transfer from a richer to a poorer person should increase the sum of social welfare. The intuition behind the Pigou-Dalton transfer principle is not based on income as such but, more broadly, on individuals’ and society’s welfare, which is determined (at least partially) by income. In this utilitarian framework, it has been assumed that utility is an increasing and concave function of income, with diminishing marginal utility of income (Atkinson and Brandolini, 2015; Schwartz and Winship, 1980). For example, taking a dollar away from a richer person and giving it to a poorer person, we decrease the first person's welfare by less than we increase the poorer person's welfare and, thus, we achieve an increase in the total welfare (as the Pigou-Dalton principle assumes). In a parallel concept, assuming that utility is an increasing concave function of good health, we may consider the association between social welfare and elevated, preventable morbidity and mortality risks as reflected in higher biomarker scores. As we will discuss later, medical research shows a positive and typically convex relationship between our biomarker scores and elevated morbidity and mortality. This indicates that a reduction in the spread of the biomarker value by a hypothetical reduction (-δ) in the biomarker score from someone with a high initial biomarker score (i.e., someone with poor health initially and, hence, higher marginal utility of improving health) that is offset by an increase (+δ) in the biomarker score for someone with a low biomarker score (someone who is more healthy initially and hence with lower marginal utility of health), would increase the first persons’ welfare by more than we reduce the healthier person welfare; this is because utility is assumed to be an increasing concave function of health and that the medical evidence suggests that the harm associated with the biomarkers we use tends to be steeper for higher biomarker scores (those in poorer health). Overall, based on the evidence from the clinical literature presented below, we maintain the assumption that the Pigou-Dalton principle holds for our biomarkers and the analysis in our paper.====We use the objective health measures to estimate both absolute measures of the level of IOp and measures that express IOp as a fraction of the overall inequality in our health measures. We adopt the direct ==== parametric approach proposed by Ferreira and Gignoux (2011, 2013). The advantage of the parametric approach is that, unlike nonparametric tests for IOp (e.g., Lefranc et al., 2009; Rosa Dias, 2009), it does not suffer from a curse of dimensionality, due to insufficient sample sizes for social types (groups of people sharing identical circumstances).==== Moreover, even in the presence of unobserved circumstances, our IOp measures can be interpreted as the lower-bound estimates of overall IOp, i.e., of the inequality due to all circumstances, not only those that are observed (Ferreira and Gignoux, 2011).====We decompose the direct ==== measure of IOp in our health measures into its sources. Shapley-decomposition techniques allow us to identify which circumstances are more relevant to shaping IOp in our biomarker measures. Given that age and gender are principal drivers of variations in health, the sample is then split by gender and by age groups to analyse the extent of IOp that is relevant to circumstance variables apart from age or gender and how these inequalities may vary by gender and across the adult lifespan==== .====Finally, we relax the assumption of inequality neutrality within types, that is implied by the conventional parametric approach, and extend the literature on the decomposition of ==== IOp, capitalising on the continuous nature of our health outcomes. We use the recentered influence function (RIF) approach to distributional analysis (Firpo et al., 2009), to explore how the contribution of circumstances may vary across the distribution of biomarkers. Shapley decompositions are implemented at different quantiles of the biomarker distribution to explore the underlying sources of these inequalities, with a particular focus on the right tails, where clinical concerns are typically focused. We again split the sample by gender and by age groups to analyse the contribution of socioeconomic circumstances (apart from age and gender) at different biomarker quantiles, spanning the whole distribution of our health measures.","Ex ante inequality of opportunity in health, decomposition and distributional analysis of biomarkers",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629618309937,23 December 2019,2019,Research Article,256.0

We examine a German schooling reform that increased weekly instruction time and study its effects on stress-related outpatient diagnoses from the universe of health claims data of the German Social ====, it might have adverse effects in terms of additional stress.","Child wellbeing is long on the agenda of both researchers and policy makers (WHO, 2016). Mental health problems, in general, and stress, in particular, are identified as detrimental factors to wellbeing in childhood and adolescents (Bor et al., 2014) with possible negative consequences for later life outcomes (Hughes et al., 2017, Felitti et al., 2019). At the same time mental health problems are increasing among children and adolescents (Collishaw et al., 2004, Collishaw, 2015).====Several studies argue that schooling substantially contributes to the high stress prevalence and stress-related mental health problems. For example, youth suicide rates increase at the beginning of the school year (Lahti et al., 2005, Matsubayashi et al., 2016) and, generally, are higher while school is in session (Hansen and Lang, 2011). Further, there is evidence that academic stress increases suicidal ideation (Ang and Huan, 2006). Although stress in school rarely leads to extreme outcomes, such as (attempted) suicide, students report that school is the biggest stressor in their lives (Elias, 1989, de Anda et al., 2000, Baltimore Center for Adolescent Health, 2006). However, it is unclear which elements of schooling and the schooling system drive the observed patterns.====In this paper, we contribute to the literature on schooling and mental health by investigating the causal effect on stress-related mental health problems of a specific element of the schooling system, namely weekly instruction time. More specifically, we exploit a German schooling reform that substantially increased weekly instruction time. The differential timing of the reform across German states allows us to estimate the causal effect of more weekly instruction time using a difference-in-differences approach. Based on the universe of outpatient diagnoses from health claims data of the German Social Health Insurance system, we find evidence that more instruction time increases stress-related outpatient diagnoses slightly, albeit statistically significantly.====Several empirical studies document associations between schooling and students’ self-reported mental health.==== For instance, Leung et al. (2010) report that high academic pressure is associated with high anxiety levels. Similarly, Löfstedt (2017) finds that increased pressure in school relates to higher rates of psychosomatic symptoms. Freeman et al. (2012) find that a negative school climate correlates with high levels of psychosomatic complaints. Further, Torsheim and Wold (2001) show that somatic symptoms, such as headache, abdominal pain, backache, and dizziness, are common when perceived school-related stress is high. In line with these results are the findings of Ravens-Sieberer et al. (2009), who show that there is a positive relationship between better school perceptions and higher self-assessed health. Other studies focus on associations between specific elements of the schooling system and measures of mental health. For instance, Galloway et al. (2013) document that students are more stressed when they need more time to complete their homework. Similarly, there is evidence that students are more stressed during exam periods (Banks and Smyth, 2015), while the amount of school sport (Jewett et al., 2014) and good teacher–student relationships (Conner et al., 2014) relate to better self-reported measures of mental health.====There is also research on the causal effects of schooling on measures of mental health. For instance, Song (2017) applies a regression discontinuity design in the admission to elite colleges in China and finds that attending an elite college increases self-reported measures of stress. Heissel et al. (2018) provide evidence that cortisol levels, as an indicator of stress, increase during high-stakes testing weeks. King et al. (2014) demonstrate that adolescents in the US receive more stimulant prescriptions during the school year. They further show that states with stricter accountability laws have the largest differences in stimulant prescriptions between school year and summer, which suggests that there is a high level of self-medication in states with less restrictive accountability laws. Results from Bokhari and Schneider (2011) support this claim by showing that stricter accountability laws increase diagnosis and medication for ADHD.==== The studies by Bokhari and Schneider (2011) and King et al. (2014) are most similar to our study regarding the aim to identify causal effects and the focus on more objective health measures that are not self-reported by the individuals. However, while these studies examine differences between school and holiday season and effects of school accountability laws, we focus on the effects of a different element of the schooling system, instruction time. Moreover, these studies look at psychostimulant prescription, we study stress-related diagnoses.====This paper contributes to the existing literature along three dimensions. First, while many previous studies focus on correlations, our difference-in-differences strategy aims to identify causal effects. Second, instead of examining self-reported stress-related mental health problems, we rely on outpatient diagnoses of stress-related diseases and, thus, a more objective measure. Third, we do not look at schooling in general but rather focus on one key feature of the schooling system – weekly instruction time. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Next we provide an overview of the schooling reform we exploit (Section 2).

Many potential pathways may explain the role that education plays in promoting better health. However, many models predict a positive association between education and health because the same observed and unobserved factors that determine educational attainment (e.g. parental socioeconomic position, genetic ability, time and risk preferences) also determine health at birth and the returns to investments in health. For this reason, establishing causality in the education-health relationship has received increasing research attention.====The most prominent strand of the economics literature exploits policy reforms that increased years of education, tracing the effect of these increases on various measures of health and health-related behaviours in adulthood. The most commonly studied reforms increased the minimum school leaving age (ROSLA reforms), progressively introduced in many countries.==== Many of these studies investigated the causal link between education and mortality. Others have examined measures of morbidity including biomarkers for certain chronic health conditions.====The results from this literature, however, are mixed, with considerable disagreement about the extent to which education and health are causally related. Many studies find evidence that the additional year of schooling induced by these reforms drove significant improvements for some health or health-related behaviours (e.g. Arendt, 2005; Lleras-Muney, 2005; Oreopoulos, 2006; Siles, 2009; Powdthavee, 2010; van Kippersluis et al., 2011; Kemptner et al., 2011; Lager and Torssander, 2012; Brunello et al., 2013, 2016; Crespo et al., 2014; Fischer et al., 2013; Fletcher, 2015; Li and Powdthavee, 2015; Davies et al., 2018; Barcellos et al., 2018).==== Other studies, sometimes using the same data but different model specifications or measures of health, report little or no evidence of a causal effect (e.g. Mazumder, 2008; Albouy and Lequien, 2009; Lindeboom et al., 2009; Jürges et al., 2013; Clark and Royer, 2013; Johnston et al., 2015; Siles, 2015; Meghir et al., 2018).==== To add to the confusion, several studies find different results by gender, which are difficult to reconcile with health-related knowledge and Grossman model efficiency-type arguments (e.g. Kemptner et al., 2011; Brunello et al., 2013; Gathmann et al., 2015). Two recent reviews also come to different conclusions. Galama et al. (2018) conclude that there appears to be a causal effect of education on mortality and smoking but not on obesity, but only in some contexts, while Hamad et al. (2018) conclude that education has a causal effect on the majority of health outcomes.====Our contribution is to provide a comprehensive study of the causal link between education and a large set of prevalent chronic health conditions. Chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, arthritis, back and neck pain, and mental health problems are the main cause of poor health and disability in the US (Bauer et al., 2014). Worldwide, the disease burden is shifting away from communicable to non-communicable diseases (Murray et al., 2012) with substantial implications for health care budgets.==== Many chronic conditions result from lifestyle decisions (tobacco use, physical inactivity, excessive alcohol consumption and poor diet), all of which are potentially affected by greater education (e.g. Lim et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2012). Thus understanding whether education is causally linked to these conditions is important. However, there is currently limited robust evidence, arising from considerable variation in empirical specifications, small sample sizes, the birth cohorts examined, and the measurement of health outcomes (Hamad et al., 2018).====We address these issues by applying a consistent modelling approach to information on a wide range of chronic health conditions reported in the largest population-representative survey-based sample available in the UK. We exploit two education reforms that affected large parts of the population. The first is the 1972 raising of the minimum school leaving age from 15 to 16 years.==== It applied to cohorts born in or after September 1957 and affected around 25% of this population. These were individuals who would otherwise have left school at age 15 and so this reform affected the lower end of the educational attainment distribution. The second reform is the large rise in British educational attainment that occurred around 1990. This rise is the outcome of a number of educational policy changes that we describe in more detail in Section 5. These changes allowed more 18-year olds to receive higher education (Devereux and Fan, 2011) and led to around a 1.5-year increase in average years of schooling within one decade. This reform affected individuals born beginning around 1970. It provided opportunities to individuals across a larger part of the educational attainment distribution than the 1972 ROSLA reform.====To derive causal estimates for the 1972 ROSLA reform we use a conservative fuzzy regression discontinuity approach similar to Clark and Royer (2013) with a tight 30-month bandwidth around this reform in order to close down the effect of time-varying changes that affect both education and health. We test robustness to even tighter band-widths. Identification from the second reform is less straightforward but we use a similar estimation strategy to that used by Bedard and Deschênes (2006) in which identification comes from across cohort covariation in education and chronic health conditions. We test the robustness of our results using the approach of Devereux and Fan (2011).====Our large nationally representative sample is from the UK Quarterly Labour Force Survey (QLFS) for 2001–2016. It contains around 5 million observations for those years and provides estimation samples in the relevant birth cohorts of around 360,000 observations for the first, and 425,000 observations for the second, reform. For the first reform, we observe individuals in the relevant birth cohorts between the ages of 41 and 61, of whom 36% report having a chronic health condition. For the second reform, we observe individuals between the ages of 30 and 50, of whom 27% report having a chronic health condition. These large samples, the high rates of chronic conditions and the adulthood age span of the cohorts allow us to also investigate whether the causal effect of education for each reform differs by gender and whether education becomes more protective of health as individuals get older.====The QLFS provides details on 17 different types of chronic health conditions. While some of these conditions have been examined previously with UK data, there is very limited or no evidence available on others. One clear omission is musculoskeletal conditions. After minor illnesses such as the common cold, such conditions are the most common reason for workplace sickness absence, accounting for a quarter (around 34 million) of working days lost in the UK each year (Office for National Statistics (ONS, 2017). Another omission is mental illness, which accounts for 11.5% of working days lost (15.8 million) each year in the UK and is the largest single cause of disability in most developed countries (Friedrich, 2017). While both conditions may cause considerable pain and loss of normal daily functioning, these impacts may not be well reflected in differential mortality rates, and are thus not captured in studies estimating the causal impact of education health using mortality as outcome variable. Our main focus is on the prevalence of any chronic conditions and key groups of conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, musculoskeletal conditions, respiratory diseases, and mental illness, but we also provide estimates separately for the 17 types of morbidities. For several of these other conditions there is also little evidence on the causal impact of education, including common respiratory-related and stomach/digestive conditions and less prevalent conditions relating to sight and hearing.====The QFLS is considerably larger than the two UK data sources commonly used in studies examining education and health, the Health Survey for England (HSE) and the General Household Survey (GHS). Nor is it possible to examine specific conditions using the UK Census data (used by Clark and Royer, 2013) as the Census asks individuals only whether they have a chronic condition, not what condition(s) they have. Two recent studies have examined the impact of the 1972 ROSLA reform using the larger sample available from the UK Biobank (Davies et al., 2018; Barcellos et al., 2018). However, these studies do not consider many of the conditions that we examine and they also use very different model specifications compared to our conservative approach for their main results. A potentially limiting issue with the Biobank data, in comparison with the QLFS, is that it comes from a sample of volunteers, with more educated people being over-sampled. Our contribution over existing UK studies is discussed in detail in Section 2.====Our key findings are that there is a statistically significant negative association between years of education and chronic ill health but the strength of any associations weakens considerably once we apply causal identification techniques. However, even with the largest survey sample available for the UK, the level of precision we can achieve means that we cannot rule out some educational effects, positive or negative. Only for self-reported diabetes, and perhaps cardiovascular disease, do we find statistically significant evidence that an extra year of education has a beneficial effect on health (consistent with Davies et al., 2018). The finding for diabetes is present for both educational reforms, indicating that the effect of education on diabetes is present at different points in the education distribution. It is greater for males than females, but does not appear to increases as people age. Our findings are robust to a large set of tests.====The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 reviews the existing UK evidence on the causal impact of years of education on morbidity outcomes. Section 3 discusses our data. Section 4 presents our empirical approach and the results for the compulsory school reform. In Section 5 we present the results for the education expansion.

This paper studies the role of ","Blood donations are increasingly important for medical procedures (World Health Organization, 2011, Slonim et al., 2014). However, concerns have been raised that the future demand for blood transfusion may not be met, mainly due to the ageing of the general population (Currie et al., 2004, Ali et al., 2010, Volken et al., 2018). Blood bank's shortages often delay certain surgeries, which can increase the costs to the healthcare system later on (Erickson et al., 2008). Even predictable (e.g. seasonal) shortages can affect routine care of clinic patients and a variety of inpatient needs (Beliën and Forcé, 2012). Paying directly for blood donations is generally not considered as a viable means for increasing turnout and is strongly opposed by World Health Organization (2010). Therefore, blood transfusion services largely rely on voluntary donations. This invites the question of how voluntary blood donors can be motivated to increase turnout.====This paper studies spillovers in the propensity to donate within pairs of blood donors who share the same address. In particular, we explore the extent to which such spillovers are driven by motivational complementarities. Similar to the Battle of the Sexes game, motivational complementarities within these pairs of donors could emerge from various mechanisms, such as enjoyment of shared experiences, cost reductions due to shared transportation, image motivation, or peer pressure. Each of these mechanisms shares the feature that the (net) benefit from donating increases for the focal donor if the peer donates. As we show in an analytical example in the Appendix, this creates a motivational complementarity: if one donor becomes more motivated to donate, this also makes the peer more likely to donate. This, in turn, affects the focal donor again, producing a “social multiplier”, akin to a Keynesian consumption multiplier that amplifies the effect of the original intervention.====We use data from the Blood Transfusion Service of the Red Cross in Zurich, Switzerland (BTSRC) on donors who are pre-registered in the same blood drives. This allows us to analyse social interactions among pairs of donors who live at the same street address and are likely to exhibit strong social ties.==== Our sample consists of 5053 pairs of donors who were repeatedly invited to blood drives over the sample period from April 2011 to January 2013, leading to 13,421 pair-observations. All donors received a personalized invitation letter several weeks ahead of the upcoming blood drive and a text message reminder on her cell phone a day before the event.====Identifying spillovers in the propensity to donate within these pairs of donors is difficult, as simply observing a correlation in behavior within them is not necessarily evidence of such spillovers (Manski, 2000, Durlauf, 2002, Graham, 2016). First of all, pairs are endogenously formed. Thus, both donors may share similar characteristics and can be exposed to similar environments affecting their propensity to donate. Furthermore, the presence of spillovers itself creates an endogeneity problem known as the reflection problem (Manski, 1993), as motivational complementarities feed back and forth between the donors.====In order to overcome these challenges, we use a randomized phone call as an instrument. The phone call targets a random subset of donors whose blood type is currently in short supply. All these donors were previously invited to blood drives through the invitation letters and text messages. The phone call reaches them two days before the upcoming blood drive and encourages them to donate by explaining that their blood type is currently in short supply.====The phone call satisfies two properties that make it a valid instrument. First, it directly increases the recipient's propensity to donate (Bruhin et al., 2015). As the phone call is randomized conditional on blood types, it is exogenous to the recipient's baseline propensity to donate and her other characteristics. In addition, it leaves the peer's propensity to donate and characteristics unaffected, unless the donors within the pair interact. It is important to note that the phone call takes place after the invitation letter and before the text message. Thus, it only explicitly conveys the additional information about the scarcity of the particular recipient's blood type. To estimate the spillovers in the propensity to donate, we apply a linear-in-means model (Manski, 1993, Graham and Hahn, 2005) in a bivariate probit specification.==== The empirical model allows us to distinguish the spillovers arising from endogenous social interactions within the pairs from exogenous social interactions and potential correlations in unobservable characteristics that may also affect donations.====We find strong evidence for spillovers in the propensity to donate within the pairs of donors. Calling up the donor raises her propensity to donate by roughly 11 percentage points (over a baseline of roughly 30 percentage points). The phone call also raises her peer's propensity to donate by 5 percentage points. These findings imply that 46% of the motivational impulse spills over to the peer. The finding is robust across different specifications.====In the context of voluntary blood donations, Lacetera et al. (2014a) provide compelling evidence of social interactions taking place among donors. In their setting, they announce to a subset of blood donors that they will be given a stored-value card if they donate blood. Interestingly, they find that a treatment effect also percolates to other donors who were not made aware of the incentives, pointing to the transmission of information about these incentives as the driver of the social interactions.==== In our setting, however, there is no such information about incentives that can be transmitted. The phone call only conveys information about the scarcity of recipient-specific blood types among otherwise equally well-informed donors.====Our setting allows us to test whether the phone call perhaps also transmits information about (i) the scarcity of a particular blood type, or (ii) the blood drive per se, within pairs. First, we examine whether a phone call to a focal donor also affects the peer's propensity to donate if they have incompatible blood types. If it were exclusively the information about the temporary shortage of a specific blood type that is transmitted, the effect should be absent for a peer with an incompatible blood type, or at least significantly weaker: if the peer's blood type is incompatible with the one in short supply, donating her blood does not help to reduce that particular shortage. Therefore, she should not react to the information of the phone call as strongly as a peer with a compatible blood type. However, we find the same effect as the peers with compatible blood types.==== Second, we check whether a phone call to a peer simply serves as a reminder of the blood drive. In this case, the peer's phone call should have less of an effect on the focal donor if the focal donor received a phone call as well. But we find no evidence thereof.====In addition to the testable predictions regarding the peer's behavior, our model also predicts that the focal donor's response to a phone call is amplified by motivational complementarities. Our estimates imply that, in the absence of a peer, the phone call would only raise donations by 7.8 percentage points, instead of the 11 percentage points we observe in our sample. This lower estimate of the effectiveness on an “isolated” donor matches exactly the estimates in Bruhin et al. (2015) on a sample of mostly unconnected donors. Thus, motivational complementarities can account for, both, the impact of the phone call on a peer, and the amplification of the focal donor's response to the phone call.====Spillovers emerging from motivational complementarities lead to a social multiplier that alters the cost-benefit calculations of policy interventions. The estimates of our baseline specification indicate that 46 percent of the initial impulse from the phone call spills over to the peer. In turn, 46 percent of that increase in the peer's motivation spills back to the focal donor, and so on. The resulting feedback loop amplifies the effect of the phone call by ==== for the focal donor, and by ==== for the peer. Overall, the resulting social multiplier is the sum of the two, and corresponds to ====. Even in our strictest specification, we find that 41 percent of the propensity to donate spills over to the peer, yielding a lower-bound multiplier of ====. Thus, spillovers emerging from motivational complementarities raise the effectiveness of policy interventions by 70 to 85 percent. This demonstrates that behavioral interventions have a substantially larger effect when targeted towards pairs instead of isolated donors.==== Moreover, there is no evidence that these spillovers lead to intertemporal substitution. Donors whose peers were called up at the last blood drive do not show any tendency to reduce blood donations in the current drive.====Taking into account the spillovers arising from motivational complementarities is particularly important in the context of voluntary blood donations, where more is not always better. Blood products have a limited shelf life (42–49 days for red blood cells in our sample) and disposal is costly (Garbarino et al., 2017). Hence, accounting for such spillovers should allow blood transfusion services to better align supply with demand.====Apart from the literature on blood donation cited earlier, our study also contributes to the broader literature on identifying endogenous social interaction and highlights the importance of social multipliers in various contexts. For example, Cipollone and Rosolia (2007) find strong social interactions within high schools, where an increment in the boys’ graduation rate leads to an increase in the girls’ graduation rate. Similarly, Lalive and Cattaneo (2009) conclude that when a child stays longer in school, his friends stay longer too. Borjas and Doran (2015) discover strong knowledge spillovers in collaboration spaces when high-quality researchers directly engage with other researchers in the joint production of new knowledge. Finally, Kessler (2013) shows in an experimental study that subjects making non-binding announcements of their contributions to a public good motivate other subjects to contribute as well.====The paper is organized as follows.

These concerns are particularly policy relevant when participation is deemed to substantially improve outcomes of interest (e.g. Currie and Gruber, 1996a, Joyce et al., 2008).====In this paper, we study the effect of informal networks on program participation at a very fine neighborhood level. We focus on the case of Medicaid participation among pregnant mothers in California. Our main research question explores whether a pregnant mother is more likely to participate in a welfare program if recent mothers in her immediate neighborhood received benefits from these programs. Previous work has established that a lack of knowledge about welfare programs can impede participation (Heckman and Smith, 2004, Stuber et al., 2000). Therefore, potential information flows within neighborhood networks among pregnant mothers may manifest as spillovers in program take-up. Such network effects are even more salient if they encourage expectant mothers to sign up early on during pregnancy to use publicly funded prenatal care, which may improve birth outcomes (Conway and Deb, 2005).====Recently, Dahl et al. (2014) presented evidence of significant peer effects in paternity leave participation in Norway using a regression discontinuity framework. Most previous literature, on the other hand, has largely focused on peer formation based on ethno-linguistic ties and similarly finds that peer effects positively impact program participation (Figlio et al., 2015, Aizer and Currie, 2004, Bertrand et al., 2000). However, due to standard concerns regarding endogenous sorting into peer groups, causality has been hard to establish. As Blume et al. (2010), Durlauf (2004) discuss, adequately dealing with concerns of individuals sorting to particular neighborhood or networks is the biggest impediment in estimating peer effects in a causal framework.==== Using data at a very fine geographic level and the identification ideas established in Bayer et al. (2008), this paper estimates the effects of local networks on Medicaid program participation by isolating variation with-in small neighborhood networks. We present a series of checks and falsification tests to explore the robustness of our findings.====Our identification strategy explores how likely a mother is to take up Medicaid if a recent mother who resides in her immediate neighborhood, defined as a census block, also took up Medicaid during her pregnancy, conditional on a broader neighborhood fixed effect. We use two alternative definitions of these broad neighborhoods/reference groups: census block group and the 10 closest census blocks to the immediate neighborhood (census block) of interest.==== The key identification idea exploited by Bayer et al. (2008) to estimate causal network effects is the thinness of housing markets at the census block level as opposed to larger geographic entities like block groups or census tracts. In particular, this implies that even in the presence of endogenous sorting, individuals would not be able to make an exact locational choice down to a specific census block. Therefore, conditional on a census block group fixed effect, informal networks of other pregnant mothers residing on a specific census block is likely to induce idiosyncratic variation in peer groups. We explore how effective our approach is in isolating plausibly exogenous variation in neighborhood networks by studying sorting in key observable individual characteristics conditional on the reference group fixed effect, finding support for this in Section 3.3.====A second key concern in the estimation of peer effects is the so-called reflection problem (Manski, 1993), which reference group fixed effects would not resolve. We avoid this problem by defining the peer group of a currently pregnant mother as all mothers residing on the same census block who gave birth within 6 months of the conception of our currently pregnant mother.==== While it is possible that network effects can operate between contemporaneously pregnant mothers, it is more likely that information about program participation flows from mothers who have already given birth to mothers who are still currently pregnant.==== A related concern is that mothers could be coming in and out of Medicaid enrollment across births, which can potentially end up creating an inter-temporal reflection problem. Hence, to account for this concern our primary analysis only focuses on those mothers who are giving birth to their first child.====Our results indicate the presence of significant peer effects at the census block level in Medicaid participation. Following Bayer et al. (2008) we construct our estimation sample such that each distinct observation is a matched pair of a currently pregnant mother in a given reference group and a recent mother who has successfully given birth in the same reference group. The relevant comparison of interest then becomes between mothers that reside on the same census block as opposed to those that reside in the same census block group but not on the exact same census block. Results show that a currently pregnant mother is around 3 percentage points (pp) more likely to be enrolled in Medicaid if a matched mother on her census block also participated in these programs during her pregnancy. This is equivalent to approximately an 8 percent increase relative to her reference group specific average participation in Medicaid. We also document that among mothers who participate in Medicaid, neighborhood networks also encourage earlier and prolonged participation in prenatal care.====Another major concern in the causal estimation of peer effects is the presence of correlated effects. For instance, similar census block level unobservable shocks can be correlated with peer formation and program participation spuriously manifesting as peer effects. Two features of our setup likely allay such concerns. First, the geographic definition of our immediate neighborhood or peer group is very fine: a square residential block with roads on all four sides. Since we exploit within census block group variation, mothers living on all census blocks other than the census block of our mother of interest in the same block group form the ‘control’ group. Therefore, for our estimates to be nullified the unobservable shocks would have to vary from block to block in the same block group.====Second, a major geographic and time specific unobservable that could complicate inference is characteristics of the hospitals in which mothers in our sample gave birth. For instance, if mothers living on the same block are more likely to visit the same hospital which then directs them into Medicaid, then we might partially be capturing a hospital effect as well.==== An alternative interpretation is that going to the same hospital can actually be a mechanism through which peer effects operate, i.e. previously pregnant mothers recommending current mother to the hospital that introduced them to Medicaid. In our data, we observe a hospital identifier for each birth and hence control for the hospital of birth to account for the above concerns.====The literature on estimating peer and network effects is large and expansive. Researchers have explored their existence in such diverse settings from academic achievement in the classroom (e.g. Zimmerman, 2003) to criminal behavior among juvenile offenders (Bayer et al., 2009). Identification strategies similar to ours have largely been applied in a labor market setting exploring hiring decisions by employers and job referrals among potential employees (see e.g. Bayer et al., 2008, Kramarz and Skans, 2014, Schmutte, 2015). As cited above, researchers have explored peer effects in program participation as well, and have largely found positive effects on take up. Bauer and Dang (2016) use an instrumental variable strategy to assess neighborhood effects at the zip-code level on German data, finding that neighbor welfare use leads to increased own welfare receipt. Using quasi-experimental variation, Åslund and Fredriksson (2009) show the existence of peer effects in welfare take up among a refugee sample in Sweden, while Markussen and Røed (2015) find that social insurance claims are contagious with effects being particularly strong among geographically and relationally closer peers.====Examining the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), Chetty et al. (2013) documents the existence of substantial differences in local knowledge of program rules. Their results suggest a role for information dissemination in low knowledge neighborhoods, with the objective of increasing program participation among the eligible population. In Section 5.1, we repeat our analysis by within sample deciles of the Chetty measure of neighborhood knowledge of EITC. Although knowledge of EITC rules is not likely to be a perfect proxy of knowledge of programs, like Medicaid, given that the former is targeted primarily at working families and the latter has no such restriction. Nevertheless, we expect that there will still be substantial correlation between the information sets of the eligible population of both programs.==== Results show that areas with the lowest rates of program knowledge actually have the highest network effect rates relative to the baseline rate of participation, providing suggestive evidence that information dissemination policy interventions can lead to an increase in program participation.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents background information on the Medicaid program, reviews relevant Medicaid literature, and describes our data set. Section 3 then presents our empirical methodology and discusses in detail potential identification threats and our solutions for them. Section 4 presents our main results on the existence of peer effects in program participation at a very fine neighborhood level, a census block. Section 5 provides suggestive evidence of the role of information dissemination on Medicaid participation and on encouraging healthier behavior on the part of the mother during pregnancy.

Additionally, we find consistent evidence that cannabis access laws have different effects across types of providers, physician specialties, and payers.","As health care providers began to recognize pain as a “fifth vital sign” and began to treat it more aggressively, the number of opioid prescriptions quadrupled in the first fifteen years of the new millennium (Dart et al., 2015; Merboth and Barnason, 2000; Rudd et al., 2016; Tompkins et al., 2017; Von Korff and Franklin, 2016). Opioids are used to treat both chronic and acute pain, though their efficacy in treating chronic, non-cancer pain is limited (Boudreau et al., 2009; Chou et al., 2015, 2009). However, as prescription opioid use increased, so did opioid-related mortality, leading to the ongoing opioid crisis (Mattson et al., 2017; Pacula and Powell, 2018). While state governments have enacted various policies to curtail opioid prescriptions, e.g., prescription drug monitoring programs, many of these policies simply limit access to opioids and may push individuals already dependent on prescription opioids to more dangerous drugs, such as heroin. Thus, policies that reduce opioid prescriptions without leading individuals to substitute more dangerous drugs may be preferable to policies that simply restrict opioid prescriptions.====One policy option that has the potential to reduce opioid prescriptions and opioid-related deaths is the passage of cannabis access laws. These state laws facilitate access to cannabis by removing state legal barriers—though possession of cannabis remains illegal under federal law. Recreational cannabis laws (RCLs) allow adults over 21 to possess and consume a limited amount of cannabis. Medical cannabis laws (MCLs) allow patients with eligible conditions, which are listed in the law and often include some form of intractable pain, to obtain cannabis upon the recommendation or certification of a healthcare provider.====The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine concluded after a comprehensive review of the clinical literature that “[t]here is conclusive. . . evidence that cannabis. . . [is] effective. . . [f]or the treatment of chronic pain in adults,” i.e., the condition that was one of the motivating factors behind the initial increase in opioid prescriptions (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2017). Similarly, conducting a meta-analysis of the clinical literature, Whiting et al. (2015) find evidence that cannabis is effective in the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain and cancer pain. And clinical evidence suggests that cannabis can effectively substitute for opioids in the treatment of pain. For example, Haroutounian et al. (2016) examine the effect of cannabis treatment on pain and functional outcomes of 274 participants and finds statistically significant improvements in various measures of pain and a 44 percent decrease in opioid consumption.====Given the ability of cannabis to substitute for opioids in the treatment of pain and the more moderate side effects associated with cannabis relative to opioids, several studies have examined the potential of RCLs and MCLs to reduce opioid consumption and ameliorate the ongoing opioid crisis. For example, Bradford et al. (2018) find that opioid use among Medicare beneficiaries declines by 8.5 percent following the passage of an MCL. Examining state-level Medicaid data, Wen and Hockenberry (2018) conclude that MCLs and RCLs reduce opioid prescribing by 5.9 percent and 6.4 percent, respectively. While these and other studies provide important evidence on the potential of cannabis access laws to reduce opioid use, prior work has generally been limited to examining specific populations (such as Medicaid or Medicare beneficiaries), survey evidence, and outcomes defined at the state level.====We extended the scope of the results in the existing literature by analyzing a dataset of over 1.5 billion individual opioid prescriptions, which represent approximately 90 percent of all prescription opioids filled by outpatient pharmacies over the time period we examine. We aggregate these prescription data to the individual-provider level and calculate highly specific measures of opioid prescriptions, including morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs), to examine changes in provider opioid prescribing patterns caused by cannabis access laws. Thus, we examine the effect of RCLs and MCLs using more granular information and more specific measures of prescribing behavior than has previously been available. Additionally, because we observe prescriptions at the provider level, we are able to analyze changes in opioid prescribing across different types of providers controlling for provider-specific fixed effects. We also explore differences by physician specialties and by the payer responsible for patients’ prescriptions.====In general, we find consistent evidence that both RCLs and MCLs reduce the use of prescription opioids. These laws reduce the amount of annual MMEs prescribed by individual providers by 11.8 and 4.2 percent, respectively. However, our results are not unique to the MME measure of opioid prescriptions, and both types of cannabis access laws similarly reduce the total days’ supply of opioids, the number of patients to whom providers prescribe opioids, and the probability that a provider prescribes any opioids.====Interestingly, while we find evidence that RCLs and MCLs reduce opioid use across a wide array of medical (and other) specialties, the magnitude of this reduction is not uniform across specialties. RCLs and MCLs reduce the MMEs prescribed by the five largest physician specialties (in terms of practitioners) by 10.6 percent and 2 percent, respectively. The five specialties that have the highest prescribing rates, as measured by MMEs, reduce their opioid use by 28.3 percent when an RCL is passed and 6.9 percent when an MCL is passed. Similarly, the impact of RCLs and MCLs differs by the patient’s payer. RCLs and MCLs reduce opioid prescriptions to those covered by commercial insurance, Medicare, and government assistance programs. However, the results for the effect of RCLs and MCLs on opioid prescriptions to Medicaid and cash-paying patients are more mixed.====The evidence reported here presents the most accurate picture of the effect of cannabis access laws on prescription opioid use to date and can therefore inform the ongoing state and national debates over the legality of cannabis as well as other policy options to combat the opioid epidemic. Our analysis of a comprehensive national database on a diverse set of measures of opioid use provides an estimate of the overall net impact of cannabis laws. There has been some concern in the literature that cannabis may serve as a “gateway” drug and eventually increase the use of opioids (Secades-Villa et al., 2015; Wilkinson et al., 2016), though recent empirical work found no evidence that cocaine and heroin usage increase following the passage of MCLs (Chu, 2015). While there may be a gateway effect for some individuals, our results take any such offsetting impacts into account. On balance, cannabis access laws reduce overall opioid usage measured by total MMEs, total days of opioid supply, number of opioid patients, and whether the provider prescribed opioids. By analyzing data at the provider level and estimating separate effects by specialty, our results also provide policymakers with information on how to target policies to have the most impact.",The impact of cannabis access laws on opioid prescribing,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629618309020,14 December 2019,2019,Research Article,261.0

The ambulatory care sector in Germany provides primary care for 82 million people and employs around 130,000 physicians (Simon, 2010). The average utilization of ambulatory care varies greatly between German regions (Eibich and Ziebarth, 2014a; Kopetsch and Schmitz, 2014). Average utilization is around 30 % higher in the state with the highest utilization (Hamburg) than in the state with the lowest utilization (Brandenburg). Large regional disparities in healthcare utilization have also been documented for many other countries and for other types of care (see surveys by Chandra et al., 2012 and Skinner, 2012).====Those disparities can have many causes. These include for example differences between regions in patients’ health (Eibich and Ziebarth, 2014b) and differences in physician density (Jürges and Pohl, 2012). Broadly speaking, causes of variation can be divided into two categories: factors that can be attributed to patients and factors that can be attributed to regional characteristics. The first category includes e.g. differences in patients’ health and preferences whereas the second category comprises e.g. differences in the number and specialization of outpatient physicians, available equipment, and physicians’ beliefs about effective treatments, but also the local climate and local economic conditions. As a shorthand, we refer to the first category as “demand” factors and to the second category as “supply” factors.====Our study’s aim is to examine the relative importance of “demand” and “supply” factors as causes of regional variation in ambulatory care use in Germany. Disentangling the effects of “demand” factors and “supply” factors is challenging since for example a higher physician density in some regions might also reflect higher unobserved healthcare needs. One approach to disentangle the effects of environmental factors (e.g. regional characteristics) from the effects of personal characteristics is to follow individuals who migrate between different environments.==== Finkelstein et al. (2016) apply this approach to separate regional variation in healthcare utilization attributable to patients from regional variation attributable to regional characteristics for Medicare patients in the United States. In our study, we follow their approach, and we expand on it.====We use administrative claim-level data from a group of social health insurers in Germany (Betriebskrankenkassen). Our data include observations of around 6.3 million patients of age 18+ for the period 2006–2012. We find that regional variation in ambulatory care use in Germany can be overwhelmingly explained by patient characteristics. In our baseline specification more than 90 percent of regional variation in log utilization can be attributed to “demand” factors, while less than 10 percent of regional variation can be attributed to “supply” factors. This finding holds for healthcare utilization at both the intensive and extensive margin, and for alternative specifications of the sample, and we obtain similar findings for two alternative empirical approaches based on either an event study analysis or a decomposition analysis. The “supply” share is larger for specialist care, for patients in the highest percentiles of the distribution of care utilization, and for a specification where care utilization is measured in levels instead of logs. Yet, also for these specifications “demand” factors account for the largest part of regional variation in ambulatory care use in Germany.====Our study makes three main contributions to the literature. First, we examine causes of regional variation in healthcare utilization in Germany, and we find that the share of regional variation that can be attributed to “demand” and “supply” factors, respectively, is very different for ambulatory care utilization in Germany compared to other countries. Finkelstein et al. (2016) find that around 50 % of regional variation in Medicare use can be explained by “demand” factors and the remaining 50 % by “supply” factors.==== Cutler et al. (2019) find that differences in physician beliefs and practice styles are an important cause of regional variation in the United States. Moura et al. (2019) find that the “demand” share in the Netherlands is around 70 %, which is lower than in Germany, but higher than in the United States.====Thus, the share of regional variation attributed to “demand” factors is much higher for ambulatory care in Germany than for other healthcare systems that have been previously examined. This might be related to planning restrictions and other institutional rules of ambulatory care in Germany that are very different from the United States and the Netherlands. Ambulatory care in Germany is an interesting example for an institutional setting that combines strong restrictions on the supply of services with few restrictions on the demand for services. For instance, the maximum number of physicians’ practices in an area is restricted, and physicians receive deductions on payment if they provide too much treatment. There are also incentives for physicians to practice in underserved areas. On the other hand, patients have free choice of physicians, they can access specialists without a referral from a General Practitioner, co-payments are low, and waiting times and travel times tend to be short. The somewhat higher “supply” share for specialist care and for patients at the highest percentiles of the care distribution could be related to a lack of coordination in the treatment of patients with complex demands (Amelung et al., 2012; Sundmacher et al., 2015).====Second, we expand on the approach by Finkelstein et al. (2016) and Moura et al. (2019) by having a closer look at the components of the “demand” share. We decompose the “demand” share in two parts: the one which can be attributed to differences in the age and gender composition between regions and the share that can be attributed to other factors remaining unobserved in our study. We also examine the distribution of these components and how they are related with regional characteristics. In our baseline specification, we find that patient characteristics other than demographics account for around 50 % of total regional variation in ambulatory care in Germany. These characteristics can reflect regional tastes or preferences for outpatient care, and they are positively correlated with lower unemployment, urban regions, and regions in West Germany.====The previous literature on causes of regional variation in healthcare use in Germany is limited to studies explaining the contribution of observed patient characteristics such as age and gender and observed regional characteristics such as physician density (Eibich and Ziebarth, 2014a; Kopetsch and Schmitz, 2014; Ozegowski and Sundmacher, 2014). Together these factors can account for around 60 % of regional variation in ambulatory care use in Germany (Kopetsch and Schmitz, 2014). An important advantage of our estimation strategy based on patient migration compared to previous German studies is that we can also account for unobserved patient characteristics such as preferences for healthcare use, and we find that unobserved patient characteristics are one of the main determinants of regional variation.====Third, we examine how the relative importance of patient and regional characteristics varies with the regions we compare. We alternatively compare regions with large differences in physician density, the share of the elderly in the population, and regions in West and East Germany (the former German Democratic Republic) which arguably still exhibit large cultural differences. We find that the shares attributable to different causes vary widely with the regions we compare. However, for all specifications, “demand” factors account for the largest part of variation.====Our findings have important policy implications. Policymakers in Germany are keenly aware of large differences in healthcare utilization between regions. Recent law changes aim at reducing those differences with stronger incentives to open a physician’s practice in areas with low utilization and further restrictions on opening practices in areas with high utilization (GKV-Versorgungsstärkungsgesetz, 2015). These policy changes are motivated by widespread concerns about lack of access to ambulatory care in rural regions with aging populations (Sachverständigenrat, 2014). Our study contributes to this debate by showing that regional differences in ambulatory care use can for the most part be explained by “demand” factors rather than “supply” factors. Lower healthcare utilization in regions such as Brandenburg can mainly be explained by patients’ health and preferences, and not by a lack of access to care. However, this does not preclude that supply constraints might become more binding in the future if the provision of outpatient services in rural regions does not keep up with the needs of an aging population. “Supply” factors are also more important for specialist treatment and for patients with complex demands.====This study continues as follows.

Private costs associated with teen childbearing include lower levels of educational attainment by teen mothers as well as diminished labor market outcomes like lower labor force participation and lower wages, while plausibly external costs include greater dependence on welfare programs and an increased need for remedial school services (c.f., Hofferth, 1987; Hoffman et al., 1993; Klepinger et al., 1999; Chevalier and Viitanen, 2003). Beyond maternal costs, children born to teen mothers are more likely to experience reduced life chances due to poor school performance, greater substance abuse and an increased propensity to engage in criminal activity (c.f., Bronars and Grogger, 1994; Grogger, 1997; Francesconi, 2008). While it is not clear that such associations are causal in nature, it seems likely that at least some of the negative consequences associated with teen fertility are indeed causal. To the extent that they are, policies that reduce teen fertility can improve the well-being of women who are predominantly considered disadvantaged relative to the general population.====Despite this possibility, there exists relatively little research on the possible causal effect of schooling on teen childbearing. Indeed, while there is much descriptive evidence that less-educated women are more likely to give birth as teens, there is considerably less credible evidence that this relationship is causal in nature. We investigate the causal relationship between educational attainment and teen childbearing for a large sample of women drawn from multiple waves of the Canadian Census. More precisely, we exploit variation in compulsory schooling laws (CSLs) in an instrumental variables framework to identify the impact of schooling on fertility as a teenager. While prior studies have been hampered by weak instruments, our estimates are unique in the literature because they imply a strong first stage relationship. In turn, we find that CSL-induced schooling reduces the probability of giving birth as a teenager by between two to three percentage points, which is proportionally substantial.==== We also explore possible mechanisms underlying this relationship by examining the ==== of our estimates as it relates to age of first birth. We find evidence that education affects the timing of births in a way that suggests the existence of an “incarceration” effect. In particular, we find large negative impacts of education on births to young women aged seventeen and eighteen, but less systematic evidence of an effect after these ages. While our findings are consistent with the idea that being enrolled in school deters fertility in a contemporaneous manner (i.e., an “incarceration effect”) we cannot rule out longer-run effects of CSL-induced education on fertility. We also examine teen fertility on the intensive margin and find estimates consistent with this overall interpretation.====To address a recent critique of the broader CSL literature by Stephens and Yang (2014), we also include controls for school quality in our models, in addition to other province-level characteristics. Our main estimates are quite robust to their inclusion. To the extent that avoiding a teen birth leads to improved life outcomes, our findings suggest that policies which attempt to increase educational attainment at the lower end of the distribution may have substantial non-pecuniary returns, at least in this dimension.====In the following section, we provide background information on Canadian compulsory school laws, discuss mechanisms by which schooling may affect teen fertility decisions and review related literature. Section 3 describes our data, focusing on key definitions such as how we label teen mothers, and also the relevant history of minimum school leaving ages which provide the variation which we use to identify the impact of schooling on teen fertility. Section 4 presents our empirical strategy which relies on instrumental variables estimation. We also discuss issues surrounding appropriate variance estimation when there are few clusters or sources of independent variation. Since CSLs are a matter of provincial policy and since there are only ten Canadian provinces, we implement the Wild cluster bootstrap procedure outlined in Cameron and Miller (2015).

Using the Health and Retirement Study matched to administrative records, I examine how disability benefits affect family support by comparing accepted and rejected disability applicants before and after benefit receipt. Receipt of disability insurance increases the probability of receiving any assistance from children by 18 percent and more than doubles the amount of in-kind assistance. Disability insurance also increases the probability that children are paid for their help and reduces children's labor supply. These findings are largest for low-income beneficiaries and those who recently lost a spouse, suggesting that child assistance complements income provided by disability insurance, and substitutes for other family assistance. Receipt of disability benefits allows the family to re-optimize how they provide support, and disability insurance is shared within the family in complementary ways.","Chronic disability leads to significant health needs, limits an individual's ability to live independently, and lowers an individual's income and consumption over a long period of time (Ball and Low, 2014, Meyer and Mok, 2018). Individuals facing disability draw upon a variety of formal and informal sources of support (Dalton and LaFave, 2017, Meyer and Mok, 2018). While the main insurance sources for individuals with disability are broadly understood, less is known about the ways that family support mechanisms interact and change over the evolution of the disability and in particular, how they interact with federal disability benefits. In this paper, I present a careful analysis of these interactions.====I examine interactions between the main federal disability programs, Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and informal in-kind and monetary assistance provided by potential beneficiaries’ children. I use the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) matched to administrative earnings and benefit records from the Social Security Administration (SSA) to examine trends in income and child assistance before and after the onset of disability. Then, I identify the extent to which the receipt of federal disability benefits changes these patterns. Using the HRS panel to separate the onset of the health shock from the receipt of disability insurance, I compare a propensity score-weighted sample of accepted and rejected disability applicants before and after receipt of disability benefits.====The SSA administrative data records on disability applications, benefit receipt and earnings provide a complete and accurate sample of accepted and rejected disability applicants, minimizing the concerns of measurement error, recall bias or potential inconsistencies in reporting the timing or receipt of benefits in survey data. However, administrative data alone does not provide a complete picture of outside income sources, health or family support, which is needed to fully understand the impact of disability benefits on an individual's health and livelihood. I thus link the administrative data from SSA to the rich, longitudinal data in the HRS, capturing information about the individual's income, health and informal transfers from the family to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the impact of disability benefits on both the beneficiary and the family.====I find that receipt of federal disability insurance, in particular SSI, crowds ==== assistance from children. Receipt of SSI increases the probability that a beneficiary receives any transfer from their children by 9 percentage points, which corresponds to a change of 18 percent relative to the overall sample mean. This effect is driven by an increase in in-kind assistance on both the extensive and intensive margins, doubling the number of hours and days of help provided per month. Receipt of SSDI does not significantly increase the provision of in-kind assistance from children, nor does it increase the probability of a monetary transfer on the extensive margin. However, I find that receipt of SSDI increases monetary transfers from children on the intensive margin, doubling the amount of monetary assistance (a monetary value of approximately $200 per survey wave). I also analyze the impacts of disability insurance on spousal labor supply among beneficiaries who are always married and find that receipt of SSDI crowds out spousal labor supply among consistently married beneficiaries, reducing the probability that the spouse works by 12 percent.====I find that the crowd in of in-kind and monetary support occurs mainly for beneficiaries who recently experienced a change in marital status, either due to divorce or spouse death. This context suggests that children step in to fill some of the gap in support left by the spouse: the increase in in-kind assistance complements the income support provided by SSI and replaces the in-kind assistance formerly provided by the spouse. In additional analyses, I confirm that these findings are not driven by potential endogeneity of marital status, or by child assistance in response to the changes in marital status.====Research in economics and sociology finds that family transfers are motivated by a variety of factors, including familial expectation and obligation (Cox and Soldo, 2013), or exchange motives (Cox, 1987). Receipt of disability insurance could provide external validation of a parent's need that instigates additional support from children, and these needs may be particularly salient in households that have recently experienced other significant changes. Additionally, the influx of resources through disability insurance could enable children to provide care that they previously could not afford to provide, particularly in lower income households that receive SSI. I find receipt of SSI more than doubles the probability that children are paid for their help, and leads to a 50 percent decline in the probability that the assisting children work full time. The resources from disability insurance are thus exchanged within the family, allowing children to re-allocate their time to caring for their parents.====This work brings together several perspectives on household adjustments in response to a major health shock in the U.S. (e.g., Cullen and Gruber, 2000, Coile, 2004, Fadlon and Nielsen, 2018, Dalton and LaFave, 2017), and abroad (e.g., Ball and Low, 2014, Autor et al., 2019, Gertler and Gruber, 2002, Liu, 2016, Jeon and Pohl, 2017). This literature broadly concludes that the family plays a key role in insuring against significant health shocks (e.g., Low and Pistaferri, 2015, Blundell et al., 2016, McGarry, 2016), and that informal and formal assistance are likely imperfect substitutes for one another (Ball and Low, 2014). While Autor et al. (2019) and Ball and Low (2014) find evidence of substitutions between social benefits, spousal labor supply and disability insurance in Europe, relatively little is known in the U.S. setting about the role of children, and how it interacts with formal support. Furthermore, given that the children of disability beneficiaries tend to live in a separate household from their parents, this research also sheds light on the potential for the impact of disability – and potential benefits of federal assistance – to spill over from one household to another.====The size of the caregiver population is large and growing in the U.S., meaning the need to understand these potential interactions between benefits and caregiving is growing as well. In 2011, nearly 15 million caregivers in the United States cared for nearly 8 million older adults, and these caregivers were found more likely to experience emotional, physical and financial difficulties compared to non-caregivers (Wolff et al., 2016). The expected aging of the population implies that the number of caregivers, and their commensurate unmet needs, is likely to grow in the coming years. A robust body of literature examines how the role of the family interacts with long term care insurance (e.g., McGarry, 1998, Stabile et al., 2006, Pezzin et al., 2006, McKnight, 2006, Mommaerts, 2018), but tends to focus on the population over 65. I provide evidence of the importance of the family's role in caring for individuals who experience health shocks earlier in life – prior to the full retirement age. Disability beneficiaries are at a different stage in the life cycle with a different family structure, less time to accumulate assets and savings prior to disability, and eligibility for different public benefits. Because these beneficiaries are younger, they will likely draw upon these various support mechanisms – including assistance from families – for a longer period of time relative to their older counterparts, putting additional strain on the families and services that support them.====My results show that the benefits of disability insurance are shared in complementary ways within the family, enabling a more holistic network of both formal and informal support. While the crowd out of spousal labor supply suggests that married households are generally able to shoulder the burden of the disabling event, the combined increase in assistance provided by disability benefits and children highlights the extent of need for individuals with severe health conditions who cannot rely upon spousal support. These impacts are particularly large for SSI beneficiaries, demonstrating that interactions between family and government support are of particular importance for lower income individuals who are more likely to utilize both forms of insurance. While I find that federal benefits may offset some of the children's costs of providing this additional support, more attention needs to be paid to the role of the family in shouldering the burden of significant health shocks. At the same time, these findings highlight the crucial role that federal disability benefits play in insuring individuals who cannot draw upon a family network for alternative sources of support.","A double safety net?

Professor St., Oberlin, OH 44074, USA","Received 6 November 2017, Revised 19 December 2018, Accepted 3 November 2019, Available online 18 November 2019, Version of Record 13 December 2019.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2019.102255,Cited by (3),. These results suggest that the paradox of low birth weight remains even after controlling for unobserved maternal heterogeneity.,"In the United States, 8% of infants are born low birth weight (LBW) or less than 2.5⬯kg, accounting for 321,000 births annually. Approximately 1.4% are very low birth weight (VLBW) or less than 1.5⬯kg (CDC, 2017). The problem of low birth weight may be worsening, as birth weights in the United States declined from 1990 to 2005 (Donahue et al., 2010). Low birth weight infants are at a higher risk of infant mortality and morbidity, although there is debate as to how much of this relationship is causal (McCormick, 1985).====Low birth weight may be correlated with infant health even in the absence of a strong causal effect if both low birth weight and other measures of infant health are determined by a third factor, such as maternal behaviors (e.g., smoking, nutrition, or bed rest) or socioeconomic status (Abrevaya and Dahl, 2008, Durrance and Guldi, 2015). To overcome these challenges, many studies use twin designs, most notably Almond et al. (2005). Twin designs allow for the inclusion of birth-set fixed effects, which will control for any characteristics of the pregnancy that affect both infants within the set. Such estimates are not confounded by smoking behavior, maternal nutrition, or socioeconomic status. Although genetics may be correlated with birth weight, this can be controlled for by generating estimates for identical twins as in Conley et al. (2006) and Behrman and Rosenzweig (2004).====A separate literature in epidemiology has questioned whether birth weight causally affects mortality by documenting what is sometimes referred to as the paradox of low birth weight: groups with smaller birth weights have higher infant mortality rates, but LBW infants in the smaller birth weight group often have lower mortality than LBW infants from the heavier group (Wilcox, 2001). This effect has been documented by looking at blacks (Joseph et al., 2004), twins (Joseph et al., 2003, Buekens and Wilcox, 1993), and the children of smoking mothers (Hernandez-Diaz et al., 2006). This literature has largely been descriptive, and I am unaware of any studies on the paradox of low birth weight that control for unobserved maternal heterogeneity.====In this study, I estimate how the effect of birth weight varies with plurality using data from the universe of multiple births linked to infant death records in the United States from 1995 to 2000. This is the first study to my knowledge to use data from triplets and quadruplets, in addition to twins, to control for unobserved maternal characteristics. I find that low birth weights increase infant mortality and decrease Apgar scores for twins, triplets, and quadruplets. Although triplets are more likely to be LBW, triplets experience smaller reductions in infant health when they are LBW. This finding is true for one-year mortality, one-day mortality, neonatal mortality, and 5-minute Apgar scores. For all measures of mortality, quadruplets are less affected by LBW than twins are, although I do not find differences for Apgar scores. In addition to the fixed-effects model, I present cross-sectional estimates of the effect of birth weight on infant health for singletons, twins, and triplets using a rich set of controls using both modern and historical data (when in vitro fertilization was in its infancy). These estimates are consistent with births from higher pluralities experiencing smaller reductions in health when they are low birth weight. Taken together, these results are at least suggestive that LBW singletons may experience somewhat larger reductions in infant health than twins studies would suggest.====In addition to infant health, twin designs have been used to estimate the relationship between birth weight and a variety of medium- and long-run outcomes. For example, studies have provided evidence that within-twin differences in birth weight predict test scores in Florida (Figlio et al., 2014); educational attainment in California (Royer, 2009); height, educational attainment, IQ, and earnings in Norway (Black et al., 2007); and high school completion and welfare enrollment in Canada (Oreopoulos et al., 2008).==== Oreopoulos et al. (2008) find that a twin fixed-effects model yields smaller estimates of the effect of LBW on infant mortality compared to a sibling fixed-effects model, whereas Figlio et al. (2014) find that a twin fixed-effects model yields larger estimates on test scores than a siblings fixed-effects model.==== For a more thorough review of the literature on the effects of birth weight on later outcomes, see Torche and Conley (2016).====This paper also contributes to the larger literature that uses twin differences to infer population parameters for singletons. Many studies use twin differences in educational attainment to estimate the returns to an additional year of schooling (Ashenfelter and Krueger, 1994, Ashenfelter and Rouse, 1998). Twins have lower IQ than singletons (Webbink et al., 2008, Ronalds et al., 2005); if the returns to schooling are dependent on IQ, then within-twin differences in schooling may provide credible estimates of the returns to schooling for twins, but may be biased estimates for the returns to schooling for singletons.====The study proceeds as follows: Section 2 describes the biology of multiple births. Section 3 discusses the National Center for Health Statistics data used in the study. Section 4 explains the birth-set fixed-effects model. Section 5 presents the main results. Section 6 examines robustness checks. Section 7 directly compares singletons to twins using a rich set of maternal controls instead of birth-set fixed effects.

This paper analyzes the effects of initial health, ====.","When health deteriorates or the probability of death increases, individuals’ willingness to pay for medical treatment might increase. This is particularly relevant at the end of life when we observe a surge in health care expenditure (Lubitz and Riley, 2010; Felder et al., 2000). This conjecture is in line with a recommendation by the UK Department of Health (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), 2009) to prioritize treatments at the end of life. The recommendation advises priority in the following circumstances: i) the treatment is indicated for patients with a short life expectancy, normally less than two years; and ii) there is sufficient evidence to indicate that the treatment offers an extension to life, normally of at least an additional three months. The advice applies when such treatments have an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in excess of the upper end of the range normally approved by the Appraisal Committee. The upper end threshold lies at ₤30,000 per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained.====A similar recommendation has also been proposed for persons with low levels of initial health. Nord (1995) suggested that health gains for these individuals should receive more weight compared to gains in persons with a higher initial health level. Nord and Johansen (2014), Richardson et al. (2017) argued for program-specific QALYs, taking into account the severity of an illness. Rather than applying a position of extra-welfarism, such considerations can also be applied on a presumption of generalized diminishing marginal utility of health (see Brouwer et al., 2008). Bleichrodt et al. (2004), (2005) developed the rank-dependent QALY model, a social welfare function under which the equity weight assigned to an individual depends on his rank when individuals are ranked according to their expected lifetime QALYs. This model allows to have higher equity weights for individuals who are initially sicker or face a higher probability of death. Nevertheless, individuals’ initial mortality rate and health status also play a role in decisions based on a standard expected utility model without weighting.====Health is generally considered to be a luxury good. All over the world, the value of health and life has grown faster than GDP (for the US, see Hall and Jones, 2007; Murphy and Topel, 2006). Higher income has boosted demand for health care services at the individual level and provision through national health services or statutory health insurance at the aggregate level.====This paper analyzes the effect of initial health condition, the probability of death and wealth on the treatment decision under uncertainty. It presents a one-period life model with an individual maximizing expected utility, which includes wealth and health in the state of survival and a bequest in the state of death. This general model is complemented with two special cases, the no-bequest model and the QALY model that abstracts from the utility of wealth. Within this framework, the treatment decision is analyzed, employing two classical models of medical decision making under uncertainty, the diagnostic risk model (Bleuler, 1919; Pauker and Kassirer, 1975) and the therapeutic risk model (Eeckhoudt, 2002). These models derive probability thresholds for decision makers when it is uncertain whether the disease is present (diagnostic risk) or whether the treatment is successful (therapeutic risk). The treatment threshold under diagnostic risk defines a probability of disease, above which the preferred course of action is to undertake treatment, otherwise to withhold it. A second threshold refers to the risk that treatment fails and the patient’s utility decreases below the level obtained without treatment. Here a minimum success probability is required such that treatment is the preferred choice. This paper adds the assumption that treatment decreases the probability of death to the two variants of treatment under risk. In fact, although not always satisfied, a mortality reduction is often a property of medical intervention, and, in the NICE recommendation mentioned above, even a requirement. Taken together, treatment has an insurance effect by reducing the diagnostic risk, a risk-increasing effect by involving the therapeutic risk and a protective effect by lowering the probability of death.====We address the question as to how the two treatment thresholds are affected by changes in the probability of death, health and wealth at baseline. Weinstein et al. (1980) showed that an increase in the probability of death increases the value of life, which was taken as a rationale for why societies tend to spend more on rescue missions in which the chances of survival without intervention are low, than on preventive interventions that remove small initial risks. Similarly, due to a decreasing marginal utility of health, a decrease in initial health might increase individuals’ propensity to treat, as the insurance effect of treatment becomes more important. And finally, higher wealth might also lead to more treatments because life is a normal good.====This paper offers five contributions. Firstly, it assumes that treatment not only affects the health level, conditioned on whether patients are sick or healthy (diagnostic risk) or whether the treatment is successful or not (therapeutic risk), but that it can also reduce the probability of death. Secondly, it considers a welfarist bivariate utility function that includes consumption and health, whereas literature on the treatment thresholds so far has only incorporated the utility of health. Thirdly, by incorporating individuals’ wealth, it analyzes how wealth affects the propensity to treat. Fourthly, the comparative statics sheds light on the scope of three different lifetime welfare models to predict treatment decisions when initial health, wealth or the probability of death changes. Fifthly, it differentiates between an individual and an aggregate perspective. Individuals with full insurance coverage of health services will not consider the involved monetary costs when deciding on diagnostic tests and treatments. By comparison, the NHS, for instance, facing a budget constraint will take into account the cost of health services in its decisions on citizens’ access to health care.====We show that an increase in the probability of death has no impact on the insurance effect and the risk-increasing effect of treatment, while it renders the protective effect more important. In turn, the propensity to treat under both the diagnostic risk and the treatment risk increases. This general result holds with and without a bequest motive as well as in the QALY model with one exception. As the treatment cost also reduces the bequest, which in turn lowers the utility of the inheritor, an increase in the probability of death might lower the treatment propensity. A health reduction has an ambiguous effect on treatment under diagnostic risk. While it increases the insurance effect, it reduces the protective effect of treatment, leaving the sign of the total effect undetermined. Under therapeutic risk, a reduction in initial health renders the treatment option more attractive. Higher wealth increases the propensity to treat if marginal utility of wealth is independent of health. If this is not the case, the wealth effect is ambiguous under diagnostic risk and therapeutic risk for individuals with and without a bequest motive. The QALY model implies that wealth does not affect the treatment decision.====Health economic literature on medical decision making under uncertainty is small but growing. Eeckhoudt (2002) analyzed the consequences of risk aversion on the treatment thresholds. As treatment reduces the range of possible health outcomes under the diagnostic risk and increases it under the therapeutic risk, more risk-averse individuals tend to undergo treatment at a lower probability of disease but require a higher treatment success probability to do so. Felder and Mayrhofer (2014), (2017) proved that these opposite effects on the propensity to treat also apply to prudent individuals. Courbage and Rey (2016) studied the treatment decision of mixed risk-averse individuals==== in various situations of increases in risk (severity of potential disease, effectiveness in treatment, side effects and comorbid conditions). While the treatment threshold of mixed-risk aversion individuals generally tends to increase when the environment becomes riskier, the results strongly depend on the specific risk. Felder and Mayrhofer (2018) combined the diagnostic risk and therapeutic risk models and analyzed the implication for the probability of disease threshold and the success rate threshold. A combination of the two risks increases both thresholds. Facing a higher total risk, individuals become more reluctant to undergo treatment. At the same time, the effect of risk-aversion on the propensity for treatment becomes ambiguous when diagnostic risk and therapeutic risk are combined.====Bleichrodt et al. (2003) added comorbidities, captured by the duration of a disease, to the therapeutic risk model. Their analysis, constrained to probabilities of disease above the threshold success rate, focused on the optimal intensity of treatment. The effect of comorbidities on treatment decisions depends primarily on how the individual’s attitude to health status risks varies with duration. In their model, treatment has no impact on the duration of disease, differentiating it from this paper, which assumes that treatment affects the probability of death. Recent research has analyzed the effect of ambiguity aversion on the treatment thresholds. Berger et al. (2013) proved that ambiguity aversion decreases the probability of disease threshold in the diagnostic risk model and increases the threshold success rate in the therapeutic risk model.====The organization of the paper is as follows. Section 2 presents the general model and its two special cases, the no-bequest and the QALY model. Section 3 addresses the treatment decision in the presence of the diagnostic risk. Section 4 adds a test option to treatment under diagnostic risk. Section 5 analyzes the treatment decision under therapeutic risk and Section 6 concludes.","The treatment decision under uncertainty: The effects of health, wealth and the probability of death",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629618311330,16 November 2019,2019,Research Article,266.0

Hence, ==== could affect financial risk-taking by offsetting health-related background risk. We use a ==== to examine whether Medicare eligibility at age 65 increases stockholding in the US and find that it does so for those with college education, but not for their less-educated counterparts who face higher stock market participation costs. Our results are unlikely due to the reduction of medical expenses associated with Medicare coverage because the latter does not affect bondholding.","Public policy interventions often have unintended consequences. Health care policies in particular may have broader implications, for example, for household risk-taking and financial investing, that have not been fully explored.==== This may be the case as health-related background (i.e., not fully insurable) risks are likely to affect financial risk-taking,==== and especially so among older households, given that health care costs strongly depend on age.====In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap by employing a credible identification strategy to estimate the impact of Medicare on stockholding. Specifically, we exploit the fact that the health insurance status of the US population changes drastically at age 65, when most individuals become eligible for Medicare. This institutional feature lends itself to a regression discontinuity design, such that variations in health coverage near the age 65 threshold are arguably “as good as random”. We use data from the US Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a nationally representative survey of older households that provides detailed information on their demographic characteristics and financial decisions. Importantly, the older segment of the population holds the largest share of assets in the United States (78 % of gross equities and 75 % of net worth held by the total population per the 2007–2010 Survey of Consumer Finances).====As shown by Card et al. (2008, henceforth CDM), Medicare eligibility improves health insurance both in terms of coverage (which becomes nearly universal after age 65) and generosity (generally measured as the probability of having two or more health insurance policies). Interestingly, CDM also show that Medicare benefits not only the more disadvantaged but also whites and the better educated, among whom the rise in multiple coverage at age 65 is sharper than among their counterparts from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Consistent with these patterns, Barcellos and Jacobson (2015, henceforth BJ) find that Medicare eligibility reduces out of pocket spending significantly more for the highly educated than for those with less than high school.====Economic theory predicts that a reduction in one type of background risk should induce investment in risky assets, even if the reduced risk is uncorrelated with that of the risky assets (Gollier and Pratt, 1996). Risks related to income, entrepreneurship and health have often been suggested as instances of a background risk that is negatively associated with risky asset ownership.==== A lower background risk, however, may not suffice to induce investment in risky assets. In fact, despite the equity premium, most US households do not hold stocks, and in several standard life-cycle portfolio models incorporating background risk the optimal level of risky assets is zero after the introduction of participation costs (Haliassos and Bertaut, 1995; Vissing-Jørgensen, 2002).====Transaction costs are a leading explanation for the reluctance of households to hold stocks because, as Haliassos (2002) points out, a risk averse utility maximizing household will always want to invest even a small amount in stocks due to the equity premium. This result was first pointed out by Arrow (1974), and holds in the presence of risky labor income, and also of background risk uncorrelated with stock returns. The intuition is that starting from a position of no stock investment, a marginal addition of a risky asset will not contribute to consumption riskiness, while it will allow the household to take advantage of the equity premium. Therefore, if the household does not invest in stocks, then it is likely that such investment entails some cost.====Hence, the existence of participation costs makes the question of whether the willingness to take financial risks is increased due to the drop in background risk stemming from Medicare’s increased insurance coverage generosity ultimately an empirical one.====In addition, given that individuals eligible for Medicare face lower out of pocket medical expenditures, they should have more funds at their disposal, which should, in turn, make them more likely to invest in risky assets.====Our paper is, to the best of our knowledge, the first one to analyze the effect of Medicare on stockholding, and contributes to a small and incipient literature that links health insurance and financial decisions.==== Our primary contribution is to use a highly credible regression discontinuity (RD henceforth) research design that rests on mild identification assumptions to answer a policy relevant question: does the onset of Medicare induce stockholding?====We find that Medicare eligibility induces households with college education to invest in stocks Our preferred estimates suggest an increase in total stockholding (that is, direct, through mutual funds and through IRAs stock ownership), ranging from 7 to about 14 percentage points (pp) for this education group, depending on the method used. On the other hand, we find no effect of Medicare on stockholding for those whose members have not finished college. Our results imply that the reduction in background risk due to Medicare eligibility suffices to overcome the pecuniary and non-pecuniary costs that inhibit participation in the stock market only if these costs are low enough, as is the case for individuals with a higher educational attainment (see Haliassos and Bertaut, 1995). As we discuss below, however, our results likely represent conservative estimates of our effect of interest due to some features of our set-up. Hence, getting health insurance coverage might affect financial risk-taking also for those with less than college education.====An additional factor that might drive our results is the reduction in expected out-of-pocket (henceforth OOP) medical expenditures that Medicare coverage entails. This should lead, however, to increased investment also in less risky financial assets such as bonds. We find no effect of Medicare coverage on bondholding, and thus surmise that our results are primarily driven by the Medicare-induced reduction in background risk.====A paper that is similar in spirit to ours is Goldman and Maestas (2013, henceforth GM), who also explore the relationship between health insurance coverage and financial risk-taking. While GM provide insightful evidence, our work differs from theirs in several important ways.====First, our work is the first to investigate whether Medicare, the second largest social insurance program in the United States, may have unintended consequences on the financial decisions of the elderly. Instead, GM focus on the implications of obtaining additional supplemental insurance==== among Medicare beneficiaries. They find that this supplemental insurance has an economically sizeable and statistically significant effect on risky asset ownership. Interestingly, given that the heterogeneity in terms of coverage and its characteristics is much wider between Medicare beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries than among Medicare beneficiaries, one would expect the onset of Medicare eligibility to have even larger effects on portfolio decisions than those estimated for supplemental insurance (among 65+ Medicare beneficiaries). In any case, the potential consequences of Medicare on financial markets is an important aspect that policy makers may need to be aware of and give consideration when contemplating future health care reforms.====Second, we importantly differ from GM in terms of identification. Estimating the causal effect of health insurance coverage on financial risk-taking behavior is complicated by the fact that insurance coverage is an endogenous variable, and there are concerns over the potential confounding role of unobservables, such as individual health status and risk aversion. GM use an IV approach to address the endogeneity of supplemental insurance choice among Medicare beneficiaries. Specifically, they use as instruments the variation in county-level non-Medicare HMO market penetration and in state laws that limit the structure of risk pooling by insurers. Therefore, their identification strategy crucially relies on the assumption that neither of these instruments correlate with risky asset ownership other than through their effect on supplemental insurance choices. By contrast, we rely on a RD design that exploits the Medicare-induced discontinuity in health coverage at age 65 to identify the causal effect of interest under seemingly mild assumptions compared to those needed for other non-experimental approaches (Hahn et al., 2001).====In work related to ours, Ayyagari and He (2017, henceforth AH) study the effect on portfolio choice of Medicare Part D, which provides a prescription drug benefit and was introduced in 2006. Using HRS data and a difference-in-differences (DiD) identification strategy they find that Medicare Part D increases the propensity to invest in risky assets. Our identification strategy on the other hand does not rely on the parallel trends assumption required in DiD estimation, while our treatment is coverage by the main Medicare program, and not just Part D.====In another related paper related to ours Angrisani et al. (2016), using HRS data and fixed-effects estimation techniques, investigate whether Medicare coverage mitigates the negative effect of bad health on financial risk-taking, and whether this interaction effect is stronger for those who had no health insurance coverage prior to the time they became covered by Medicare. Hence, they do not estimate the direct effect of Medicare coverage on financial risk-taking, but they still find that Medicare coverage makes those in poor health more likely to assume financial risk.====Finally, we examine different subgroups that, in line with economic theory, should exhibit a different propensity to hold stocks in response to Medicare eligibility. Specifically, stock market participation costs which can be both pecuniary (e.g., brokerage fees) and non-pecuniary (e.g., time spent to find the most suitable assets to invest in, to consult with financial advisors, to monitor market developments) typically vary by education. A higher level of human capital is associated with higher financial resources and more efficient information processing, making both these costs easier to bear. Hence, we examine different education groups, as it is natural to expect the impact of a reduction in background risk on stockholding to differ by education due to the education-induced variation in stock market participation costs. In line with this idea, we find that getting Medicare coverage induces stockholding for those with college education, for whom informational and pecuniary stock market participation costs are relatively low, but not for their less-educated counterparts.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives some details on the institutional features of Medicare. We discuss our data and empirical methodology in Section 3 and our main results in Section 4.

To isolate variations in maternal sleep, we exploit unique variations in child sleep disruption using a UK panel dataset that follows mother-child pairs through time. We find that sleeping one hour less per night on average significantly decreases maternal ====, the number of hours worked and household income. We identify one mechanism driving the effects, namely the influence of maternal sleep on selection into full-time versus part-time work. Increased schedule flexibility for mothers with sufficient tenure mitigates the negative effects of sleep deprivation.","Working mothers of small children struggle with keeping a work-life balance, which impacts negatively their wellbeing and the quality of resting time. According to a recent study in the UK, mothers getting six or less hours of sleep a night, are so exhausted while dealing with the conflicting demands of working life and motherhood, that 56 % feel depressed and 82 % admit that the lack of sleep affects their performance and output at work.==== This is because sleep is an essential human need associated with both good physiological and cognitive functioning. Paradoxically, the extent to which sleep deprivation hampers parental economic activity has received very limited attention in economics research so far. The purpose of this paper is to study the effects of child-related sleep deprivation on mothers’ labour market outcomes both in the short-run, as well as on mothers’ labour market careers in the longer-run.====Sleep is often overlooked in economics models despite its obvious restorative effects on human health, alongside its influence on brain plasticity and feelings of well-being (Siegel, 2005; Frank, 2006). Failing to get enough sleep can give rise to chronic diseases associated with hypertension, diabetes, depression and obesity, as well as a reduced quality of life Barnes and Wagner, 2009, Caruso et al., 2006, Scott and Judge, 2006; Giuntella and Mazzonna, 2019).==== Sleep-deprived individuals are more likely to make impulsive decisions, and the prefrontal cortex - which has proven to be critical for executive functioning - is found to be vulnerable to a lack of sleep (Harrison and Horne, 2000). Similarly, a meta-analysis of existing research suggests that sleep deprivation strongly impairs cognitive and motor performance (Pilcher and Huffcutt, 1996; Killgore, 2010). Sleep deprivation, even when moderate, can be detrimental to work performance and this can translate into earnings, consistently with recent evidence (Gibson and Shrader, 2018).====The fundamental challenge in estimating sleep deprivation effects is that sleep patterns are not exogenous to individual economic performance. The existing literature has focused on time use surveys and repeated cross-sections, which makes it hard to isolate the causal effects of sleep deprivation from confounding factors and reverse causality (e.g. working individuals reducing their amount of sleep). In this article, we uniquely rely on a very rich UK longitudinal dataset, ====, that followed a sample of 14,000 families and collected information on both maternal and child sleep patterns nearly every year since child’s birth up to age 12.==== Designed by public health researchers, this dataset provides us very precise information on child sleep, including whether the child wakes up at night, sleep time and day sleep, as well as child sleeping routines and environmental triggers of sleep quality. Following mother-child pairs through time and controlling for unobserved heterogeneity thanks to mother-child fixed effects, this allows us to exploit longitudinal variations in child sleep disruption as an instrument for maternal sleep duration (adjusted for child’s age fixed effects, health, household composition and environmental triggers).====To minimise potential biases due to confounding factors, our empirical strategy proceeds in three steps. First, we consider only differences in sleep patterns within mother-child pairs through time, rather than between them. This is to ensure that time-invariant confounders (such as genetic predispositions towards poor sleep, education, mother’s ability to improve the sleep of her child or persistent mother reporting bias) are not driving our results. Second, the ALSPAC data allow us to isolate maternal sleep deprivation effects from an extensive set of time-varying factors including family-level shocks, parenting style, mother’s and child’s stress, to which extent mother is determined to invest in her career, and father characteristics. Third, we make use of the estimated relationship between observed characteristics and our variables of interest to show that selection on unobservables is unlikely to fully explain our results.==== In attempt to address the issue of reverse causality, the panel nature of the data also allows us to perform simple falsification tests using previous years’ mother sleep patterns and labour market outcomes and investigate the relationship with current child sleep.====Our first results demonstrate that there is a significant relationship between the number of times a child wakes up at night and mother’s sleep duration. We find that a one-unit increase in the number of times a child wakes up at night leads to a reduction in the mother’s average duration of sleep by a bit less than 10 min per night. Increased child sleep disruption reduces the probability of both maternal and paternal sleep duration, although the effect on maternal sleep is more than twice that on paternal sleep.====We then assess the impact of child-related sleep deprivation on mothers’ employment, working-time decisions and income. Using the variations in child sleep interruption over time as an instrument for changes in mother’s sleep duration, we estimate the effect of sleep on mothers’ economic performance to be substantial. Improving the mother’s average nightly sleep duration by half-an-hour==== would increase her participation in the labour market by 2.5 percentage points, her number of hours worked by 8.3 %, household income==== by 3.1 % and her job satisfaction by 0.001 standard deviations.====Sleep interruption can result from children's sleep patterns above and beyond parents’ ability to get their children into a sleeping routine, and hence, entails some degree of uncertainty that makes it hard to predict. As such, child-related sleep deprivation is an important source of variation in parental sleep duration during the childbearing time that is worth exploiting. Also, the negative impact of being a mother on the quality of sleep starts during the pregnancy and can last well-beyond kindergarten. In our data, almost 40 % of children aged 2–5 are still getting their parents up in the night, whilst this is only the case for 20 % of children aged 5-8. Looking at the effect on mothers’ employment and household income five years later, we find that mothers with children who had sleeping problems are still less likely to work and have lower household income than mothers with children who had normal sleeping routines. Five years later, these mothers have household incomes, which are 1.9 % lower compared to mothers who slept 30 min more on average per night.====Investigating potential channels, we find that changes in how mother’s value work relative to other goals in life does not account for these negative effects on mothers’ labour market outcomes. Instead, we show that a reduction in mother sleep duration is associated with (i) a higher probability to experience problems at work, (ii) increased difficulties to deal with the demands of working life and motherhood, and (iii) a shift from full-time to part-time jobs. Also, we find that the negative effects of child-related sleep deprivation are smaller for mothers with less responsibilities (only one child), higher educational qualifications, and better organisation skills. These results suggest that some women have greater ability to adapt to poor child sleep. Increasing access to flexible working hours could attenuate the negative effects of child-related sleep deprivation. To illustrate this, we draw on the UK Employment Rights Act 1996, which entitled the right to request flexible working to parents with 26 weeks’ continuous employment. Using a triple difference strategy, we show that the UK Employment Right Act 1996 mitigated the impact of child-related sleep deprivation for mothers of young children who were eligible to flexible working (either hours, times or location of work).====The general message of this analysis is that sleep is a major determinant of employment outcomes that needs more attention in designing employment policies. The number of hours the average person sleeps has declined over the past century,==== and we still ignore its effects on economic activity and economic performance. The estimated effect of sleep in our study can be attributed to changes in child sleep. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to establish a link between child sleep and mothers’ labour market outcomes. Over the last decades, women have experienced substantial gains on the labour market. That is, the gender gap in labour force participation and earnings have both reduced. Yet, substantial gender gaps remain (Blau and Kahn, 2006). When mothers return to work after childbirth, they are more likely to work below their potential and work fewer hours. This downgrading effect is likely to persist over time, as the birth of a child reduces mothers’ chances of getting promotions and pay rises and their wages plateau (Waldfogel, 1995, 1997). In contrast, men’s wages continue growing rapidly at this point in the life cycle (particularly for the highly educated, Costa Dias et al., 2016). The results we present in this article support the view that child-related sleep deprivation is a factor that limits convergence on the labour market outcomes for working women of young children.====The rest of this paper has the following structure. The next section reviews the related literature. Section 3 presents the data. Section 4 reports OLS regressions of mother sleep duration on child sleep duration and child awakening. Section 5 describes the relationship between mothers’ economic performance and their duration of sleep. Section 6 investigates the robustness checks of the results.

We measure quality in terms of clinical performance and patient-reported satisfaction to capture its multi-dimensional nature. We use a panel covering 8 years for over 8000 English general practices. We measure competition as the number of rival doctors within a small distance and control for a large number of potential confounders. We find that increases in local competition are associated with increases in ==== satisfaction and to a lesser extent in clinical quality. However, the magnitude of the effect is small.","Quality competition is pervasive and important. Quality is a key component of service products such as, transport, telecoms, banking, education and healthcare. Competition on quality is a central component of industrial organisation (product differentiation, bundling, price discrimination). But the relationship between quality and competition is hard to study empirically. Quality is multi-dimensional and often difficult to measure, product prices and quality are typically set together, and market structure and quality are jointly determined. Empirical studies on quality competition are relatively scarce.====One area where an understanding of the empirical relationship between quality and market structure is central is healthcare. Healthcare accounts for over 10 percent of the economy of most developed countries. The quality of care can have large, and long-lasting, effects on the health of the consumer. Injecting greater competition into heavily regulated healthcare markets is a popular reform model in many jurisdictions (Gaynor et al., 2016; Glied and Altman, 2017; OECD, 2008; Siciliani et al., 2017). But this takes place against the backdrop of a long-term trend of provider consolidation in healthcare markets (Gaynor and Town, 2012; Fulton, 2017). Understanding the relationship between quality and market structure in healthcare is therefore important.====Theoretically, the relationship between competition and quality is ambiguous (Gaynor and Town, 2012), even in markets where price is regulated (Brekke et al., 2011, 2014) Empirically, the bulk of the literature on the relationship between competition and quality in the hospital sector points towards a positive relationship where price is regulated (Gaynor and Town, 2012).==== In this paper we examine the relationship between quality of care and market structure in local physician markets. This has been much less researched and the empirical evidence is scarce (Gaynor and Town, 2012). Yet, as in the hospital sector, physician markets are becoming more concentrated and much of this is below the radar of regulatory authorities (Capps et al., 2017). If effort is to be spent promoting competition there is a need to know whether this will increase quality.====We study family physician firms (known as general practices) in the English National Health Service (NHS). General practices provide primary care (healthcare outside the hospital or nursing home setting) and act as gatekeepers to almost all other services provided by the NHS. They are small businesses, typically owned and run by a partnership of 4–5 general practitioners (GPs) who employ nursing and other staff. Almost all practices operate in a single small local market. In common with most European countries, care is free at point of use. Payments to practices are determined nationally and the institutional set-up gives practices an incentive to compete for patients. Patients can only register with one practice and around 75% of practice revenue comes from the number of patients registered with the practice. As patients face zero prices, any positive effect from competition has to come from changes in quality. Fig. 1 shows the market structure for England (as measured by the Herfindhal-Hirschman Index (HHI) of concentration of practice registrations) across the small areas from which GP practices draw their potential patients. The figure shows considerable variation in market concentration. Some markets are unconcentrated, others are highly concentrated. Markets in urban areas are, as expected, much less concentrated than those in rural areas but even within urban and rural areas there is considerable variation. In this setting, patient choice of practice has been shown to be responsive to quality (Santos et al., 2015). Thus, the pre-requisites for competition between providers to improve quality exists: the question is whether it does.====To answer this, we study the universe of all GP practices (over 8000) in England between 2005 and 2012.==== We use six practice-specific measures of quality, some relating to the quality of medical care as judged by national clinical standards and others relating to patient reported satisfaction with their chosen practice. Our empirical strategy is to exploit changes in market structure at the local level, specifically within-practice changes in the number of GPs in other local rival practices. While this design controls for fixed unobservables at the GP and local area level, it is possible that GPs sort into areas in which there are easier to treat patients or respond to increased competition by selecting easier-to-treat patients for whom it is easier to achieve quality indicators. Moreover, areas where population density increases are likely to experience an increase in the number of GPs. Practices in such areas will find it easier to produce higher quality if the increase in density is driven by the entry of more mobile populations who tend to be healthier (Hayes et al., 2017). Such practice level patient changes will lead to overestimates of the effect of competition. To avoid this, we control for a large set of time-varying measures of the health and socio-economic status (SES) of the population of the local area from which the practice may draw its population and for population density. This design allows us to address the potential endogeneity which would arise if areas with better amenities attract more doctors or healthier patients for whom it is easier to achieve higher clinical quality. In robustness tests we consider alternative measures of competition facing general practices, allow for changes in the composition of GPs in the practice and its rivals to isolate the effect of increased effort from changes in GP composition, and also exploit a policy change that increased supply of GPs in some areas but not in others.====Our results show that an increase in the number of GPs in rival practices is associated with increases in both clinical quality and, especially, patient satisfaction. None of our results suggest that greater competition reduces quality. However, in common with results from studies of pay for performance and other policies aimed at improving the quality of care provided by family doctors (Scott et al., 2011), the magnitude of the effect of a change in competition is not large.====Our findings contribute to the literature on quality competition in physician markets and to the debate about whether policies to strengthen competition in these markets should be pursued. In the European setting where there is no price competition amongst providers (providing the ideal setting for examining pure quality competition), there are few studies of the physician market and quality. In the main this literature lacks the exogenous variation needed for causal inference, uses a limited number of outcomes measures, some of which have an ambiguous relation to quality, or analyses small area, rather than firm (physician practice) variation. Schaumans (2015) and Pike (2010) exploit only cross–sectional variation. The former examines the effect of competition in the Belgian family doctor market on pharmaceutical prescriptions. Prescriptions have no direct effect on practice revenue or cost but may make the patient feel that the doctor is taking their health concerns seriously. The unit of analysis in Schaumans (2015) is the small area and she finds little effect. Pike (2010) undertakes analysis at the physician practice level and, as in our study, uses a distance based measure of competition and examines a subset of the quality measures we examine here. He finds that practices with more nearby practices have higher quality. However, as the data is cross-sectional in both these studies, the associations may reflect factors other than spatial competition between doctors.====Brekke et al. (2017) have rich data at the individual physician level and exploit the fact that Norwegian doctors practice in two different settings: their own offices where they see their own patients, and local emergency clinics where they see their own and other GPs’ patients. They argue that this means that GPs face greater competitive pressure when they practice in their own offices and thus will be more responsive in this setting. They examine one outcome: the dispensation of ‘sick notes’ (documents which allow individuals to take time off work with no financial penalty). The setting provides a robust design which allows controls for physician effects, patient effects and physician-patient pair effects. But the outcome variable is not a measure of clinical quality but of responsiveness to patients and may have ambiguous welfare implications if physicians over-prescribe notes to attract patients. More problematic is that the definition of competition: what they examine is not spatial competition but physician behaviour under different contracting arrangements.====The closest research to our paper is Dietrichson et al. (2016). This exploits a reform in Swedish primary care which led to greater entry of providers in municipalities where there was lower availability of providers pre-reform. The authors study both clinical and patient satisfaction measures of quality at the municipality level. They find small improvements in subjective overall quality measures, but no change in avoidable hospitalisations or patient satisfaction with access to primary care. However, although their policy experiment provides a nice context, their unit of analysis is not the firm (the practice) but the municipality. This means that they cannot rule out the possibility that average municipal quality was affected by other municipality level factors, such as an overall increase in the physician-patient ratio, rather than increases in competition facing individual providers.====Research on market structure in physician markets where price and quality are set simultaneously is mainly from the USA and is also limited compared to studies of hospital markets. The research primarily focuses on the impact on prices rather than quality (Baker et al., 2004; Sun and Baker, 2015). It also has to address the fact that prices are increasingly set by complex bargaining between insurers and hospital (see, for example, Clemens and Gottlieb, 2017). The European setting, in which prices are set nationally and patients are generally fully insured, provides a cleaner setting for an examination of the relationship between quality and market concentration in small localised physician markets. It is also particularly relevant to discussions about increasing the role for regulated prices as a way of promoting quality competition in the US healthcare market (Glied and Altman, 2017).====The next section provides a brief account of the institutional framework for English general practices and of policies potentially affecting the amount of effective competition that practices face.

We find that higher temperatures increase ,"The burden of mental illness is immense. Nearly 45,000 people in the United States and 800,000 globally die by suicide each year (National Institute of Mental Health, 2018; World Health Organization, 2018). In 2017, 18.1% of American adults reported struggling with a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder (Mental Health America, 2018). The direct cost of treating mental disorders in the United States is growing at 5% annually and surpassed $200 billion in 2013 (Roehrig, 2016). Direct spending on the treatment of mental disorders now outstrips that for any other single category of illness. It is also widely acknowledged that the indirect costs of mental disorders – realized through lost wages, reduced productivity, disability, and mortality – are likely even larger (Trautmann et al., 2016). Total direct and indirect costs imposed on society have been estimated at nearly $450 billion per year in the U.S. and some $2.5 trillion globally, with these amounts expected to double by 2030 (Pearson, 2014, Trautmann et al., 2016).Yet even these figures likely underestimate the full toll of mental disorders, which also increase the risk of and harm from physical illnesses (Prince et al., 2007).====The relationship between environmental conditions and mental well-being has long been acknowledged and has recently garnered additional attention in the face of climate change (e.g.,: McMichael et al., 2006, Berry et al., 2010). A better understanding of the link between our environment and mental well-being is critical for a nuanced understanding of the societal burden of poor mental health, as well as for understanding and effectively planning for the ways in which variation in weather and climate conditions will impact population mental health in the future.====This investigation contributes to the understanding of the relationship between local, ambient temperatures and a wide range of mental health outcomes. Our primary analyses flexibly characterize the relationship between temperature and multiple distinct measures of mental well-being. We start by utilizing large scale data on two types of actual mental health events: (1) the universe of emergency department visits for diagnoses related to mental health in California over the period 2005–2016 (hereafter: ED visits); and (2) the universe of suicides in the U.S. over the period 1960–2016. We also present supplemental evidence based on relatively low-level mental health outcomes measured via nationally representative survey data on self-assessed mental health status from more than four million respondents over the period 1993–2012. We also asses the extent to which relationships between temperature and mental health might be modified by the following array of technological and policy factors: the passage of time, penetration of air conditioning, availability of mental health service providers, insurance coverage of mental health services, accessibility of substance abuse treatment centers, income levels, and baseline climate conditions.====Our main estimates are important for understanding whether and to what extent ambient temperatures impact mental health outcomes across the spectrum of outcome severity. Practically speaking, such estimates are potentially useful for planning the deployment of mental health and crisis services in response to forecasted temperature conditions in both the short term (responding to local, multi-day forecasts) and long term (responding to predicted shifts in local climatic conditions). Similarly, the empirical identification of factors that modify the relationship could potentially inform approaches for recognizing and addressing variation in mental health outcomes driven by changing temperatures.====Our empirical approach relies on matching measures of mental health to weather conditions at fine spatial and temporal scales (county and month). We then apply panel fixed effects regression models in conjunction with flexible controls for local seasonality. Specifically we leverage location-by-calendar month and location-by-year fixed effects which yield estimates identified from variation in weather conditions within a particular location and cy forecasts) and long term (responding to predicted shifts in local climatic conditions). Similarly, the empirical identification of factors that modify the relationship could potentially inform approaches for recognizing and addressing variation in mental health outcomes driven by changing temperatures.====Our empirical approach relies on matching measures of mental health to weather conditions at fine spatial and temporal scales (county and month). We then apply panel fixed effects regression models in conjunction with flexible controls for local seasonality. Specifically we leverage location-by-calendar month and location-by-year fixed effects which yield estimates identified from variation in weather conditions within a particular location and calendar month, controlling for annual local-level idiosyncrasies. Such variation is considered to be essentially random (Dell et al., 2014, Hsiang, 2016), as we are effectively comparing mental health outcomes in a relatively warm January in San Francisco County with outcomes in a relatively cool January in San Francisco County. Intuitively, our estimates represent the average of all such comparisons across every county, year and month available to us in our data.====We specify the relationship between temperature and the outcomes flexibly, allowing for arbitrary nonlinearities. For all three outcomes, we find that cold temperatures lead to decreases in the incidence of negative mental health outcomes and hot temperatures lead to increases. Although we allow for nonlinearities, we find that the relationship is approximately linear. Our main estimates imply that increasing average monthly temperature by one degree Fahrenheit leads to a 0.48% increase in mental health ED visits and a 0.35% increase in suicides. These baseline estimates are based on very different samples; if we limit the sample for the suicide analysis to the exact same sample used for ED visits (California, 2005–2016) we find a 0.81% increase in suicides. For self-reported mental health, we find that a one-degree increase in mean temperature leads to a 0.06% increase in the number of days with reported poor mental health. Our estimates imply positive, quasi-linear relationships exist between temperature and negative mental health outcomes across outcome severity. These same estimates also suggest higher temperature sensitivities for more severe outcomes.====For ED visits and suicides we provide estimates of the cumulative effects of exposure over longer time frames – up to six months in length. The results suggest that the majority of the impacts of temperature exposure occur contemporaneous to or shortly after exposure. Our estimates therefore represent permanent changes in ED visits and suicides rather than temporal shifting of the outcomes.====We find no evidence of adaptation on any of the margins we analyze: the estimates remain stable over time, air conditioning adoption levels, regions with hotter or colder average climate conditions, and areas with higher or lower incomes. Similarly, we find that none of the policy levers we consider significantly modify the identified temperature-mental health relationships. Taken together, these results suggest a robust link between temperatures and mental health that is not easily avoided, adapted to, or mitigated.====We briefly discuss how our findings parallel and contrast with previous literature which relates temperatures to physical health, emotional states, and behavioral outcomes. This leads to a discussion of the potential mechanisms underlying our results and the presentation of several lines of evidence suggesting that sleep disruptions serve as a primary channel linking higher temperatures with worse mental health outcomes. We also consider the implications of our results in light of climate change as mean temperatures are expected to increase and heat waves become more frequent, intense, and prolonged in much of North America, Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, as well as parts of China (Meehl and Tebaldi, 2004, Russo et al., 2014, Lelieveld et al., 2016, Kang and Eltahir, 2018).====The remainder of the paper is laid out as follows: Section 2 outlines existing research relevant to this investigation, and Section 3 describes the data upon which our empirical analysis relies. In Section 4, we lay out the empirical strategy for the primary estimations and the consideration of modifying factors.

Restrict the ability of insurers to price their contracts according to all relevant individuals’ characteristics, and some adverse selection may emerge.====Our objective in this article is to study this trade-off in the context of the emergence of personalized medicine, defined as the use of an individual's genetic profile to guide prevention, diagnosis, or treatment decisions. The advent of ever cheaper and more informative genetic tests will drive the development of personalized medicine. These tests will allow individuals to obtain very detailed information on their genetic predisposition to several diseases, as well as on potential prevention strategies to decrease the probability of the disease occurring, and on the treatment to be followed if the disease occurs.==== With increasing medical benefits of testing, coupled with lower monetary costs, the prevalence of genetic testing will most probably increase in the foreseeable future.====In such a context, it becomes necessary to better understand how this genetic information should be regulated, and whether current regulations should be modified as the prevalence of genetic testing increases. More precisely, it is likely that in the next decades genetic testing will affect the trade-off between adverse selection and discrimination risk in two ways. First, these tests may convey more precise information on individuals’ health risks. When tested agents are forced by law to reveal to insurers their genetic information, they then face a stronger discrimination risk. Second, in most countries individuals decide whether they want to take a genetic test or not. This decision to acquire information then depends on whether this information has to be shared with insurers or not. If disclosure is mandatory, the ensuing discrimination risk may reduce incentives to take the test in the first place (Hirshleifer, 1971), resulting in the loss of precious health information. If disclosure is not mandatory, individuals may hide any bad information they have discovered, resulting in a stronger version of adverse selection than if they were uninformed of their genetic background. This last effect will likely increase as genetic testing becomes more widely used.====Regulations of the health information generated by genetic testing vary a lot across countries, as described by Otlowski et al. (2012). While regulations labelled “Laissez-Faire” and “Disclosure Duty” mandate disclosure of genetic information to health insurers,==== “Consent Law” and “Strict Prohibition” allow withholding of information.==== The latter type of regulation generates adverse selection while the former type aims at avoiding this adverse selection but creates a discrimination risk. Moreover, the two types of regulation produce different incentives to take a genetic test.====In this article, we compare Consent Law and Disclosure Duty, as these two regulations best exemplify the trade-off between adverse selection and discrimination risk in a setting where individuals are left to decide whether to take a genetic test or not. We first develop a theoretical framework to compare those regulations, and we then devise an experiment to elicit which regulation individuals would selfishly prefer, and whether they would take a genetic test under each regulation. Moreover, we are interested in how preferences for testing and for regulations will evolve as testing costs decrease. An experimental setting is a natural first step to understand behavior and preferences with respect to both regulations, and how they change with testing costs. Observe that, to obtain answers to those questions with empirical data, we would have to find a (quasi-)natural experiment where the regulation has changed at some point in time, and with discontinuities in genetic testing costs across groups. This is very unlikely because these regulations have been introduced quite recently in most countries, and have thus varied very little since their inception.====Our theoretical set-up is as follows.==== Agents can be of two types depending on their genetic background: type ==== have a low probability of developing a disease while type ==== have a high probability. Agents are uninformed about their type, unless they take a genetic test which reveals their type without error, and allows them to better tailor a prevention effort (====, tests have medical value).==== Genetic tests are costly to individuals, because of their monetary cost but also because some agents may dislike knowing with precision their genetic background. Agents are then heterogeneous in their testing cost. After deciding to test or not, individuals buy health insurance on a perfectly competitive market.====Under Disclosure Duty (DD hereafter), equilibrium contracts are such that individuals pay an “average” premium if they do not test, but are faced with a discrimination risk if they test, in the form of a lottery (low premium if type ====, high premium if type ====). As for Consent Law (CL hereafter), in light of the current low take-up rate of genetic tests (see Hoy et al., 2014), we assume that insurers offer a pooling contract with full (exogenous) coverage to all who pretend (truthfully or not) to be uninformed. At equilibrium, agents show their test results to the insurers if they are revealed to be type ====, and pretend to be uninformed (====, not to have done the test) otherwise. The equilibrium (zero profit) premium attached to the pooling contract reflects the intensity of adverse selection at play (with a higher premium when more type ==== individuals falsely pretend to be uninformed).====Solving the analytical model allows us to obtain three hypotheses that we then test with an experiment. First, test take-up rates decrease with the test cost under both regulations, and are higher under CL than under DD (since obtaining bad genetic news can be hidden from the insurer under CL). Second, the test take-up rate under CL increases with the amount of adverse selection (since agents test in order to escape the pooling contract, which is made less attractive by the higher equilibrium premium necessitated by a higher level of adverse selection). Third, agents prefer CL when the test cost is low, and DD when the test cost is large.====We design an experiment in a neutral framework in which subjects have to make several choices between a lottery and a sure payoff. The lottery (resp., the sure payoff) corresponds to the pay-off obtained when (resp., when not) testing. We have opted for a neutrally-framed (rather than for a health-framed) experiment because it is the most direct way to translate our model into an experiment, but also because this allows us to control directly for the heterogeneity in test costs (which, in our theoretical model, stands for both the financial and psychological costs of the genetic tests). More precisely, the payoffs offered to subjects correspond to the equilibrium contracts obtained in the analytical part of the paper, when considering four different costs of the genetic test, and five different intensities of adverse selection (for the CL regulation).====Our experimental results match the main theoretical predictions, but also allow us to go further and to shed light for instance on the intensity of the trade-off between adverse selection and discrimination risk. We refer the impatient reader to the concluding section for a more detailed summary of the main results of the paper. We find evidence of both discrimination risk and of adverse selection at equilibrium. Subjects seem very sensitive to the discrimination risk, since most of them do not test under DD, even when the test cost is low. Under Consent Law, take-up rates increase with the adverse selection intensity. A decrease in the test cost, and in adverse selection intensity, both make it more likely that Consent Law is preferred to Disclosure Duty.====We now turn to the related literature, starting with the articles closest to ours. Barigozzi and Henriet (2011) and Peter et al. (2017) compare DD and CL (among other regulations). Their result (that DD dominates CL) depends crucially on two simplifying assumptions that we are not making here: that genetic tests are costless, and that individuals are homogenous in their preference for information acquisition. These assumptions imply that ==== individuals test under CL at equilibrium. By contrast, we obtain in our setting that not all individuals test under either CL or DD, because they vary in their (financial, but especially psychological) cost of taking the test. Hoel et al. (2006) study the consequences for the testing decisions of introducing heterogeneity in psychological preferences (repulsion from chance), in a setting with separating equilibria, but do not compare the properties of various regulations.====Gemmo et al. (2017) develop a model where agents have access to a free technology (such as telemonitoring) that reveals their type to the insurers. This technology then plays a role similar to genetic testing in our consent law environment. Their model differs from ours in several important ways. First, they consider separating contracts. Second, all individuals are aware of their risk type, and the technology is only used to reveal this type to insurers (while in our setting agents who have not performed genetic tests are unaware of their type). Third, agents differ in their utility cost of revealing their risk type to the insurers (transparency aversion), so that low risk agents who are sufficiently transparency averse will not reveal their type to the insurers, in stark contrast with our setting.====Few articles assume that insurers offer a pooling contract, an assumption much more in line with current practice than the separating contracts à la RS used by the rest of the literature. Hoy (2006) studies the equity-efficiency trade-off of regulatory adverse selection based on a pooling equilibrium. Bardey and De Donder (2019) analyzes which type of equilibrium (pooling or separating) emerges as a function of the genetic test take-up rate under Consent Law. A recent survey of the economic effects of risk classification bans, including in settings where insurers provide pooling equilibria, is provided by Dionne and Rothschild (2014). Other papers assuming pooling contracts under CL are Hoy et al. (2003) and Crainich (2017), but they do not compare regulations.====Strohmenger and Wambach (2000) focus on health issues where the willingness to pay for treatment is lower than the treatment's cost. This simple twist to the assumptions underlying standard insurance models is enough to generate strikingly different results. To start with, only agents with a low probability of getting sick wish to buy an actuarially fair insurance contract. Strohmenger and Wambach (2000) study the impact of genetic tests in two settings: with symmetric information (corresponding to the “laissez-faire” regulation allowing insurers to request genetic tests and use their results) and with asymmetric information (a “strict prohibition” regulation preventing insurers from making use of test results). They show that, in the case of symmetric information, genetic testing can enhance efficiency, in contrast to standard models. They obtain the opposite result in the strict prohibition setting, where the introduction of genetic testing can result in a complete market failure where no one buys insurance anymore. Note that these results are obtained for a large set of equilibrium contracts (pooling with full or partial coverage, separating with or without cross-subsidies across types).====All related articles mentioned so far are applied theory papers. Schudy and Utikal (2018) is the only paper we are aware of studying an experiment dealing with the acquisition and disclosure of personal health data in health care markets, but this paper does not study the trade-off between adverse selection and discrimination risk. Miller and Tucker (2018) studies how US States genetic privacy laws affect the diffusion of personalized medicine, using data on genetic testing for cancer risks. They focus on three aspects of the US regulations: the requirement of informed consent from tested individual, restrictions to discriminatory usages of genetic data by employers, health care providers or insurance companies, and limits to redisclosure of genetic information without the consent of the individual. Their obtain that “approaches to genetic and health privacy that give users control over redisclosure encourage the spread of genetic testing” (p. 1), which is in line with our result that agents test more under CL than under DD.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 develops the theoretical model, including the set-up and the analysis of the two regulations. Section 3 presents our experimental setting. Section 4 presents our experimental results.

This effect is economically and statistically significant for a large dataset covering hundreds of prescription drugs sold in the US during the period 1994Q1–2003Q4. This paper proposes the first systematic analysis of what appears to be a market anomaly.====We propose a model to characterize the market equilibrium before and after generic entry. We identify precise conditions under which entry reduces the quantity market share of the molecule. Intriguingly, this is more likely to occur when the remaining patent-protected molecules feature low horizontal differentiation. We test this and other theoretical predictions of the model and find they are validated empirically.","The growing costs of health care and pharmaceutical treatments often make newspaper headlines. High hopes are generally put on the market penetration of generics to limit ballooning drug prices. The results have been mixed: as we detail in this paper, generics indeed appear to be very effective competitors against molecules that experience Loss of Exclusivity (LoE). However, they typically fail to dent the position of drugs that remain on patent. As we show below (see Fig. 1, p. 6) at least until 2003, generic entry was associated with a ==== in the ==== market share of the genericized (and thus cheaper) molecule. Still today, the availability of generics fails to dampen overall expenditure growth in the US, a country where drug prices are primarily determined by competitive interaction (see ==== Crow, Jan. 4th, 2018). In that context, the recent record number of generics approval by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) praised by ==== is welcome, but unlikely to put a lid on prices.==== This suggests that the ==== effects of generic competition are poorly understood.====A central characteristic of the pharmaceutical industry is the unique combination of high investments in research and development and in promotion.==== While R&D is the driver of market entry and of the differentiation between treatments, it is sunk by the time of generic entry, in contrast to promotional effort. Once on the market, a firm that wants to gain market share must either reduce its price or intensify its promotion effort. The process of approaching doctors to tout the virtues of a treatment is known as ====. For large players, detailing and other forms of promotion represent 15–20% of total sales, about the same as R&D. Also, detailing was a still relatively unregulated activity in the 1990s and early 2000s,==== which offers a unique opportunity to study the broader question of how promotion affects competition in the pharmaceutical industry.====The model abstracts from the R&D decision and focuses on the period around the loss of exclusivity (LoE) that triggers generic entry. We distinguish three phases: (1) before generic entry, two firms, ==== and ====, have a monopoly on their own molecule. Doctors seeking a treatment for their patient are thus facing a differentiated duopoly. (2) One of the two molecules, say ====, loses exclusivity. We model this as a switch toward perfect competition for market segment ====, while firm ==== retains exclusivity. We call this an ====. (3) The third phase is when also ==== loses exclusivity, leading to perfect competition for both molecules. We derive the market equilibrium in each of these three phases and identify three main results that are important to understand the effects of generic entry—the changes between phase 1 and phase 2 in the model.====First, generic competition for ==== allows ==== to increase its price ==== its market share when the two products are ====. This reverses the effects of a competition shock in the absence of promotion. The rationale is that the more substitutable the two goods are, the more aggressively ==== and ==== compete prior to generic entry, in phase 1. This translates into initially lower prices and higher promotion. In that situation, generic entry has a comparatively small impact on prices: the reduction in promotion dominates. ==== levels of differentiation have the opposite effect: prices are initially high and promotion low. Then, generic entry primarily affects prices: both ===='s and ===='s prices drop.====Second, ==== benefits from ===='s loss of exclusivity when the market is large and profitable. The reason is that these are the markets in which firms initially invest the most in promotion and detailing. Then again, profit erosion on the ====-segment after generic entry triggers a large drop in promotion intensity for ====, which eases competitive pressure on ====. Hence, the prediction of the model is that generic competition significantly curtails ===='s market share only in small and comparatively less profitable markets.====Third, we can compare the market outcome in each of the first and second phase with the market outcomes that would result from perfectly competitive market conditions (third phase). Compared to that benchmark, we find that the market allocation is always worsened by asymmetric competition: the market share of ==== only increases when it is already too high in the first place, and it only decreases (to the benefit of ====) when it is already too low (we briefly discuss welfare in the concluding section).====Bringing these results to the data, we find that they are more than a theoretical construct: using a data trove tracking prices, promotion, and quantities sold in the USA during the period 1994–2003, we show that competition by generics in the multi-billion-dollar pharmaceutical market often fails to put effective pressure on the drugs that remain protected by a patent. As detailed in Section 2, despite price drops as high as 45% for the drug experiencing generic entry, the average effect is to boost the market share of ====. The ==== market share of the molecule that is now cheaper—the originator drug ====—drops by 31% in the pharmacy channel and by 26% for drugs sold in hospitals.====Instances of generic entry are also an ideal testing ground for technical reasons. First, generic entry typically results from an exogenous cause: the loss of patent protection. It has a set date, some 20 years after the patent was introduced.==== It also produces a competition shock that is quite different from the entry of new competing products. Such a clear dichotomy between the launch of new products and the loss of market power for a single product would be difficult to observe in other markets. Second, agency issues between patients, physicians, and insurances likely increase the sensitivity of demand to promotion relative to prices, which magnifies the effects we are after.====Our sample covers all prescription sales in the U.S. between 1994Q1 and 2003Q4 (40 quarters). From that dataset, we extract all the therapeutic classes (“ATC3 markets”) for which data on prices, quantities, and promotional efforts are available. We then cross these data with that of the FDA to identify episodes of generic entry (see Section 4). This leaves us with 95 episodes of generic entry scattered over 53 different ATC3 markets.====After controlling for other sources of heterogeneity, we find that, on average, generic entry alone causes a 15% ==== in market share for molecules that remain on patent. The effect is smaller in the hospital channel: in part because of effective procurement processes, hospitals display higher price elasticity. In line with theoretical predictions, this reinforces the effect of price competition—by about 4 percentage points. We also propose a novel measure of product differentiation for the pharmaceutical industry based on the number of modes of action within a therapeutic class. Again in line with predictions, differentiation knocks another 4 percentage points off the market share gain of the competitors. Last, the market share gain is further reduced by 8 percentage points in “small” markets. All these results are more pronounced when the molecule experiencing the LoE was a blockbuster. Finally, we explore the connection between our findings and evergreening (the presence of a second-generation product by the same originator). In particular, in Section 6.1 we show that the gains in market share of on-patent drugs is more pronounced when the originator company that experiences LoE also owns patent rights on another drug in the same therapeutic market. In other words, evergreening turns out to be a strategic complement to the promotion effects identified by our model.==== Our paper is at the intersection of several literature strands, including industrial organization, advertising, and health economics. With regard to our empirical application, the existing literature on competitive interactions in the pharmaceutical industry has produced a complex, and sometimes contradictory, picture. One group of papers analyzes inter-brand competition when drugs are still patent-protected (see, for instance, Brekke and Kuhn, 2006 for a theoretical model and Dave and Saffer, 2012 for empirics). de Frutos et al. (2013) analyze inter-brand competition when the proportion of brand-loyal consumers is endogenously determined by promotional effort.====Another strand focuses on intra-molecular competition following loss of exclusivity—====, when a generic bio-equivalent drug can legally come to market (==== Scott Morton, 2000).==== It was in that context that the “generic entry paradox” has been unearthed (the paradox being that the price of the originator drug often goes up following the launch of a competing chemically equivalent generic). This empirical finding has been thoroughly documented (see ==== Caves et al., 1991, Regan, 2008, Vandoros and Kanavos, 2013).====The few papers that attempted to simultaneously analyze pre- and post-LoE competition have produced a mixed picture. For instance, Stern (1996) provides evidence of intense inter-molecular competition, whereas Elison et al. (1997) reports strong intra-molecular rivalry between the originator and the generic version of the drug, as well as weak (or insignificant) inter-molecular competition.====A related literature focuses on the relative importance of the persuasive and informative roles of promotional effort (Ching and Ishihara, 2012) and on whether detailing and direct-to-consumer advertising have a market expansion effect (Ching et al., 2016, Iizuaka, 2004, Iizuaka and Zhe Jin, 2005, Fischer and Albers, 2010). Mizik and Jacobson (2004) analyze the effectiveness of promotional effort by estimating the long-run effect of detailing and sampling on prescriptions for three drugs. Manchanda et al. (2004) assess whether, from a business perspective, detailing is misallocated across individual physicians. Narayanan and Manchanda (2009) show that the persuasive effect dominates at the end of a molecule's exclusivity period.====Huckfeldt and Knittel (2011) show that evergreening strategies (the launch of a second-generation product by the same originator) helps explain instances of volume market share drop of the previous generation molecule, despite being sold at a fraction of the original price. Lakdawalla and Philipson (2012) share our motivation (volume sales drop following LoE) and exploit a similar sample. The main difference lies in the fact that we explicitly model competition, and derive testable implications that help explain the heterogeneity in market reactions they identify.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents some facts central to our research question. Section 3 presents the model and derives testable implications. Section 4 describes the data, while Section 5 presents the empirical results. Section 6 reports robustness and sensitivity checks. Section 7 concludes by discussing how the presence of non-price instruments can lead to mismatch between consumers and goods when competition is asymmetric.",The unexpected consequences of generic entry,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629618305332,1 October 2019,2019,Research Article,279.0

What remains surprisingly unexplored is that role that health ,"The neoclassical economic model of crime laid out in Becker’s seminal contribution to the applied microeconomics literature envisions crime as a gamble undertaken by a rational individual who is weighing the costs and benefits of offending at the margin.==== The cost and, therefore, the supply of offending is understood to be a function of the certainty and severity of criminal sanctions. On the demand side of the market, a victim’s “demand” for crime is a function of the marginal costs and benefits of investments in precaution – a category that includes capital investments (e.g., locks or surveillance cameras) as well as changes in routine activities that raise offender search costs (Ehrlich, 1996).====A large literature examines the sensitivity of crime to policy inputs that potentially shift costs and benefits and can be readily manipulated by a social planner.==== While policy regimes sometimes shift in response to legislation or new technology, they are typically constant, evolving slowly over time or shifting only occasionally. In most cases, an offender (victim) who goes to sleep in the evening faces the same policy regime and thus the same costs and benefits of offending (precaution) when he wakes up the next morning. In this sense, the costs of offending that are shifted by a social planner – or a technological shock – are essentially permanent or long-run costs. In this paper, we point out that participants in the market for offenses face transitory shocks as well and that these are in constant flux. Given that market participants may be myopic or, at least, only boundedly rational, shifts in situational factors may be particularly relevant in the market for offenses, especially for violent offenses that often do not require planning and which need not have instrumental motives. Yet, despite the fact that violent crimes drive an outsize share of the social costs, the literature is mostly silent on the extent to which shocks to situational factors shocks explain variation in violent crime.====One of the most salient ways in which situational factors vary is due to transitory fluctuations in an individual’s health. It is therefore surprising that while a large literature documents the effects of exposure to crime on heath, there has been little exploration of the role that health shocks play in explaining aggregate movements in the crime rate.==== In this paper, we consider the responsiveness of crime to transitory fluctuations in the costs and benefits, and therefore the ==== of criminal activity that is generated by a pervasive and common health shock: seasonal allergies caused by exposure to environmental pollen.====Pollen allergies affect up to 20 percent of the U.S. population, are a leading cause of absenteeism at work and are associated with symptoms that can be extremely debilitating, especially for young adults who are the age group that is at greatest risk to offend (Jauregui et al., 2009; Greiner and Pattanayak, 2012). Leveraging daily variation in local pollen counts in sixteen U.S. cities, we present novel evidence that violent crime declines by approximately 4 percent on days in which the local pollen count is unusually high. While this might sound like a small behavioral response, it is on par with the change in crime that would be expected to accrue from a 10 percent increase in the size of a city’s police force (Evans and Owens, 2007; Chalfin and McCrary, 2018). Interestingly, we do not find evidence of temporal displacement, indicating that market participants are not smoothing out their behavior over time.====We explore the mechanisms underlying this relationship using detailed microdata from New York City. Stratifying the results by the location of the incident, we show that high pollen counts lead to an especially large decrease in violent crimes which occur inside residential dwellings, crimes which typically involve violence between intimate partners or family members.==== We examine outdoor activity on high pollen days, as proxied by the public’s usage of Citibike, a bicycle rental service, and find suggestive evidence that fewer people are outdoors when pollen counts are high. This implies that the risk of residential violence, which is predominantly domestic assault or family violence, is even more sensitive to transitory health shocks than the previous analysis suggests.==== Accordingly, this research suggests that while property crimes sometimes require planning and hence respond to permanent changes in incentives, violent crimes which typically require less planning may respond more to transitory shocks generated by situational factors. To our knowledge, this is the first research to document such a link between health shocks and aggregate crime levels.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the symptomology and incidence of seasonal pollen allergies in the United States and presents a model that provides theoretical guidance to describe different mechanisms through which pollen may affect crime. Section 3 presents the data used in the study, and discusses our choice of cities and measures of pollen. In Section 4 we discuss our estimation strategy. Section 5 presents results, Section 6 explores robustness and mechanisms and Section 7 concludes.","More sneezing, less crime?

Unlike most other safety net programs, SNAP varies little across states and over time, which creates challenges for quasi-experimental evaluation. Notably, SNAP benefits are fixed across 48 states; but local food prices vary, leading to geographic variation in the ","The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly the Food Stamp program) is the nation’s most important food assistance program and one of the largest safety net programs in the United States. SNAP plays a crucial role in reducing poverty for children in the U.S., with only the EITC (combined with the Child Tax Credit) raising more children above poverty (Fox, 2017; National Academy of Sciences, 2019). Eligibility for the program is universal in that it depends only on a family’s income and assets, and due to the relatively small phase-out rate, the program impacts both working and nonworking families (Bauer et al., 2018). In fiscal year 2018, SNAP provided $61 billion in food benefits to 40 million individuals in 20 million households.====SNAP’s primary goals are to improve food security among low-income households, reduce hunger, and increase access to a healthful diet.==== While many prior studies have estimated the impact of SNAP on food security, in this study, we examine the impacts of SNAP on child health, advancing a new identification strategy. Estimating the causal relationship between SNAP and child and family wellbeing is difficult because SNAP benefits and eligibility rules are legislated at the federal level and do not vary across states, leaving few opportunities for quasi-experimental analysis. Furthermore, because SNAP serves people when they need the program, it is difficult to disentangle the (presumably positive) impact of SNAP from the (presumably negative) impact of the circumstances that made a family become eligible for SNAP or decide to enroll in the program (see Bitler, 2015 for recent evidence on this issue).====The existing evidence on the causal effects of SNAP on child health and food insecurity takes several approaches.==== One set of studies uses variation in state SNAP application and administrative procedures (e.g., allowing online applications, whether there is a finger printing requirement, asset requirements, recertification intervals) to instrument for SNAP participation and finds reductions in food insecurity (Yen et al., 2008; Mykerezi and Mills, 2010; Shaefer and Gutierrez, 2013; Ratcliffe et al., 2011) and reductions in child BMI (Schmeiser, 2012).==== A second set of quasi-experimental studies analyzes the rollout of the food stamp program across counties in the 1960s and 1970s and finds that the program leads to improvements in birth outcomes (Currie and Moretti, 2008; Almond et al., 2011). A third approach uses variation in immigrant eligibility for SNAP generated by welfare reform legislation in the 1990s. For U.S.-born children of immigrants, the evidence indicates that SNAP improves infant health, and access to SNAP prior to age 5 positively affects health at ages 6–16 (East, 2019). Finally, the USDA Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer for Children (SEBTC) demonstration documents that higher SNAP benefits in the summer months (to offset the loss of school meal programs) leads to a reduction in food insecurity (Collins et al., 2016).==== Taken together, this literature provides consistent evidence of beneficial effects of SNAP on food insecurity but more limited evidence on SNAP’s causal impacts on child health, particularly beyond BMI (see also reviews by Bitler, 2015; Bitler and Seifoddini, 2019; Hoynes and Schanzenbach, 2016; Gregory et al., 2015; Gundersen and Ziliak, 2015).====Our study contributes to this literature by examining the effects of SNAP on a broad set of child health outcomes and by advancing a new research design. We consider the impacts of SNAP on health care utilization, preventive health care visits, days missed from school, obesity, mental health, and self-reported health status. We leverage plausibly exogenous geographic variation in the ==== to identify the effects of variation in SNAP generosity on health. Importantly, the SNAP benefit formula is fixed across 48 states (benefits are higher in Alaska and Hawaii) even though the price of food varies greatly across the country (Todd et al., 2010, 2011).==== Across the continental U.S., maximum benefits vary only with family size; in 2018 a family of three was eligible for a maximum benefit of $504/month regardless of the local cost of living. Though SNAP benefits are implicitly adjusted for variation in the cost of living through allowed deductions (e.g., for housing and child care) in the calculation of net income, the limited available evidence indicates these adjustments are not sufficient to equalize ==== benefits, particularly in high cost areas (Breen et al., 2011). Gundersen et al. (2011) and the Institute of Medicine (2013) propose this as an area for future research.====Higher SNAP purchasing power may impact children’s health through three possible channels. A ==== (nutrition) effect occurs if higher SNAP purchasing power leads to increases in the quality or quantity of food. By freeing up resources more generally, higher SNAP purchasing power may also impact health ====, facilitating households to increase consumption of other inputs into the health production function, like health care. Finally, if additional SNAP purchasing power leads to reductions in stress and “bandwidth poverty” (Bertrand et al., 2004; Mullainathan and Shafir, 2013), it may result in better compliance with activities such as getting children to school and to the doctor for annual exams.====Linking nationally representative data from the 1999 to 2010 National Health Interview Surveys (NHIS) to information on regional food prices from the Quarterly Food-at-Home Price Database (QFAHPD), we study the effect of variation in SNAP purchasing power on children’s health care utilization and health. Our measure of SNAP purchasing power compares the maximum SNAP benefit to the regional cost of the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP), a nutrition plan constructed by the USDA to represent a nutritious diet at minimal cost and the basis for maximum legislated SNAP benefits (i.e., maximum benefits are set to the national average TFP cost). The QFAHPD includes information on food prices that allows us to construct an estimated TFP price for each of 30 designated “market group” geographic areas across the U.S. We relate child health care utilization and health outcomes to SNAP purchasing power (i.e., the ratio of the national SNAP maximum benefit to the market group-level TFP price faced by a household) in a fixed effects framework that controls for a number of individual-level and region characteristics (including non-food prices in the area) and state policy variables. Identification comes from differences across the 30 market groups in trends in the price of the TFP.====Our study contributes to the growing body of evidence on the SNAP program and its effects in a few key ways. First, we provide new evidence on the relationship between SNAP benefit generosity and the health and wellbeing of children. Our findings consistently indicate that children in market groups with lower purchasing power of SNAP utilize less preventive/ambulatory health care. We find that a 10 percent increase in SNAP purchasing power raises the likelihood a child has an annual checkup by 6.3 percentage points (8.1 percent) and the likelihood of ==== doctor’s visit by 3.1 percentage points (3.4 percent). While lower SNAP purchasing power does not result in contemporaneous declines in parent reported health status, we document evidence of detrimental impacts on some health indicators, like the number of school days missed due to illness, as well as on children’s food security. Summary indices corroborate the existence of effects on health care utilization, but not health outcomes generally. We confirm that these estimated effects are not driven by relationships between geographic variation in food prices and SNAP participation or health insurance coverage, nor are they present in placebo samples of children of college educated mothers and non-citizen children, both of which have low rates of SNAP participation.====A second contribution is methodological, in that our approach highlights a new identification strategy for estimating effects of proposed changes in SNAP generosity on other outcomes of interest. To our knowledge, ours is the first study to utilize variation in the real value of SNAP as a source of identification.==== Future research could leverage geographic variation in SNAP purchasing power to examine SNAP’s impacts on nutrition, food consumption and other spending patterns, birth outcomes, and adult health.====We interpret our estimates as reflecting the impacts of variation in SNAP purchasing power, rather than simply the effects of variation in local food prices.==== Variation in real SNAP generosity may affect households differently than variation in prices to the extent that local earnings adjust to account for higher local prices (Roback, 1982; Albouy, 2008; Moretti, 2013), while SNAP benefits do not. Indeed, we demonstrate that SNAP purchasing power does not have statistically significant impacts on our key health outcomes or food insecurity within samples that are mostly ineligible for SNAP or have very low SNAP utilization (e.g., non-citizen children, children in families with a college educated mother). Perhaps most importantly, we find no statistically significant effects of SNAP purchasing power on measures of household income or poverty, and our child health results are robust to including controls for regional prices of other goods (such as housing, energy, transportation, etc.), suggesting that we are not simply capturing the broader effects of living in differing labor or housing markets.====More broadly, our findings point to sizable, beneficial impacts of SNAP (and of increasing the generosity of SNAP benefits) for children’s health care utilization, food security, and some measures of their health, benefits which should be weighed carefully against the cost savings of any proposed cuts to the SNAP program. These results also shed light on the expected impact of adjusting benefit levels to account for geographic variation in food prices across market groups. Such adjustments would likely reduce disparities in preventive/ambulatory care, school absenteeism, and food insecurity among low-income children, but may not lead to contemporaneous changes in other health outcomes. Our research design does not allow us to make conclusions about beneficial effects of SNAP that may accrue over the longer run.====The paper proceeds as follows. The next section describes our multiple sources of data on regional food prices, child health, food security, and SNAP participation, and Section 3 lays out our empirical approach. Section 4 presents our main results regarding the impact of SNAP purchasing power on children’s health care utilization and health, Section 5 explores mechanisms and several robustness checks, and Section 6 concludes.","Local food prices, SNAP purchasing power, and child health",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629619304151,13 September 2019,2019,Research Article,281.0

We assess the effect of two decades of improvement in cancer treatment options on the labor market outcomes of breast and ==== and a quality-adjusted ==== index. We find that innovations in cancer treatment during the 1990s and 2000s reduced the negative employment effects of cancer by 63% to 70%, corresponding to a reduction in the economic costs of prostate and breast cancer diagnoses by 13,500 and 5800 dollars per year, respectively. The benefits of medical innovation are limited to cancer patients with postsecondary education.","Apart from being one of the major causes of mortality and morbidity, cancer also has important economic consequences because cancer patients often reduce their labor supply. Medical innovations in cancer treatment are primarily designed to lower mortality, but they may also have the benefit of helping cancer patients maintain their pre-cancer labor market activities. Hence, when assessing the costs and benefits of new medical treatments, it is important to take into consideration not just whether the new treatment can extend the lives of cancer patients but also whether it can help patients participate in the labor market and maintain their productivity. However, potential economic benefits may vary across patients with different characteristics, in particular socio-economic status.====In this paper, we address two important questions related to medical innovation in cancer treatment. First, we provide the first evidence on how medical innovation in cancer treatment affects the labor market outcomes of breast and prostate cancer patients. Second, we assess differences in labor market benefits of medical innovation by patients’ level of education to determine whether economic gains related to medical innovation differ by socio-economic status. To estimate the effect of medical innovation, we use unique Canadian administrative data from several sources. Our findings imply substantial gains from medical innovation in terms of smaller declines in employment and earnings following a cancer diagnosis. These gains are observed almost exclusively among individuals with postsecondary education.====Cancer research has grown rapidly in recent decades (Sudhakar, 2009), leading to a 23% decline in cancer-related death rates in the U.S. between 1991 and 2016 (Siegel et al., 2016). Lichtenberg, 2013, Lichtenberg, 2014, Lichtenberg, 2015, Lichtenberg, 2017, Lichtenberg, 2018a, Lichtenberg, 2018b provides U.S., Canadian, and international evidence directly tying a decline in cancer mortality to an increase in available drugs and cancer research more broadly. This decline in mortality comes at a cost. The median cost of developing a new cancer drug is 800 million U.S. dollars (Prasad and Mailankody, 2017). Between 2005 and 2012, total public expenditures on chemotherapy and radiation therapy in Canada increased by factors of 3 and 3.5, respectively, in real terms (de Oliveira et al., 2018).====Existing evidence on the indirect benefits of cancer treatment innovation typically focuses on a single drug or combination of drugs and attempts to estimate patient utilities (Delea et al., 2013, Gharaibeh et al., 2017, Meng et al., 2018, Zhou et al., 2018). Studies that account for productivity loss due to cancer are limited to a decline in employment due to patients’ death (Hanly et al., 2015, Pearce et al., 2018). In contrast, this is the first paper that explicitly estimates the effect of medical innovation on the labor market outcomes of surviving cancer patients, which is an important determinant of the total benefits of new treatment options.====We focus on prostate and breast cancer for three reasons. First, they are the most common cancer diagnoses among men and women. Second, survival rates are high compared to other cancer types, so breast and prostate cancer patients are more likely to benefit from improved treatment options in terms of their labor market outcomes. Third, although cancer usually occurs later in life, a substantial fraction of prostate and breast cancer diagnoses occur during working age. Hence, we expect meaningful changes in labor market outcomes in response to improved treatment. Bradley et al., 2002a, Bradley et al., 2002b, 2005, 2006, Bradley et al., 2007a, Bradley et al., 2007b, 2013) analyze the labor market outcomes of breast and prostate cancer patients, but to our knowledge no study has considered the role of treatment innovation in this context or in the context of any other cancer types. We provide more background on breast and prostate cancer in Section 3.1.====To study the labor market effects of innovation in cancer treatment, we use data linking the Canadian 1991 Census cohort with the Canadian Cancer Registry and individual income tax returns. These data provide a representative sample of individuals diagnosed with breast and prostate cancer in Canada between 1992 and 2010 (see Section 4). We track the labor market outcomes (employment status and annual earnings) of these cancer patients before and after their diagnosis and identify a control group consisting of individuals who were never diagnosed with cancer. We capture the cumulative level of medical innovation related to the treatment of breast and prostate cancer by counting the number of drugs that were approved for the treatment of these cancers and by constructing a quality-weighted patent index (see Section 3.2). To our knowledge, no other study has used patent data to estimate the effect of medical innovation on labor market outcomes.====Using data from the treatment group (cancer patients) before and after the diagnosis and from the control group, we employ difference-in-differences regressions to estimate the impact of cancer diagnosis on labor market outcomes and the degree to which this effect is moderated by medical innovation. To study how the impact of innovation varies by education, we estimate separate regressions for patients with different levels of highest educational attainment: primary, secondary, and postsecondary education. In all regressions, we use Coarsened Exact Matching weights to balance treatment and control group based on observed variables, including pre-treatment labor market outcomes. Section 5 presents a detailed description of our empirical strategy.====Our results confirm the existing evidence of negative labor market effects of breast and prostate cancer diagnoses. More important, we find that medical innovation, measured by the number of approved drugs and patents, reduces the negative employment effect of prostate cancer by about 64–70% over our study period. For breast cancer, medical innovation mitigated the negative effect on employment by 63–68%, and this effect was concentrated among women aged 35–44 whose breast cancer diagnoses are typically more severe than the diagnoses of older women. We also find effects of medical innovation on earnings that are only statistically significant in the case of prostate cancer. Our results imply that medical innovation between 1992 and 2010 could be associated with a reduction in the economic cost of a cancer diagnosis by about 13,500 and 5800 dollars per patient and year in the case of prostate and breast cancer, respectively. When estimating separate effects by education, we find that the economic gains of medical innovation arise almost exclusively among patients with postsecondary education. These results are robust to various alternative specifications. We present a comprehensive discussion of our empirical findings in Section 6.====This study contributes to several distinct literatures. First, and most important, we contribute to the small but growing literature on the labor market effects of medical innovation, which focuses on pharmaceutical innovation such as the birth control pill (Goldin and Katz, 2002, Bailey, 2006), painkillers (Garthwaite, 2012; Bütikofer et al., 2018), HIV treatment (Papageorge, 2016, Thirumurthy et al., 2008), antidepressants (Bütikofer et al., 2019) and hormone replacement therapy (Daysal and Orsini, 2014), as well as minimally invasive surgery (Epstein et al., 2013). These studies use the introduction of a specific medical technology as a natural experiment. In contrast, we do not focus on one particular innovation but take a broader view on medical innovation and consider the labor market effects of cumulative medical innovation in cancer treatment over two decades.====We also shed light on the value of medical innovation more generally. Cutler et al. (2001) show that increased medical spending is cost-effective in many cases. Murphy and Topel (2003) develop a general framework to evaluate the gains from medical innovations and find that the economic benefits of reducing mortality are very large. We contribute to this literature by considering the individual benefits that arise from medical innovation when cancer patients are able to stay economically more active after a diagnosis.====Finally, we contribute to the literature on the nexus among health, education, and economic outcomes. For example, Lundborg et al. (2015) and Parro and Pohl (2019) show that the labor market effects of health shocks differ by education in Sweden and Chile. Heinesen and Kolodziejczyk (2013) find larger negative employment effects among less educated breast and colorectal cancer patients in Denmark. Glied and Lleras-Muney (2008) find that declines in mortality due to health-related technological progress are largest among highly educated individuals and Lleras-Muney and Lichtenberg (2005) show that patients with more education are more likely to use recently launched drugs. We add to this literature by studying how the interaction between medical innovation and education affects cancer patients’ labor market outcomes.","Medical innovation, education, and labor market outcomes of cancer patients",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629619302516,11 September 2019,2019,Research Article,282.0

Our results reveal that patients are on average willing to travel 0.1–2.7 additional kilometers for a one ==== increase in quality. Patients respond to both objective and subjective quality measures, suggesting that patient satisfaction scores may constitute important complements to clinical indicators when choosing provider.","The role played by quality as a factor explaining patients’ choices of healthcare provider is a key component of the quality-competition theory, according to which providers have incentives to compete on quality when prices are fixed (Gaynor, 2006, Brekke et al., 2014). However, hospital competition on quality is possible only if demand for healthcare is not inelastic with respect to quality. As such, flexible patient choice of provider has been introduced in many healthcare systems across the world as a way to make healthcare demand more responsive to quality (Propper, 2018). Over the last decade, a number of studies have evaluated the association between quality and choice for elective care, finding that patient choice is to some extent responsive to quality (see, e.g., Pope, 2009, Varkevisser et al., 2012, Moscone et al., 2012, Santos et al., 2016, Gaynor et al., 2016, Moscelli et al., 2016).==== However, most studies to date have only considered clinical quality indicators.====In this paper we empirically investigate to what extent healthcare consumers vary in their choices of provider depending on the nature of the reported quality information. Specifically, we relate the choices of maternity clinics of expectant mothers to “objective” (clinical indicators) and “subjective” (patient satisfaction scores) performance measures using rich German data from administrative hospital discharge records linked to publicly available information about provider quality.==== We focus on maternal care in Germany for several reasons: first, healthcare consumers in Germany are entirely free to choose hospital due to the universal health insurance system (which covers treatment in all hospitals) and the absence of a formal gate-keeping system (which regulates access into specialized care).==== Furthermore, the market for hospital childbirths is highly competitive with many producers and consumers of the service.==== Finally, consumers in this market are likely to exert effort to make substantiated choices because they value any information that allows them to scrutinize their options over the course of their pregnancy.==== Thus, the context of German maternal care suggests a close to optimal market setting where high-stakes patients are able to make informed choices between competing providers.====Our empirical analysis entails the use of three merged datasets from Germany. First, we use a 10% nationally representative sample of all German hospital births for years 2009–2012 from a rich patient-level dataset of hospital discharge records, including a wide range of patient characteristics, services, clinical outcomes, and geographical locations of both hospitals and patients. We link this information to a set of objective quality indicators taken from standardized public report cards that all hospitals are required to provide. These report cards disclose relevant information for prospective patients, such as availability of medical services, clinical patient outcomes, capacity and competency of the medical staff. Finally, we complement the objective quality indicators with subjective quality information in the form of patient satisfaction scores from a nationwide survey administrated by one of Germany's largest public health insurance providers. The survey includes information on patients’ satisfaction with their medical treatment, staffing, communication, organization, and accommodation in the hospital. Linking the hospital discharge records to the quality indicators in this manner allows us to directly use information that prospective patients have access to when choosing provider in contrast to relying on indirect information derived from, for example, hospital episodes.====We first estimate a simple linear probability model for the dichotomous choice between the closest hospital and any other hospital in a pre-defined choice set as a function of the former hospital's distance and quality. We subsequently model patient choice structurally using a conditional logit model from which we are able to compute marginal utilities to provide a direct estimate of a patient's willingness to travel (WTT) to a provider with higher reported quality. To this end, we use information on the distance between an individual's home and the chosen hospital to construct a measure of a representative patient's WTT for a given improvement in reported quality.====Our results indicate that patients generally respond to hospital quality, but also that responses vary substantially across quality indicators. Patients appear to respond to subjective quality also after conditioning on objective quality, suggesting that patient satisfaction scores provide a complementary source of information about the performance of a hospital that goes beyond established clinical indicators. We estimate that, depending on the specific quality indicator, an expectant mother is on average willing to travel an additional 0.1–2.7 km (0.2–4.5 min by car) to give birth in a hospital with a one standard deviation higher reported quality. This corresponds to a WTT of up to one-third of the average distance to the closest hospital for individuals in our sample. Our findings are largely robust to a set of sensitivity checks with respect to model specification, choice set and variable definitions. Despite somewhat attenuated coefficients, most of our results still hold when we incorporate hospital fixed effects in our model to account for time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity in hospital quality.====The literature on the competition-quality-choice nexus, upon which many of today's healthcare systems are built, is relatively scarce but growing==== and only a few papers have explicitly considered the trade-off between distance and quality.==== We contribute to this important area of research mainly in two ways: First, we compare how patients respond to two qualitatively different dimensions of quality in their choice of healthcare provider for maternal delivery services. To our knowledge, while some studies have found that distance to the hospital has a significant effect on patients’ choice (Porell and Adams, 1995, Sivey, 2012), only three studies (Moscone et al., 2012, Pilny and Mennicken, 2014, Gutacker et al., 2016) analyzed the influence of social interactions and subjective quality on patient's choice of hospital. In this work, however, the contrast of the effects of objective and subjective quality is in many ways different from the one analyzed by Gutacker et al. (2016). The subjective quality that we use captures patients’ satisfaction across various hospital organizational domains, whereas in Gutacker et al. (2016) it is a measure of change in the patient's health status captured by routinely collected Patient Reported Outcomes Measures (PROM) like the Oxford Hip Score (OHS). In other words, the subjective quality indicators in our paper are proxies of ==== hospital quality. Using non-clinical subjective quality indicators has several advantages. It differs from previous literature, shedding light on the role that the perception of organizational and management quality has in the choice of elective hospital care; a question related and possibly preliminary to the one investigated by Bloom et al. (2015). It also represents a general measure of the broad quality of hospitals, thus being a sensible quality measure with respect to the choice of hospital service we analyze, whereas a subjective clinical measure like the OHS would be unsuitable to use, even if available, given that pregnancy is not a disease like osteoarthritis. Moreover, and differently from the OHS and other PROMs, a non-clinical subjective quality measure is less prone to the confounding bias due to differences in the post-treatment health status.====Second, we contribute to the literature on the determinants of women's choice of birth clinic which has previously only rarely been investigated. O’Cathain et al. (2002) report evidence for Wales that a large minority of women giving birth did not feel like they exercised an informed choice in their maternity care. They show that evidence based leaflets were not effective in promoting informed choice in women using maternity services from a sample of 13 maternity units in Wales. Moreover, Wagle et al. (2004) show that distance to hospital and higher socioeconomic status are the main drivers of choice of place of maternal delivery (i.e., home versus hospital) in Nepal, but the study does not include any quality measure. Differences in healthcare experience or environment at critical times have also been found to affect psychological status of the mothers during pregnancy (Jomeen and Martin, 2008). Our results suggest that expectant women are highly responsive to reported quality when choosing clinic to give birth in, but also that the particular performance indicator appears to be crucial for the magnitude of the response.====The paper is organized as follows. The next section provides a summary of the relevant characteristics of the German healthcare system. Section 3 describes the data we use for our empirical analysis.

We find the answer to be yes for TV advertising but no for magazine advertising. Our results indicate that a policy banning TV advertising of e-cigs would have reduced the number of smokers who quit in the recent past by approximately 3%. If the FDA were not considering regulations and mandates, e-cig ads might have reached the number of nicotine replacement therapy TV ads during that period. That would have increased the number of smokers who quit by around 10%.","Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS), of which electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) constitute the most common sub-product, are a non-combustible alternative to smoking. As opposed to smoking cigarettes, the use of ENDS, termed vaping, delivers nicotine to the user without exposing that person to tar—the substance in cigarette smoke responsible for most of its harm. In all ENDS products (referred to as e-cigs from now on), a liquid containing nicotine is vaporized by a battery powered heating device.====Participation in the use of e-cigs has increased dramatically since they were first introduced in the U.S. in 2007. According to the upper portion of Fig. 1, participation among adults grew from 0.3% in 2010 to 6.9% in 2014. Participation by 18–34 year olds was 1.5 times higher than that of adults of all ages by 2014. The figure depicts similar trends for youth. Participation by youths in grades 6 through 12 increased from 1.0% in 2011 to 11.3% in 2015.====Concurrent with the surge in e-cig use, there has been a substantial increase in advertising from $3.6 million in 2010 to $112 million in 2014, with the vast majority of spending devoted to magazines (59%) and television (27%) with national reach (Kim et al., 2014; U.S. Surgeon General, 2016). Fig. 2 depicts these trends in more detail. There was virtually no advertising before 2012, followed by a sharp increase through 2014. Advertising decreased in 2015 but increased again in 2016.==== In 2014 Q3, spending per ad increased. E-cig advertisers moved from showing ads on infrequently watched programs to showing e-cig ads on frequently watched programs.==== Almost 48% of adults had been exposed to e-cig marketing in a 2013 sample of Florida residents (Kim et al., 2014). Youth and young adult exposure was at least equal to 10% at the national level in the same year (Duke et al., 2014).====E-cig use and advertising have surged during an extremely contentious policy debate. At the heart of this regulatory debate are fundamental questions regarding whether e-cigs will draw cigarette smokers away from a dangerous habit or lure new initiates to tobacco use and lead to a new generation of nicotine addicts. On one side of the debate is the argument that e-cigs constitute a tobacco harm reduction strategy. E-cigs are less dangerous than cigarettes because the vapor does not contain the toxins contained in the smoke of conventional cigarettes (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2016b; U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2016). While e-cigs are not a completely safe alternative to cigarettes, in April 2016 the Royal College of Physicians in Great Britain issued a report urging smokers to switch to e-cigs (Royal College of Physicians, 2016).====The recent trends in U.S. smoking rates provide hints that the growth of e-cig participation might be helping to reduce smoking. The lower portion of Fig. 1 highlights the well-known downward trend in adult smoking. The rate fell from 20.9% in 2005 to 15.1% in 2015. During the 2011–2015 period in which data on e-cig participation are also available, adult smoking participation fell by almost four percentage points. The figure further shows that the growth in e-cig participation among youth was also accompanied by a downward trend in youth smoking.====On the other side of the policy debate are several arguments that suggest caution about e-cigs. There is no research on the long-term health effects of e-cig use. Adolescent nicotine exposure via e-cigs may have lasting adverse consequences for cognitive development (U.S. Surgeon General, 2014). Accidental poisoning can result from the damaging of e-cig products as reflected by the large increase in the number of calls to poison centers involving e-liquids (Richtel, 2014). The greatest danger may be that these products may induce adolescents to begin nicotine addiction first by using e-cigs and then transitioning into smoking (U.S. Surgeon General, 2016).====The general debate over e-cigs has carried over to the regulation of e-cig advertising. In the U.S. until 2016, e-cigs were regulated as an ordinary consumer product and allowed to advertise as long as they did not make health or cessation claims. In 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) extended its authority over tobacco products to include e-cigs. The FDA announced regulations that would ban the sale of e-cigs and related products to minors effective immediately and would require advertisements to carry warnings that the product contains nicotine, which is addictive, effective in August 2018. In addition and also effective in August 2018, all products that were not commercially marketed prior to February 15, 2007 would have to submit marketing applications (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2016a). Because the marketing application approval process can be quite lengthy and the cost of preparing it has been estimated at between $200,000 and $2 million by the FDA, it has the potential to eliminate many current producers and result in significant price increases. In July 2017, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb indicated marketing applications will not be required until August 2022 and that he would consider endorsing e-cigs as a method to quit smoking (Kaplan, 2017).====The status quo remains that e-cig manufacturers are allowed to advertise in magazines, television, and other media in the U.S, although the advertisements had to carry warning labels starting in August 2018. In 2016, however, the European Court of Justice, Europe’s highest court, found that the European Union had the right to regulate e-cigs including banning advertising (Jolly, 2016). Moreover, in March 2018 seven health and medical groups sued the FDA over the four-year delay in the marketing applications requirement (McGinley, 2018).====The purpose of this paper is to shed light on one side of the contentious debate just outlined by investigating whether e-cig advertising on television and in magazines encourages adult smokers to quit. To preview our results, the answer to this question is yes for TV advertising but no for magazine advertising. We use detailed information on TV viewing patterns and magazine issues read in the Simmons National Consumer Survey and match this information to all e-cig ads aired on national and local broadcast and cable stations and all ads published in magazines from Kantar Media.

To examine the effects of the beverage tax of 1.5 cents per ounce in Philadelphia, we surveyed adults and children in Philadelphia and nearby comparison communities both before the tax and nearly one year after implementation. We find that the tax reduced purchases in Philadelphia stores and that Philadelphia residents increased purchases of taxed beverages outside of the city. The tax reduced the frequency of adults’ soda consumption by 31 percent, but had no detectable impacts on adults’ consumption of other beverages. The tax had no detectable impact on children’s consumption of soda or all taxed beverages, although children who were frequent consumers prior to the tax reduced their consumption after the tax.","Countries worldwide have experienced a rapid increase in the prevalence of diet-related chronic diseases. For example, between 1975 and 2014, the worldwide age-standardized prevalence of obesity more than tripled, from 3.2 to 10.8 percent, among men and more than doubled, from 6.4 to 14.9 percent, among women (NCD Risk Factor Collaboration, 2016a). Over roughly the same period, the age-standardized prevalence of diabetes also rose considerably worldwide, more than doubling, from 4.3 to 9.0 percent, among men and rising from 5.0 to 7.9 percent among women (NCD Risk Factor Collaboration, 2016b). Over the past 25 years in the United States, the prevalence of adult obesity rose from 22.9 percent to 39.6 percent, and the prevalence of childhood obesity rose from 10.0 percent to 18.5 percent (Fryar et al., 2016a, 2016b; Hales et al., 2017). Moreover, rates of obesity vary across the population. Among both adults and children, the prevalence of obesity is highest among African-American and Hispanic individuals (Hales et al., 2017).====In response, governments have debated policies to improve diets. There is particular concern about the role of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), which now represent the primary source of added sugars in the U.S. diet (Malik and Hu, 2011). Because they are fluids with simple carbohydrates and therefore are metabolized quickly, SSBs do not cause feelings of satiation and thus contribute to higher overall calorie intake (Malik and Hu, 2011). SSBs also contribute to a high glycemic load, which leads to insulin resistance and diabetes (Malik and Hu, 2011).====One common policy recommendation for reducing sugar intake and obesity is a tax on SSBs. For example, in 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended taxes on SSBs as a key measure for addressing childhood obesity (WHO, 2016). Numerous countries have implemented taxes on SSBs, including Belgium, Chile, Fiji, Finland, France, Mexico, Norway, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Tonga, and the United Kingdom (Cawley et al., 2019). Also, since 2015, a number of U.S. cities have implemented taxes on SSBs, including Berkeley, California; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Boulder, Colorado; San Francisco, California; Oakland, California; Albany, California; and Seattle, Washington. Yet, there is limited rigorous evidence about the effects of such taxes, especially on purchases and consumption.====In this paper, we estimate the impact of the beverage tax in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on purchases and consumption. The Philadelphia beverage tax was implemented on January 1, 2017. The amount of the tax is 1.5 cents per ounce, and, uniquely among beverage taxes in U.S. cities, it is levied not just on sweetened caloric beverages (such as regular soda) but also on sweetened non-caloric beverages (such as diet soda). Unsweetened beverages (such as bottled water), 100 percent fruit juices, and beverages that are at least 50 percent milk (such as chocolate milk) are untaxed. Although the scope of the tax differs from other cities in the U.S. by including sweetened non-caloric beverages, the amount of the tax is comparable to that in other cities, which range from one to two cents per ounce. The amount of the tax in Philadelphia represents approximately 20 percent of the pre-tax price of a 20-ounce bottle of Coca-Cola or Pepsi and approximately 50 percent of the pre-tax price of a 2-liter bottle of Coca-Cola or Pepsi in that city. Interestingly, the amount of Philadelphia’s tax is within the range of the optimal soda tax, as estimated by Allcott et al. (2018).====Other research has found that Philadelphia’s tax was fully passed through to consumers, raising prices by 1.6 cents per ounce on average across all taxed beverages, which is a 21 percent increase (Cawley et al., 2018a).==== For regular soda specifically, prices increased by 1.6 cents per ounce, which is a 30 percent increase. The pass-through rate of the tax is higher in Philadelphia than in other U.S. cities, including Berkeley and Boulder (Cawley and Frisvold, 2017, Cawley et al., 2018a, Cawley et al., 2018c) also find that the pass-through rate in Philadelphia varies based on the location of the store and the characteristics of the surrounding neighborhood, which motivates our analysis of the heterogeneous effects of the tax on purchases and consumption. Specifically, the pass-through rate was higher in stores closest to the center of the city that were farther from competitors selling untaxed beverages, and was higher among stores in higher poverty neighborhoods. Furthermore, after the tax was implemented, stores in Philadelphia increased the availability of untaxed beverages, particularly bottled water, and decreased the availability of taxed beverages (Cawley et al., 2018a). These changes in product availability occurred across all store types. The shift by stores to stock healthier beverages could also influence households’ consumption by changing the relative availability of healthy and unhealthy beverages.====There exists one previous study of the impact of the Philadelphia beverage tax on consumption.==== Zhong et al. (2018) conducted a phone survey before the tax (December 2016) and shortly after the tax (January and February 2017) in Philadelphia and three nearby comparison cities (Trenton, New Jersey; Camden, New Jersey; and Wilmington, Delaware). Based on the repeated cross-sections, the authors estimate that, in Philadelphia after the tax, the probability of daily consumption of regular soda fell 40 percent, the probability of daily energy drink consumption fell 64 percent, and the probability of daily consumption of bottled water rose 58 percent. There were no changes in most of the additional outcomes of the study, including daily consumption of SSBs or diet beverages; the total volume consumed in the past 30 days of SSBs (or any type of SSBs), diet beverages, or bottled water; or the 30-day consumption frequency for any type of beverage, except regular soda.====The only other evidence on the impact of SSB taxes on consumption in the United States comes from the tax of one cent per ounce in Berkeley. Falbe et al. (2016) estimate that, among adults in low-income neighborhoods in Berkeley (relative to Oakland and San Francisco), the frequency of SSB consumption fell by 25 percent six months after the tax, and the frequency of bottled water consumption rose by 44 percent. Three years after the tax, the reduction in SSB consumption was larger, over 50 percent on average (Lee et al., 2019). Other studies have attempted to estimate the effect on consumption of national SSB taxes in other countries, but they lacked a geographic control group and thus could not isolate the impact of the taxes from changes that would have occurred in absence of the taxes.==== The Berkeley study by Falbe et al. (2016) and the Philadelphia study by Zhong et al. (2018) are based entirely on repeated cross-sections (as opposed to longitudinal data) and examined only adults, not children.====To understand the effect of the Philadelphia beverage tax on consumption, we first examined changes in ====. We interviewed consumers exiting a representative sample of retail stores in Philadelphia and a comparable set of stores outside of Philadelphia (in the surrounding counties within Pennsylvania’s Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)), to determine the volume of taxed and untaxed beverages purchased. Using repeated cross-sections, we compare the change in purchases among consumers at stores in Philadelphia before and after the tax with the change in purchases among consumers at stores in the comparison communities over the same time period. We find that purchases decreased at stores in Philadelphia and increased at stores outside of Philadelphia, resulting in a relative decrease of 8.5 ounces of taxed beverages purchased per shopping trip in Philadelphia. The tax does not appear to have affected the likelihood that Philadelphia residents shopped outside of the city. Instead, Philadelphia residents who already shopped outside of the city shopped there more frequently and purchased more SSBs outside of Philadelphia after the tax.====We next examined the effect of the tax on ==== of taxed and untaxed beverages and added sugars from SSBs. Based on interviews with consumers exiting stores in Philadelphia and the comparison communities, we enrolled one adult and one child from each household in a longitudinal survey of consumption, with a baseline survey 1 to 2 months before the tax and a follow-up survey 10 to 11 months after the tax was implemented. For children, we find that the tax did not impact beverage consumption, on average. However, for children who were high consumers of SSBs, the tax substantially reduced consumption. The tax decreased the intake of added sugars by 14.7 g per day or 22 percent for children who consumed 67 g of added sugars daily, or approximately one 20-ounce bottle of regular soda each day, prior to the tax.====For adults, the tax decreased the frequency of regular soda consumption by approximately 10 times per month and reduced the probability that an adult in Philadelphia consumed regular soda daily by 11 percentage points or approximately 31 percent. We do not find evidence of substantial changes in consumption of other beverage types among adults. However, we find some evidence of a slight reduction in consumption of sugars from SSBs among adults of approximately 6 fewer grams per day.====We further investigate heterogeneous effects of the tax on consumption among demographic groups with particularly high rates of obesity (e.g., African-American and Hispanic adults and children) and groups for which we might expect to have stronger responses to the tax (e.g., those that are less likely to shop for beverages outside of the city and those trying to consume fewer SSBs). We also examine the effect of the tax on households living in poverty and those receiving public assistance, as there is evidence that the elasticity of demand for SSBs varies by income and demographics (Lin et al., 2011). In general, we do not find consistent effects of the tax for subgroups, with a few exceptions. Namely, we find that the tax decreased consumption for African-American adults and children and adults who view SSBs as bad for their health.====This paper makes several important contributions to the literature. First, it provides the first estimates of the impact of SSB taxes on children’s consumption. Past studies of city-level beverage taxes have estimated effects on consumption only for adults.==== Since children and adults may consume SSBs from restaurants, school, or other sources that are not included in household retail purchases, estimating the impact on consumption complements the analysis of purchases to provide a more complete understanding of the influence of the tax. Second, this study is the first to use longitudinal survey data to estimate the impact of a city-level tax on consumption of SSBs; previous studies of Philadelphia and Berkeley both used repeated cross-sections. An advantage of using longitudinal data is that we can eliminate the influence of time-invariant heterogeneity. Another advantage is that it allows us to examine whether the impact of the tax varies based on level of pre-tax consumption. Third, we estimated the impact on consumption 10 to 11 months after the tax; earlier studies used data from 1 to 2 months after the Philadelphia tax and from 1 to 5 months after the Berkeley tax.==== Examining data 10 to 11 months after a tax may provide a better sense of the longer-term, post-adjustment effects. Finally, we directly observe changes in beverage purchases and the location of the purchases and examine reported shopping behaviors to understand any impact of the tax on cross-border shopping. The only other study to examine cross-border shopping, Roberto et al. (2019), did so by estimating changes in sales at stores outside of the city, which only provides an indirect estimate of cross-border shopping.====In the next section, we describe the original surveys conducted and primary data collected for this study. In Section III, we present the analysis of purchases (including an examination of cross-border shopping), beginning with a description of the methods and concluding with the results. In Section IV, we present the analysis of consumption, again beginning with a summary of the methods followed by the results. We conclude with a discussion of the findings and implications of the results for future beverage tax policies and related research.",The impact of the Philadelphia beverage tax on purchases and consumption by adults and children,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629618309494,13 August 2019,2019,Research Article,285.0

But that was not always the case. We ask when and why the female advantage emerged. We show that reductions in maternal mortality and fertility are only partial reasons. Rather, the sharp reduction in infectious disease in the early twentieth century played a role. Those who survive most infectious diseases carry a health burden that affects organs and impacts general well-being. We use newly collected data from Massachusetts containing information on cause of death since 1887 to show that females between the ages of 5 and 25 were disproportionately affected by infectious diseases. Both males and females lived longer as the burden of infectious disease fell, but women were more greatly impacted. Our explanation does not tell us precisely why women live longer than men, but it does help understand the timing of their relative increase.","Women live longer than men in most parts of the world today.==== In many places, they live a lot longer. Among OECD nations in recent years, the difference in life expectancy at birth is around four to six years (seven in Japan). But have women always lived so much longer than men? The answer provided in recent studies is that they have not.====Many hypotheses have been put forward to explain the so called “female advantage” in life expectancy. Most of the reasons why women live longer than men can be found by understanding the difference between having two X chromosomes, rather than having an X and a Y, and the resulting impact on hormones.==== Whereas genetic factors are at play, the fact that the advantage increased greatly in the latter half of the twentieth century suggests that environmental factors, particularly those that interact with specific genetic elements, have disproportionately benefited women. In this paper, we examine ==== the female advantage emerged, to understand ==== caused the advantage to widen.====A complete answer concerning why there was a large increase in the female advantage still eludes us. But we argue that the reduction in infectious diseases played a role in extending longevity primarily through its impact on survivors and not because of the reduction in deaths directly from disease. To document this we collected data from Massachusetts containing information on causes of death from 1887 to around 1930 to show that people dying from infectious disease between the ages of 5 and 25 were disproportionately female. As infectious disease was reduced for all, females therefore reaped more benefits than did males. Though our explanation does not tell us why women were disproportionately affected by infectious disease, it helps us understand the timing of the onset of the female advantage.====We should be clear at the outset regarding the impact of infectious disease and its decline on the female life expectancy advantage. The direct effect will be small. It is the indirect effect among the survivors that we, and others, believe greatly explains the increase in longevity in general and the greatly widening advantage of females. As mortality from infectious disease fell, the fraction who were the survivors and who thus carried with them the markers of past illness, also decreased. A healthier population resulted, and females were disproportionately impacted.====Male mortality rates have always been higher for infants (Drevenstedt et al., 2008). But any advantage that females had at birth, or even those they had conditional on surviving to year one, were slight until some time in the twentieth century.==== The female advantage in longevity greatly increased starting early in the twentieth century, reaching a maximum of eight years in the US by the 1970s. The difference then narrowed, but has remained substantial (Cullen et al., 2016).====The reasons that women began to live much longer than men have been studied by many. But existing explanations are incomplete. The reduction in maternal mortality as well as the decrease in the total fertility rate, for example, have been shown to explain at most one-seventh of the growing female advantage in longevity.==== Our estimate is within that range. Increased smoking by men in the early twentieth century, which greatly expanded around WWII, is part of the reason that women began to live longer than men. But smoking was later taken up by women as well and that is one explanation for the narrowing of death rate differences by sex that has occurred since the 1970s.==== Because smokers are affected with a 20- to 30-year delay, the full effect of the diffusion of tobacco use will not be apparent for some time. But even with this caveat, smoking alone cannot fully account for the rise and fall in longevity gender gaps (Cullen et al., 2016; Preston and Wang, 2006).====Our contribution is to explore the reasons behind the initial appearance and early widening of the female longevity advantage that started well before maternal mortality declined and prior to the mortality impact of the smoking upsurge. In the US, as well as in England (including Wales), France, and Sweden, a noticeable female advantage among those aged five to twenty years old emerged at the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries. We connect our findings on this understudied phenomenon to the expansion of the female advantage that appeared later in the twentieth century.====Before the turn of the twentieth century, young women had a small but clear ==== in mortality from infectious diseases. That disadvantage disappeared when infectious disease prevalence fell, largely due to public health interventions. We examine various explanations for why girls had greater infectious disease mortality rates, but find no evidence that differential mortality was caused by differential nutrition by sex or by parental neglect. We argue that, because infectious disease in early childhood can be linked to chronic diseases in adulthood, the decline in infectious disease in the early part of the twentieth century generated a female advantage in childhood that later emerged as a female mortality advantage among adults in the second part of the twentieth century.====Most of the evidence we present is for the US and comes from our analysis of the vital statistics records for Massachusetts, the first US state to collect these data. These data are mainly in period, not cohort, form, but our work informs a cohort analysis. We conclude that the decrease in infectious disease as a cause of death for a cohort meant a decrease in the later-life burden of infectious disease on other causes of death for that cohort.====Our paper has four parts and proceeds as follows. In part I we review the long-run history of life expectancy for males and females in the US and Europe. Part II examines sex differences in mortality among the young and presents our findings about female excess mortality during periods of high infectious disease. Part III confronts why girls died at higher rates than did boys in the era of infectious disease. Part IV concludes with evidence on the relationship between the early disease environment and later-life mortality.",XX > XY?: The changing female advantage in life expectancy,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629618310026,10 August 2019,2019,Research Article,286.0

We use data from a ==== (CCT) experiment in rural Tanzania designed to incentivize safer sexual behavior by conditioning transfers on testing negative for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). For women, we find that negative ==== and the relatively infrequent timing of the CCTs. When women experience a negative shock, cash needs are immediate, while transfers linked to a CCT are paid out in a specific point in time. If women are unable to access credit during a shock, they may resort to transactional sex even if they face monetary incentives to do otherwise.","Poor people in low-income countries are confronted with and have to respond to many different risks. Risk-coping behaviors by the poor can have long-term adverse consequences for both human and health capital, which has implications for the persistence of poverty. Transactional sex, which is the exchange of money or gifts for sexual relations, is believed to be one means that women use to cope with negative shocks (income shortfalls or unexpected expenses), and considered an important factor in shaping the HIV/AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa (Li et al., 2007; LoPiccalo et al., 2012).====A better understanding of the market for transactional sex requires us to examine how income fluctuations affect the sexual behaviors of both women (supply-side) and men (demand-side). While considerable progress has been made in identifying the effects of both positive and negative income shocks on women, there has been less work documenting how men are affected by shocks.==== Why is this important? As credit, insurance, and savings access expands (via micro and mobile methods) to the poor, it brings about improved methods of consumption smoothing. This access will have implications for the transactional sex market depending on the income and price elasticities of both the supply and demand side. Previous studies that have examined aggregate economic-wide shocks (Dupas and Robinson, 2012; Burke et al., 2014; Wilson, 2012), find evidence consistent with supply side responses dominating the demand side. Our study sheds additional light on the sexual responses to individual level shocks by both genders.====This study uses a sample from the RESPECT study (de Walque et al., 2012), a randomized control trial (RCT) conducted in rural Tanzania that involved four rounds of data collection spaced 4 months apart.==== At each round, individuals are asked about their sexual behavior and tested for four curable sexually transmitted infections (STIs).==== These STIs serve as objective biomarker evidence of unprotected sex and are important reproductive health outcomes. The RESPECT study paid study participants conditional cash transfers (CCTs) contingent on testing negative for STIs at each round – participants were randomly assigned into this treatment arm. Finally, at each round, individuals are asked if their household had experienced food insecurity over the past 4 months; those who did are coded as experiencing a negative shock. We view these shocks as individual or household level ones and not as an aggregate type shock (i.e. droughts) that affects an entire community.==== To deal with concerns that the shock is endogenous, we use individual and round fixed effects in all of our specifications. We also do a series of robustness checks that address time-varying factors and alternative explanations.====We find that women respond to shocks by increasing their risky sexual behavior, while we do not detect any significant changes for men. Specifically, women experiencing a negative shock are 5 percentage points more likely to be infected with an STI and are more likely to have unprotected sex with a non-primary partner (i.e. someone who is not her spouse or long-term partner). The magnitude of the increase in STI risk is large, amounting to a 36% increase in STI risk.==== When we examine the female sample by marital status, we find that married women are more likely to have an extramarital partner following a shock, while unmarried women increase their number of sexual partners and have a three-fold increase in the likelihood of being paid for sex. For men, while shocks led to estimated reductions in the likelihood of STIs and sexual activity (including the likelihood of paying for sex), all of our estimates are imprecise. These results suggest that with regard to the market for transactional sex, the supply side is much more responsive to negative shocks than the demand side.====The increase in STI rates for women exposed to negative shocks presents a public health challenge. While STIs have high individual health costs====, negative externalities are also being generated; individuals who become infected with STIs increase STI-prevalence in the community making unprotected sex riskier for everyone (Gersovitz and Hammer, 2003).==== Thus, there is an important role for policy interventions that can potentially mitigate the risk-coping behaviors we document. One popular tool is the use of conditional cash transfers (CCTs) to change individual behavior. Given that our study uses a sample participating in a CCT and that the transfers are linked to testing negative for STIs, it is natural to examine whether those randomly assigned to the CCT arm have a differential response to negative shocks. Surprisingly, we find no evidence that CCTs attenuate either STI risk or sexual behaviors for women experiencing a negative shock. This finding is puzzling. One explanation is that the credit and savings constraints that the women in our study face are quite binding. One example of this is that two-thirds of the women in our study are either unable to or unaware of anybody they can borrow money from in the event of a medical emergency. When negative shocks occur, the cash needs are immediate, while the cash transfers from the CCT are paid out at a specific point in time (only every four months in the RESPECT design). This mismatch in timing may induce women to engage in transactional sex even when they face financial incentives to do otherwise.====Our study’s first main finding that women’s sexual behaviors are much more responsive to negative shocks than men contributes to the literature that documents linkages between economic factors and sex in the context of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa.==== Studies that look at economy-wide aggregate effects have found that negative shocks such as post-election crises (Dupas and Robinson, 2012) and droughts (Burke et al., 2014) led to increases in either transactional sex or HIV infections, while positive shocks such as the copper mining boom in Zambia (Wilson, 2012) result in a decrease in transactional sex. All of these studies document general equilibrium effects (shocks affecting both sides of the market) that suggest that income shocks produce a larger response on the supply side than the demand side. Given that our study documents partial-equilibrium responses to shocks by gender, our results provide micro-level evidence in support of this conjecture.====Our study also contributes to the literature that assesses whether CCT interventions can effectively reduce risky sexual behaviors. CCT programs that condition transfers on biological markers (STIs or HIV status) of risky sex have had mixed success. While De Walque et al. (2012) (from which our study sample is derived) finds that CCTs can lead to reductions in STI risk, Kohler and Thornton (2011) find no effect of CCTs on the likelihood of HIV infection. Interestingly, Kohler and Thornton (2011) do find that after transfers were paid out, men increase, and women decrease their self-reported sexual behaviors. Our finding that CCTs do not appear to mitigate the risk-coping response by women (in the form of risky sex) may help us understand why CCTs have had limited success. In addition to the standard reasons on why CCTs may not be effective at changing sexual behavior including: 1) cash amounts are too small, 2) hyperbolic discounting, and 3) credibility of receiving the transfers, we add an additional problem that many women face in sub-Saharan Africa – how to cope with negative shocks when there are credit and savings constraints and the payout of the CCT is in the future.====A final related literature that we contribute to is the use of transfers that indirectly target sexual behavior. Two prominent studies have found that transfers either in the form of cash or educational subsidies have led to reductions in STIs. Baird et al. (2012) finds that both conditional and unconditional cash transfers given to schoolgirls in Malawi were effective at decreasing both HIV and HSV-2 prevalence. Meanwhile, Duflo et al. (2015) show that educational subsidies combined with an HIV-curriculum significantly reduce HSV-2 rates amongst school aged girls in Kenya. These two studies, in particular Baird et al. (2012), provide evidence that positive income shocks can lead to reductions in risky sexual behavior by women.====Before we proceed, we want to acknowledge the important limitations to our work. First, the study was not pre-specified to address our research question. While our data comes from an RCT, the research question was formulated and the analysis was done ex-post.==== Second, our negative shock measure that uses data on food insecurity is not ideal; it relies on individuals to report this and raises endogeneity concerns. The most obvious concern is that food insecurity is measuring overall poverty levels; all our analysis includes individual fixed effects, and thus we rely on changes in food insecurity and not overall levels. We also show that there is a significant association between our shock measure and actual expenditures and do a series of robustness checks. While we believe that our results are most consistent with the notion that negative shocks are leading women to increase their risky sexual behavior, we acknowledge that we cannot fully rule out all potential confounders. We note that food insecurity is a wide spread problem in sub-Saharan Africa (Smith et al., 2006), and food insecurity is a leading impetus for women to enter the market for transactional sex (Miller et al., 2011; Weiser et al., 2007).====A third limitation is that our data was collected in the context of an RCT where CCTs were used to change sexual behavior. Study individuals, particular those assigned to the CCT treatment arm, were primed to be thinking about reducing their sexual behavior. While our shock measure is not correlated with assignment to the CCT treatment group, our findings do need to be interpreted in this context. A fourth limitation is that we are unable to make the final link between food insecurity and HIV infection. While increases in STIs suggest the possibility of greater HIV infection risk since it involves unprotected sex, the STIs in our study and HIV are not perfectly correlated. We also face data constraints when looking directly at HIV; we only observe HIV status in 2 rounds of the data and overall prevalence in the sample is low (∼3%). We therefore have limited power to detect the effect of shocks on HIV infection.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the study and data collection, Section 3 presents our empirical framework, Section 4 presents the STI results, Section 5 presents the results on self-reported sexual behavior, Section 6 presents the effects of the CCT, Section 7 presents the effects by marital status, and Section 8 concludes.","Coping with risk: Negative shocks, transactional sex, and the limitations of conditional cash transfers",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629618305162,3 August 2019,2019,Research Article,287.0

Our paper tests the neoclassical prediction that a fully forward-looking agent only responds to their expected end-of-year price. Our unique identification strategy ==== during the year of ,"Health care spending in the United States has seen rapid growth in recent decades, reaching almost 18% of GDP in 2015. A common approach to limit demand-side overspending is exposing consumers to greater cost-sharing in the form of annual deductibles, which require consumers to pay 100% of medical expenses up to the deductible amount out-of-pocket before any coinsurance begins. In recent years, the share of employer-provided health plans without deductibles has been decreasing over time, and the average deductible amount in deductible-based plans has been growing every year – all while health insurance premiums have continued to rise. Average annual deductible amounts have increased from $917 in 2010 to $1318 in 2015 (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2015).====However, annual deductibles introduce non-linear pricing into the insurance contract, for which the consumer response is not well understood. The current “spot price” consumers face at any given point in time could differ from the expected end-of-year “future price” (or shadow price) depending on whether the consumer has satisfied their annual deductible or not. Many previous studies, including the RAND health insurance experiment==== assume a single fixed medical price for consumers (e.g. such as the average out-of-pocket cost), but whether this is a realistic assumption depends on how forward-looking consumers are in responding to non-linear insurance contracts.====Our paper studies childbirth, a high-cost and anticipated health event, and focuses on fathers on a family health insurance plan during the year of childbirth. Due to the existence of family deductibles, which are often two times the individual deductible amount, each family member's contribution to their individual deductible also counts toward satisfying the family deductible. Once the sum of total deductible spending reaches the family deductible amount, all members on the family plan receive cost sharing. Therefore, a childbirth event (including prenatal care, pregnancy, and newborn costs) directly contributes to the family deductible and thus the father's eligibility for coinsurance.====After verifying that fathers who reach their deductible do indeed utilize more medical care during the year of childbirth, we test whether they do so in a way that exhibits forward-looking behavior. A fully forward-looking individual recognizes their expected after-deductible future price and should respond to cost sharing even before reaching their deductible, resulting in smooth spending over the calendar year. In contrast, a myopic individual that only responds to their current spot price would behave as if their price has suddenly dropped after reaching their deductible, even though this information is known throughout the pregnancy. Due to endogenous timing of hitting the deductible, we instrument for hitting the deductible with the month of childbirth. The timing of childbirth does not affect expected future price, but earlier birth months cause end-of-year prices to be realized earlier, causing families to spend more and reach their deductible earlier. We estimate that fathers increase monthly utilization by 11% and have 0.03 more day-encounters – the number of unique days with a medical claim – per month in the months after hitting their deductible.====We also control for any effects the birth itself may have on health care demand. For example, paternity leave may free up time for health services, or individuals could place higher value on their own health after becoming a father. To control for this, we fix event time and compare 30 day post-childbirth medical utilization of fathers who reach their deductible precisely on the day of childbirth with fathers who reached their deductible before the birth. With this approach, any differences between the two groups can be attributed to spot-price responses. To instrument for the endogenous timing of hitting the deductible before versus at birth, we use the number of members on the family plan, as family deductible amounts are fixed regardless of the number of enrolled individuals. We find that fathers experiencing a decrease in spot price due to childbirth spend approximately 39% more and have 0.37 more day-encounters with the health system in the 30-day period after birth than those that already reached the coinsurance arm. This shows that the uptick in medical spending and utilization is not simply capturing post-childbirth spending, but rather spending due to receiving coinsurance.====After rejecting the null of fully forward-looking behavior, we quantify the degree of myopic behavior on a spectrum between fully forward-looking and fully myopic. We build a framework to assess the degree of myopia by exploiting the fact that the timing of the birth will create variation in the number of post-deductible months (the number of months an individual is over the deductible and eligible for coinsurance) for the father. This framework yields a prediction that a fathers’ total annual spending would not depend on the number of post-deductible months if he is fully forward-looking. In contrast, under fully myopic behavior, the fathers’ total annual medical spending will be proportional to the number of post-deductible months. Our results suggest fathers are highly myopic during the year of a childbirth, which translates to a total annual spending reduction of 21–24%, or $289–$372. We further investigate the differential response by type of procedures and find that the increased post-deductible spending is primarily concentrated in elective procedures and preventive care. There is no response along the urgent or low-value care margin.====Our paper is related to two main strands of literature. First, there is a large empirical literature estimating the demand for medical care with respect to price. Most studies either assume a single fixed medical price or incorporate non-linear pricing while assuming individuals are rational, forward-looking consumers that only respond to the expected future price.==== Within this literature, our study is most closely related to Brot-Goldberg et al. (2017), which finds that employees who are switched from free full coverage to a high-deductible health plan reduce their consumption of medical care while under the deductible. This result is consistent even in the sickest consumers who, if forward-looking, should recognize that they will reach the coinsurance arm regardless of initial spending reductions. Our paper also documents differences in spending behavior while under the deductible, and we leverage the variation in number of months under the deductible caused by differences in month of birth – an unique identification strategy. Additionally, our sample of consumers is more broadly representative of the U.S. population and we have representation from a wide variety of health plans. Another frequently studied phenomenon in the medical pricing literature is Medicare Part D's “donut hole” (Einav et al., 2015, Dalton et al., 2017, Abaluck et al., 2018), and studies have found substantial myopia in elderly patients making prescription drug purchases. We show similar myopic behavior with respect to health care spending in the year of childbirth, a major yet common non-elderly health event. Our broad set of privately insured consumers are a more representative sample than previous studies that focus on employees of a single firm, sicker high-spending patients, and/or the elderly.====Secondly, there is a growing literature on consumer responsiveness to non-linear budget sets that our paper also fits into.==== Non-linear budget sets create dynamic incentives (i.e. the distinction between spot and future price) and raise the question of whether consumers are forward-looking. This has been studied in the durable goods market, with Chevalier and Goolsbee (2009) focusing on used college textbooks and Saengchote and Nakavachara (2017) investigating used iPhones. Both papers looked at goods that follow predictable revisions and upgrades, and find evidence of forward-looking behavior. In the context of health insurance, Aron-Dine et al. (2015) identify differences in expected end-of-year prices (while fixing the current spot price) due to timing of new hires enrolling in employer-provided health insurance plans, and reject the null that consumers are completely myopic in their response to future prices. We view our research question and design as analogous: Instead of testing for fully myopic behavior, we test for fully forward-looking behavior by varying the spot price while fixing the expected end-of-year price.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides background on our setting and the structure of family health insurance plans. Section 3 details our data and sample construction, and Section 4 outlines our research design. Section 5 presents our main results testing for forward looking behavior, and Section 6 quantifies the degree of myopia. Section 7 concludes by discussing potential explanations for the observed myopic behavior.",What to expect when you are expecting: Are health care consumers forward-looking?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629618305289,17 July 2019,2019,Research Article,288.0

Exploiting temporal and geographic variation in the implementation of the ACA as well as pre-treatment differences in uninsured rates, we estimate that the expansions of private and ","Ever since the publication of Arrow (1963) seminal article, economists have explored and deliberated the appropriate role of government in health insurance markets. With the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010 and subsequent, high-profile repeal efforts, this question has also risen to the forefront of public policy debates. While the effects of health insurance expansions on utilization and other patient outcomes have been studied extensively, less attention has been paid to the supply-side of the market and whether provider capacity constraints create challenges as the demand for medical care increases. The current study explores one of the potential capacity challenges caused by expanding insurance coverage. Specifically, our interest is in estimating the effect of the ACA on ambulance response times.====The ACA was intended to achieve nearly universal health insurance coverage through a combination of insurance market reforms, mandates, and government subsidies. Insurers operating in the non-group insurance market were prohibited from denying coverage and pricing based on health, while individuals were required to obtain insurance coverage or pay a tax penalty. The ACA also expanded Medicaid to 138% of the Federal Poverty Line (FPL), while providing subsidies for purchasing coverage through private insurance “Marketplaces” (Gruber, 2011).==== A 2012 Supreme Court decision made the Medicaid expansion component of the ACA optional, and, as of May 2017, 19 states had opted out.====A number of studies have documented a sharp increase in health insurance coverage in 2014, the year in which the major components of the ACA took effect (Long et al., 2014; Smith and Medalia, 2015; Barnett and Vornovitsky, 2016; Courtemanche et al., 2016; McMorrow et al., 2016). Such an increase should, in theory, increase the amount of medical care demanded by reducing its out-of-pocket price.==== The extent to which this increase actually translates into health care utilization depends, however, on the supply-side response, which could be limited by barriers to entry such as licensing requirements, the capital costs of medical facilities and equipment, and the extensive regulations governing the construction of new medical facilities. A substantial body of research has shown that the United States is currently experiencing acute shortages of health care providers, particularly in the primary care sector (Ku et al., 2009; Bodenheimer and Pham, 2010; Juraschek et al., 2012; Dall et al., 2017), and projections indicate that these shortages will be exacerbated as a result of the ACA (Ku et al., 2009; Sargen et al., 2011; Huang and Finegold, 2013). If health care providers cannot meet the additional demand for their services generated by expanding insurance coverage, both newly insured patients and patients who were previously covered might experience difficulty in accessing care, undermining the case for expansion (Hofer et al., 2011; Kirch et al., 2013; Miller and Wherry, 2017).====We contribute to the small but growing literature on the capacity challenges facing providers after insurance expansions by investigating the effect of the ACA on ambulance response times.==== Our work provides the first estimates of the effect of coverage expansion under the ACA on wait times for any type of medical service. Although a literature exists on emergency room wait times and the practice of diverting ambulances to other hospitals in an effort to avoid overcrowding (====. Schull et al., 2003; Wilper et al., 2008), only four previous studies, by David and Harrington (2010); Jena et al. (2017), and Lambert and Meyer (2006 and 2008), explored the determinants of ambulance response times. These authors did not examine the effects of expanding insurance coverage.====Ambulance response times provide an appealing context in which to study congestion because ambulance assignment is essentially unrelated to the severity of a patient’s condition. When a geographical area is served by multiple ambulance companies, which is increasingly the case in major cities, dispatch is based on rotational assignment rather than specialization or the severity of the cases already being handled by the company (Doyle et al., 2015).==== Once a company is assigned, triage opportunities are constrained by limited patient information combined with the inability to reassign ambulances once a patient is being transported (Robertson-Steel, 2006; Widgren and Jourak, 2011). Other emergency services can, if necessary, reallocate resources to prioritize newly arrived patients. By contrast, if the nearest ambulance is transporting a patient when it receives a call, another ambulance must be assigned regardless of the new patient’s condition.====Both Medicaid and Marketplace plans cover emergency medical services (Folger, 2015),==== and enrollment in a public insurance program was a strong predictor of using ambulance transport to the emergency room prior to the passage of the ACA (Rucker et al., 1997; Larkin et al., 2006).==== If demand for ambulance services increased as a result of the ACA, there are several reasons to suspect that the supply-side response may have been muted, particularly in the short run. First, emergency medical service (EMS) personnel require considerable education and training, as well as certification, and there is evidence that shortages of these personnel existed even before the ACA took effect (Halpern, 2010).==== Second, new ambulances can cost between $100,000 and $200,000, representing a major investment for emergency medical service providers (Lindberg, 2011). Finally, relative to, for instance, primary care physicians or dentists, the capital-intensive nature of ambulance services makes meeting new demand through working longer hours more difficult, and shortening visits in an effort to accommodate more patients is not an option available to EMS providers. Because the ACA was fully implemented only recently, we cannot explore its long-run impact on ambulance response times.====We begin by revisiting the effect of the ACA on insurance coverage, which can be thought of as our first stage. Following Courtemanche et al. (2017a), we draw upon ACS data and adopt a triple-difference identification strategy that exploits temporal and geographic variation in the implementation of the ACA as well as pre-treatment differences in uninsured rates. There are, however, two key differences between our analysis and that of Courtemanche et al. (2017a). First, we use pre-ACA insured rates at the county level rather than the core-based statistical area (CBSA) level. Second, we add a second year (2015) of post-treatment data. Not surprisingly, our results are quite similar to those of Courtemanche et al. (2017a). We find that the ACA increased health insurance coverage by 4–5 percentage points in states that expanded Medicaid and by 2–3 percentage points in non-expansion states. The effect of the ACA on insurance coverage appears to have been stronger in 2015 than it was in 2014.====Next, we examine the impact of the ACA on ambulance response times using data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) for the period 2010–2015 and the same research design as was used to estimate the effects of the ACA on health insurance coverage. In the FARS data, which are at the level of the motor vehicle accident, we observe the time elapsed between notification and when the first ambulance arrived on the scene.====Our results suggest that the ambulance response times increased substantially with the implementation of the ACA. Specifically, our preferred estimates suggest that the expansions of private and Medicaid coverage under the ACA combined to slow ambulance response times by more than two minutes, or approximately 24% at the average pre-treatment (i.e., pre-ACA) uninsured rate.====Finally, we turn our attention to estimating the effect of the ACA on EMS vs. non-EMS dispatches. Using data for the period 2009–2016 from 18 municipalities across the United States, we find that the implementation of the ACA is associated with approximately 2000 additional EMS dispatches per quarter, or an 8–9% increase at the at the average pre-treatment uninsured rate. This result, combined with those of various robustness checks, leads us to conclude that, through extending coverage to individuals who would have otherwise not availed themselves of emergency medical services, the ACA led to a substantial increase in ambulance response times.",The affordable care act and ambulance response times,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629618300523,9 July 2019,2019,Research Article,289.0

An expanding international literature has documented the adverse health impacts of economic insecurity on adults, but has typically neglected children. This paper uses the natural experiment of SOE reform to explore the causal relationship between increased parental economic insecurity and children's BMI ","Numerous authors have argued that economic insecurity has been on a gradual rise since the 1970s in many countries,==== with adverse implications for family dissolution (Larson and Holman, 1994) and individual health (Rohde et al., 2016, Watson et al., 2016, Tsutsumi et al., 2001). Yet rarely has economic insecurity surged as dramatically and influentially as in China during the late 1990s. After almost 50 years of unequivocal “Iron Rice Bowl” guarantees of job security, 34 million workers were laid off between 1995 and 2001 in the reform of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), thereby massively heightening the insecurity of the 67 million continuing SOE employees.==== The magnitude and speed of these changes were historically unprecedented.====An expanding literature has argued that greater economic insecurity increases weight gain in adults in developed countries (Smith et al., 2009, Offer et al., 2010, Watson et al., 2016, Rohde et al., 2017). However, disentangling the causal impacts of increased economic insecurity on health from other influences requires that we identify a plausible exogenous change in economic insecurity. This paper argues that SOE reform in China was an unanticipated change for the hundred-million employees affected, and caused change in family circumstances that was exogenous for their children. We therefore exploit the natural experiment of SOE reform to examine the causal relationship between changes in economic insecurity and child outcomes.====Our innovations include (1) examination of the causal intergenerational effects of economic insecurity; (2) hypothetical counterfactual analysis suggesting that without the layoff policy, there would be a 2.2-percentage-point lower probability of affected children being overweight; (3) separation of the impacts of anticipation of job loss from the actual experience (we find evidence of weight gain for children whose parents were not actually laid off, highlighting the negative impact of anxiety about job loss); (4) examination of gender differences in the types of child impacts (the Body Mass Index ====-score==== increases significantly for boys but not for girls); (5) testing whether already heavier children gain more weight (which suggests more negative consequences for overweight and obese children); and (6) investigation of the health impacts of economic insecurity in an emerging economy, China.====We use total observed SOE layoffs at the province-year level as our measure of exogenous variation of economic insecurity, and non-SOEs as a control group, as the policy change only applied to SOE employees.==== Our generalised difference-in-differences (DID) methodology (two-way fixed-effects model) differences out unobserved pre-existing variations between the SOE (treated group) and the non-SOE (control group), thus providing accurate estimates on the difference in effects on children's BMI ====-score between high and low layoff intensity within the SOEs. Child fixed effects and year fixed effects are used to address omitted variable bias. Robustness checks control for specific provincial characteristics that could affect provinces differently over time. Since there is a possibility that in general equilibrium, the non-SOEs (control group) could have been affected by the SOE layoffs, we argue that this paper presents a lower-bound estimate of impacts. Finally, we employ unconditional quantile regressions to show that heavy boys gain more weight, while thin boys are not significantly affected by the layoffs.====Section 2 gives a brief background of the SOE reform and the exogeneity of the layoff policy, followed by discussion of the mechanisms that connect health and economic insecurity in Section 3.

In the OECD, only Chile, Germany, Mexico and the United States have dual systems of private and public insurers for primary health care (OECD, 2015). Chile has a private health insurance system that in terms of share of individuals covered is second in size only to the United States in the OECD, though the public system in the U.S. is restricted to those eligible for Medicare or Medicaid coverage only. Dual systems also exist in Argentina, Colombia, Peru and Venezuela in Latin America (Atun et al., 2014).====Chile began introducing important changes in several areas of social safety net programs in the beginning of the 2000s. Chile's experience with these various reforms can provide useful lessons on the impact of health care policy for countries considering similar changes. As in other nations in advanced stages of the demographic transition (i.e., experiencing low fertility and mortality rates, high development indices and ageing populations), the disease burden associated with chronic conditions is on the rise (Bitran et al., 2010). In fact, a major component in Chile's social safety-net reform is the introduction of the ==== or GES,==== implemented in 2005. This program provides guarantees to coverage and access to benefits for several health conditions, many of which are chronic.====Workers in Chile are required to contribute at least seven percent of their income to health insurance and can choose from either the public insurer (==== or FONASA====) or a private plan offered by a ==== or ISAPRE==== (they cannot choose to remain uninsured, as health insurance is mandatory by law). The structure of premiums, benefits and out-of-pocket medical costs differs between the two systems. First, while premiums increase with income for users in both systems, benefits improve for ISAPRE users, while remaining unchanged in the public system. Specifically, all FONASA members receive a uniform benefit package regardless of the premium paid. On the other hand, as premiums increase, plans in the private system are of higher quality, meaning better coverage, lower co-payments, fewer restrictions, lower yearly out-of-pocket limits, and other improvements. Put differently, all else equal, while users in the private system with higher incomes will pay more for health insurance, they will also typically experience, lower out-of-pocket medical costs, among other benefits.====Second, private insurance companies offer a wide variety of plans, and premiums depend on a set of basic health risk indicators of the individual and of his or her dependents. In the public system, on the other hand, the plan offered by FONASA is independent of the subscribers’ health risks. Third, private insurers often provide access to better technology and faster service, while the public system relies mostly on public hospitals and may have longer wait times. However, the public system can be heavily subsidized, especially for low-income individuals, as seven percent of their incomes allows them to purchase the public plan at a premium that may be below its actuarially fair value.====As a consequence of this complex structure, adverse selection may arise. Specifically, holding all else equal (including the quality of health plans), riskier individuals may be more inclined to choose public insurance since, unlike in the private system, premiums do not increase with health risk or the number of dependents. On the other hand, wealthier individuals are more likely to select private insurance as the higher amounts they must devote for health insurance would allow them to purchase more comprehensive plans.====While individuals are allowed to switch between insurance types, the Chilean health care system presents some restrictions on preexisting conditions. Namely, applicants are mandated to declare any pre-existing illness before joining a private insurer, particularly for serious and/or chronic conditions. Therefore, developing a condition or illness while not covered by a private plan may be considered a pre-existing condition by insurance companies, which may limit future private coverage. Denying access to households with pre-existing conditions is the only economically viable option private insurers may have as they cannot set premiums using information on individuals’ health status. For a given level of plan quality, private insurers are allowed to determine premiums based only on differences in age, gender, and the number of dependents. The public system, on the other hand, does no impose such restrictions.====Mobility constraints due to pre-existing conditions suggest that insurance selection involves a dynamic process, as current insurance choices may affect future decisions. Namely, individuals may get stuck in one system or the other if they are or expect to be affected by adverse health changes, thus restricting their ability to make active insurance choices in the future. Specifically, (i) sicker individuals may tend to accumulate in the public system due to restricted public to private movement, and/or (ii) healthier people may be suboptimally “trapped” in the private system if they are concerned that possible changes in health while in the public system would prevent them from purchasing a private plan later in life. Therefore, individuals are likely to use all available information for their choices so that in the event of getting trapped in a system, it happens in the one they would consider at the time the better of the two options.====The guarantees provided by GES are not only expected to enhance access to more, better and faster treatments for users in both systems, but also to offer limits in out-of-pocket expenses, thus drastically reducing financial uncertainty due to health. Consequently, the introduction of GES may have some repercussions on the selection of health insurance by individuals, which are analyzed in the following section.====While the impact of a social safety-net reform can be studied from several viewpoints, examining its effects on health insurance selection could be of valuable interest. First, we can shed some light on the determinants and incentives involved in this type of decision and on how the reform may impact some individuals. Second, given that the health insurance market is markedly segmented in that people with high health risks and lower income have tended to accumulate in the public system, it may also be interesting to examine whether the reform could alter the mix of enrollees between systems. Changes in this respect can either alleviate or reinforce adverse selection problems and, therefore, have important fiscal and efficiency implications. Finally, as the presence of pre-existing condition clauses in the private system, but not in the public system, may imply dynamic decisions, we may learn whether the data confirm the existence of decision constraints and whether the reform may alter these constraints.====This paper builds and estimates a simple structural, dynamic choice model using panel data from Chile's “====” (EPS) survey.==== The model is one where past choices and current states can affect individuals’ present and future utility. Using a dynamic model to analyze this problem is particularly useful given that mobility restrictions crucially depend on past decisions and health states. As discussed earlier, while clauses on pre-existing conditions apply to the transition from public to private, mobility in the opposite direction is also indirectly impacted. Namely, there is an “option value” of staying in the private system because it guarantees future access to private insurance amenities regardless of the evolution of one's health. The reform could reinforce the stated option value since staying in the private system would also guarantee future access to such amenities for the conditions included in GES.====A dynamic model is also important because it factors in the expectations of the evolution of an individual's utility over time. That is, a dynamic analysis takes into account the fact that the described option value could strengthen on average over time because, as individuals get older and health tends to deteriorate, the likelihood of having to use the GES benefits offered by ISAPREs would increase. Likewise, the model would account for rising premiums in the private system as people age. Therefore, the evolution of both the option value (reinforced by the reform) and private insurance costs over time are factors that determine the present discounted value of an individual's lifetime utility and, therefore, both their current and future decisions. Naturally, those aspects can be best captured in a dynamic setting.====Finally, using a structural approach for modeling the behavior of a forward-looking individual would allow us to estimate some of the underlying parameters driving such behavior and to then predict decisions that individuals of certain characteristics are most likely to make under certain circumstances. In this case, we examine the evaluation of the GES reform from the perspective of its impact on health insurance selection. Specifically, by simulating individuals’ health insurance choices with and without the reform, this paper tests whether riskier and poorer individuals are in fact more likely to choose public insurance, whether the asymmetry in mobility restrictions affects such choices, whether individuals’ health insurance decisions change if restrictions on pre-existing conditions were to be eliminated and, finally, whether any of the above results are affected by the GES reform.====Estimation results suggest that those affected by pre-existing conditions are willing to pay to have access to private insurance, and that GES has significantly reduced out-of-pocket medical costs to those affected by the covered illnesses. Simulations on the impact of GES on insurance selection show an increase in public participation of about 3.8 percentage points on average over the sample period. The mandatory GES premium and the effective discontinuation of low health-risk plans in the private system seem to be behind this result. The predicted private to public migration is stronger for young, healthy and more educated males, which suggests that the reform may have eased adverse selection problems in this market. If pre-existing condition restrictions were to be eliminated, more high-risk individuals would move from the public to the private system, further alleviating adverse selection problems.====The presence of adverse selection in the Chilean health insurance system has been studied in several papers.==== There are also articles that have examined the impact of Chile's health care reform on health insurance selection. Dawes (2010), for instance, looks at the differential of the unconstrained probabilities of selecting private insurance between pre and post-reform samples. She finds that, though the reform alleviated segmentation caused by health risk and income, it also increased the likelihood that the average individual would choose public insurance. Pardo and Schott (2014) test the existence of adverse selection while controlling for an extensive set of individual characteristics. The authors conduct a qualitative analysis of the potential impact of the GES reform on health insurance choices. These articles, however, use static models.====There are dynamic models of health care choice in the literature. For example, Gilleskie and Mroz (2004) develop a dynamic optimization problem with health insurance for the U.S. Likewise, Blau and Gilleskie (2000) build a dynamic choice model of employment, insurance and health care consumption for workers close to retirement in the U.S. The authors also simulate the impact of health care reforms on employment decisions. Pardo and Schott (2012) develop and estimate a dynamic model of health insurance selection to test the presence of adverse selection in the context of asymmetries in mobility restrictions. These articles ask questions similar to those in this paper, but in the present analysis, attention is focused on how health insurance selection may be impacted by a major health care reform.====Finally, this paper is also related to Atal (2016), who also examines how the presence of pre-existing conditions creates inefficiencies in the Chilean health insurance market. Specifically, once in a private plan, individuals are guaranteed insurance for most negative health shocks as long as they stay with the same insurer. Consequently, individuals could find themselves suboptimally “locked-in” with their insurance companies, as any change could mean the loss of that guarantee. Atal finds that about 5% of individuals end up in such a situation. Apart from differences in the data sets, the two papers differ mainly in that Atal (2016) studies lock-ins within the private system, while this analysis examines barriers to movement between the private and the public systems.====The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 includes a brief description of the Chilean health care system and some relevant aspects of the GES reform. Section 3 presents the theoretical model and estimation method. Section 4 provides a description of the data and summary statistics of the estimation sample.

Using the exact timing of vaccination relative to ,"The United States experienced a dramatic decline in the incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases over the 20th century. This phenomenon, which resulted in substantial reductions in infant and child morbidity and mortality, is attributable in large part to the success of a large scale public health campaign to promote universal immunization (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1999). Though overall rates of vaccine coverage in the U.S. have been high in recent decades, disparities in immunization coverage have persisted across socioeconomic and racial groups. In particular, children who are poor, black, and from low-income neighborhoods, and those with younger, less-educated, and unmarried mothers are more likely to fall behind the recommended schedule for childhood vaccines (Feemster et al., 2009, Luman et al., 2005).====In this paper, we examine the determinants of parental decisions about infant immunization, exploring the roles of perceived disease risk, attitudes about vaccination, and healthcare provider contact for vaccine takeup in the first year of life. We focus on the timing of a child's ==== immunization doses for two reasons. First, the period encompassing pregnancy and early infancy is a time when many parents form opinions about vaccination and establish healthcare patterns for their children. Since most of the vaccines given to infants are part of a sequence, obtaining the first set of immunizations on time might help establish a routine with a care provider and make it more likely that subsequent vaccines will be received on time as well. Second, vaccine delay is an important contributor to disparities in vaccination rates along socioeconomic and demographic dimensions. Many children, particularly those in disadvantaged families, will ultimately end up fully vaccinated by the time they start school but will experience substantial delays in their vaccination schedules during infancy and early childhood. As infants and toddlers have the highest likelihood of contracting vaccine-preventable diseases and of experiencing serious complications from them, vaccine delay has potentially-serious health implications (Feemster et al., 2009, Luman et al., 2005).====We begin by examining whether local outbreaks of a vaccine-preventable illness affect the rate of on-time initiation of immunization for that illness at two months of age. Estimating the immunization response to outbreaks provides important insight into the role of perceived disease risk in influencing parents’ vaccination decisions. For some children, local outbreaks will raise the near-term risk of exposure to illness, increasing the health benefit from of on-time vaccination. Outbreaks also make disease risk more salient overall, possibly providing updated information to parents who previously underestimated the risk of illness (Oster, 2018). In order to explore whether information about disease risk affects infant immunization, we construct outbreak indicators using weekly state-level counts of pertussis (whooping cough) cases from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and link them to child-level data from the National Immunization Survey. Using exact date of birth and the timing of each vaccine dose relative to birth date, we estimate the effects of pertussis outbreaks that occur in utero and during the first two months of life on the likelihood that the first dose of the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTaP) vaccine is received within 75 days of birth.====We find that parents respond to increases in perceived disease risk—a local pertussis outbreak occurring in utero or between birth and two months of age increases the probability that an infant's first pertussis immunization occurs on-time. Splitting our sample along demographic and socioeconomic dimensions, we find that the increase in on-time vaccination at two months is entirely concentrated among children in low-income households, minority children, children with less-educated mothers, and children of unmarried mothers. We find no significant effects of outbreaks on the likelihood of on-time initiation of infant immunization among children in non-poor families, white children, or children with college-educated mothers. We confirm that these results are robust across different regression specifications and for a variety of outbreak definitions.====In the second part of our study, we explore whether pertussis outbreaks affect the likelihood that infants receive vaccines for ==== diseases on time. Estimating the spillover effects of pertussis outbreaks allows us to gain insight into the role of information and the importance of healthcare provider contact in influencing parental decisions about immunization. First, we examine whether a pertussis outbreak increases on time receipt of other vaccines that are recommended to be given at the same age as the first DTaP dose (polio and Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib)). We find that when a pertussis outbreak induces low-SES parents to vaccinate their infants against pertussis, their likelihood of obtaining the other vaccines offered at the same age increases by almost as much. As an outbreak of pertussis does not cause an increase in the likelihood of contracting other diseases, these effects are likely attributable either to changes in perceptions about vaccination and disease resulting from the outbreak or to reductions in the time cost or other healthcare access costs that result from seeking out the pertussis vaccine.====In order to gain further insight into the mechanisms driving parental vaccination decisions, we next estimate the effect of pertussis outbreaks in utero on the likelihood that a child receives immunizations that are typically recommended to be received at ==== visits from the initial DTaP dose—immunizations at birth for hepatitis-B and immunizations for varicella, and measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) around 12–15 months of age. Importantly, we find that pertussis outbreaks occurring in utero or in the first two months do ==== result in an increase in receipt of vaccinations for other disease at birth and at 12–15 months. This finding suggests that the increase in the two-month immunizations is not the result of broad changes in attitudes or information about vaccination or disease. In fact, for some groups, we find evidence of negative substitution effects: pertussis outbreaks lead to small decreases in the likelihood that these other vaccines are received during the recommended time frames.====While we cannot separately identify all possible mechanisms behind our results, the nature of the spillover effects that we find—positive spillovers for same-visit vaccines and substitution for different-visit vaccines—and the fact that they are concentrated in disadvantaged groups with lower baseline use of medical care suggest that contact with healthcare providers may be an important factor contributing to lower on-time vaccination. Our hypothesis about the importance of provider contact is supported by reports from low-income focus-groups (Coker et al., 2009, Lannon et al., 1995), additional evidence of cross-visit substitution related to vaccination (Fiks et al., 2008), and the results from our own exploration of socioeconomic disparities in infant medical care use, access to quality medical care, and the characteristics of vaccination visits from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS).====Our study complements recent studies of the immunization of older children by Oster (2018) and Carpenter and Lawler (2019). Oster studies the effects of pertussis outbreaks on the receipt of pertussis immunization among school-aged children using county-level data from 12 US states, and also finds that outbreaks increase immunization coverage. She finds weak spillover effects of pertussis outbreaks on immunization for measles among school-aged children and interprets them as evidence for overall changes in parents’ perceptions of vaccination. Carpenter and Lawler (2019) study the effects of state laws requiring a tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (TDaP) booster shot prior to middle school enrollment on immunization rates of middle school students, and also find evidence of cross-vaccination spillovers. In particular, they find that TDaP mandates increased adolescent vaccination rates for meningococcal disease and human papillomavirus—vaccines that are also recommended for adolescents—with larger effects in low-SES subgroups. Though neither of the papers on older children focuses on provider contact as the key reason for spillovers, the findings in both papers are consistent with our results for infants and our interpretation of them. In both settings, the vaccinations that experience positive spillovers can be received at the same visit as the primary vaccination.====The results from this paper have several important implications for health policy. First, we show that disease outbreaks affect the on-time initiation of infant immunization. This implies that dissemination of information about disease risk has the potential to increase rates of immunization coverage among very young infants—the population with the highest risk of serious complications from illness. Second, we find spillover effects of pertussis outbreaks on vaccination for other illnesses at the same visit, which implies that vaccine outreach programs and policies that help disadvantaged families to overcome the barriers associated with regular utilization of medical care in the first year of life may help to reduce the risk of vaccine delay. Finally, we find evidence of substitution across sets of vaccines that are received at different visits among some disadvantaged subgroups. That is, for black children and children with single mothers, the increase in the likelihood of obtaining the first set of vaccines on time at two months is accompanied by a reduction in the likelihood of obtaining a separate set of vaccines typically offered between 12 and 15 months. This finding suggests an important role for educating families about the importance of obtaining ==== of the recommended vaccines and doses and further highlights the importance of reducing barriers to consistent provider contact.","Disease outbreaks, healthcare utilization, and on-time immunization in the first year of life",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629617308986,6 July 2019,2019,Research Article,292.0

Few sectors of the economy have search costs as high as those in the health care industry. While price dispersion exists in many markets, the magnitude of price dispersion in health care markets combined with the lack of available price information imposes substantial burdens on consumers (Anderson et al., 2003, Cooper et al., 2018).==== Even motivated consumers face difficulty obtaining price estimates for health care providers (Rosenthal et al., 2013, Anthony, 2015). At the same time, if providers wanted to provide price quotes, they may not be able to readily assess the insurance characteristics that determine the costs of providing care to a given patient.==== Moreover, because insurance benefits have traditionally insulated consumers from marginal costs, the institutional mechanisms to provide patients with price estimates have not been developed.====The lack of readily available price information, combined with increasing patient cost-sharing, has prompted a move towards increased transparency of health care prices. More than 30 states require or are in the process of requiring either insurers or providers to make prices available to consumers (Sinaiko and Rosenthal, 2011, Sinaiko et al., 2015). Some states, most notably New Hampshire, maintain searchable websites of provider prices but use of these sites remains minimal and they have not been linked to changes in consumer behavior (Mehrotra et al., 2014, Tu and Lauer, 2009). At the same time, several private sector solutions have recently emerged. Several technology companies deliver personalized price information to consumers through internet-based applications. These applications display out-of-pocket provider prices and take into account benefit designs, networks, and other features that influence how patients choose providers. Price transparency technologies have become increasingly common and at least half of the commercially insured population now has access to some form of online health care price transparency (Phillips and Labno, 2014).====Yet, our understanding of the dynamic impacts of these technologies on one of the largest sectors of the U.S. economy remains limited. This paper examines if the growth of patient access to a leading online price transparency platform leads providers to change their prices. This paper builds on the work of Christensen et al. (2015), which examines provider responses to state price transparency laws. They find an approximately 6% decrease in hospital “chargemaster” prices but find no effect for the negotiated prices between providers and insurers. The lack of a price response to state policies is not surprising as nearly all state regulations require disclosure of hospital charges, rather than actual negotiated rates between hospitals and insurers.==== More recent work has found that the state-run New Hampshire site has an impact on prices for imaging services (Brown, 2017a, Brown, 2017b). This paper extends the existing literature by examining the effects of more actionable price transparency technologies on negotiated provider prices for common medical services. This is the first nationwide study to examine how health care providers respond to online price transparency tools.====To measure provider responses to price transparency information, I leverage micro-level data from several sources. Over the 2010–2014 period and for nearly all geographic markets in the United States, I measure both the diffusion and active use of a particular internet-based price transparency platform. The platform allows consumers to search for personalized and provider-specific negotiated prices for over 1000 medical procedures. It also displays information on provider quality, satisfaction ratings, and provides educational content on common diseases and conditions. Consumers gain access to the price transparency platform through their employer. At the end of the sample, approximately eight million individuals had access to the price transparency platform.====I supplement the price transparency data with unique and detailed administrative data on negotiated prices between providers and insurers. A key piece of this paper's identification strategy is the availability of provider-specific pricing data over the entire 2010–2014 period. The structure of the data allows me to construct a five-year longitudinal panel of quarterly provider prices for over 16,000 laboratory test providers and 90,000 office visit clinicians. This data contains the actual negotiated prices between a specific provider and insurer for a given procedure, rather than the chargemaster prices that have previously been used to evaluate provider responses to price transparency.====I combine both sources of data to estimate the within-provider price changes as access to price information becomes more widespread in each market. At the beginning of the panel, 2010, no providers faced consumers with access to the price transparency platform. However, by 2014, all provider markets contained at least some consumers with access to price transparency. At the end of the sample, 22% of the markets have penetration rates of at least 5% of the commercially insured population and in 10% of the markets, at least 10% of the commercially insured population has access to the price transparency platform.====The staggered diffusion of the transparency platform creates market-level variation in both the timing and the intensity of consumer access to price information and provider exposure to consumer price-shopping. This variation is driven by each employer's decision to purchase access to the price transparency platform and the corresponding decisions of neighboring firms. It is further driven by the types of firms that purchase the platform in each area. Contributing employers include large, self-insured employers from multiple industries and multiple geographic scopes. Some firms are concentrated in a single market while employees from other firms are spread across multiple markets. The variation in each employer's purchasing decision and the type of employer creates the identifying variation that I use to estimate provider responses to price transparency.====The most obvious way for price transparency to lead to lower prices is by allowing consumers to shop for low-price, high-quality providers. Lieber (2015) finds a 10–17% reduction in prices for consumers who use a telephone-based price transparency platform. Likewise, Wu et al. (2014) find an 18% reduction in MRI prices when price transparency information was combined with a prior-authorization program. In the same setting as this paper, Whaley et al. (2014) and Whaley (2015) show how price transparency allows consumers to shop for less expensive providers.==== Both papers find that searching for providers leads to an approximately 15% reduction in prices for homogenous services, laboratory tests, but a smaller, approximately 1%, reduction in prices for more heterogeneous services, office visits. These differences in the consumer responses are important to this paper. If providers respond to patient behavior, then we should expect little to no price changes for office services but larger price changes for laboratory tests. On the other hand, Desai et al. (2016) finds no meaningful change in spending following the introduction of a price transparency platform.====Anecdotal evidence from the hospital industry trade literature suggests that providers are aware of the potential effects of price transparency on consumer demand. One report warns that “hospital finance leaders should prepare for a potentially adverse revenue impact from … increasing demand for greater price transparency” (Myers, 2015). Empirical evidence supporting a reduction in provider prices can also be seen from the effect of the internet on firm prices for other goods. For example, Brynjolfsson and Smith (2000) find that book and CD prices are 9-16% lower for internet-based firms than for non-internet firms. In addition, Kolstad (2013) shows how disclosing provider quality information can lead to large provider changes even in the face of small consumer responses when health care providers are sensitive to reputational concerns inherent with price rankings.====At the same time, several economic concepts actually support the benefits of price obfuscation. Most notably, price transparency may facilitate tacit collusion. In markets with negotiated prices, price disclosure may provide firms with additional bargaining leverage to use against payers. Low-cost providers can use price transparency information to obtain an insurer's maximum willingness to pay. This information can thereby reduce the ability of insurers to selectively contract and thus lead to an increase in prices. This problem is exacerbated in markets with a small number of firms and markets with inelastic consumer demand (Stigler, 1964, Mollgaard and Overgaard, 1999).==== For this reason, many insurance contracts contain “gag clauses” that prohibit providers from disclosing prices.====As shown theoretically in Schultz (2009), the disconnect between the two potential effects of price transparency depends crucially on consumer price elasticities and product differentiation. If demand for medical services is price inelastic, then providers do not need to compete based on price. In such a case, revealing prices may have the unintended effect of enabling tacit collusion by setting benchmark prices. Similarly, if products are substantially differentiated, price transparency may not lead to price competition. Both factors are relevant to health care markets, which exhibit both low price elasticity and substantial product differentiation. In addition, the presence of insurance coverage further reduces consumer price sensitivity and thus increases the potential for price collusion among providers.==== The possibility that providers might respond to price transparency by raising prices has led some economists to warn against potential adverse effects of price transparency for health care markets (Cutler and Dafny, 2011).==== ====I examine changes in provider prices for two of the most common health care services, laboratory tests and office visit services.==== Laboratory tests account for 6.3% of medical spending among the commercially insured population and the services included in this analysis account for 32.9% (32.3%) of that share.==== Similarly, office visits account for 16.5%% of total spending and the procedure codes used in this study account for 32.3% of office visit spending. Office visit and laboratory services were chosen for two reasons. First, the previous consumer analysis shows large responses for lab tests and smaller responses for office visits. Because a conceptual model shows that the magnitude of the provider response depends on the magnitude of the consumer response, office-based clinicians serve as a falsification test for lab test providers. Second, the two types of providers vary in ways that influence how the literature suggests they should respond to price transparency. Office visit services are highly differentiated and include a meaningful quality component. In contrast, laboratory tests are homogenous, commodity-like services.====Similar to the consumer responses, I find small price changes for office visits but meaningful price reductions for laboratory tests. My main results imply that every 10 percentage point (10%) increase in access to the online price transparency platform leads to a 1.7% (0.3%) decrease in laboratory test prices, but does not lead to a change in office visit prices. These results are robust to a variety of specifications. I provide evidence that supports that these effects are driven by the price transparency platform's diffusion, and not other employer programs that may have been implemented contemporaneously. As a test of the underlying mechanism that leads to the provider price changes, I also add data on the share of individuals in each market that have created an account and actively used the price transparency platform. I find that provider responses to active use of the platform are larger in magnitude than responses to consumer access to the platform. Every 10% increase in the market-level share of the population that has actively created an account to the platform leads to a 0.5% reduction in laboratory test provider prices. This result suggests that providers do not simply respond to access to price transparency, but instead respond to consumers actively using price information.====This paper makes two main contributions to the economics literature. First, it provides the first look at the dynamic effects of a nascent technology in one of the largest and most complex sectors of the U.S. economy. This paper's results suggest that the broader move towards health care price transparency are warranted and have consumer benefits beyond just the consumer uses of technology. Second, this paper also addresses an important issue in economics. Starting with Stigler (1961) and Arrow (1963), economists have long recognized the importance of information asymmetries in health and other markets. From a policy perspective, this paper demonstrates how reducing consumer search costs spurs firm price competition in health care markets. This paper also demonstrates the limitations of health care price transparency as a means of reducing provider prices. While the reductions are in laboratory test prices are robust, they are relatively modest. I also find no change in prices for office visits.====The paper proceeds as follows. First, Section 2 provides an overview of the data and institutional setting. Section 3 provides the empirical tests of price transparency on provider prices. Section 4 estimates several alternative specifications and robustness tests. Section 5 examines the underlying mechanisms surrounding the provider responses and Section 6 concludes.",Provider responses to online price transparency,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629618310476,26 June 2019,2019,Research Article,293.0

We show that, whereas policies based on penalties will lead to lower waiting times, policies that promote patient choice will instead lead to higher waiting times. These results are robust to different game-theoretic solution concepts, designs of the hospital penalty structure, and patient utility specifications. Furthermore, waiting time penalties are likely to be more effective in reducing waiting times if they are designed with a linear penalty structure, but the counterproductive effect of patient choice policies is smaller when penalties are convex. These conclusions are partly derived by calibration of our model based on waiting times and elasticities observed in the English NHS for a common treatment (cataract surgery).","Waiting times for non-emergency (elective) treatments are a key health policy concern across OECD countries, such as Australia, Canada, Ireland, Finland, Norway, Portugal, and the United Kingdom. Mean waiting times range between 50 and 150 days across countries for common procedures such as cataract surgery, hip and knee replacement, hernia, hysterectomy, and prostatectomy (Siciliani et al., 2014). Although some countries like Finland and the UK have had successes in 2000–2005 in reducing waiting times from high levels (e.g., more than 150 days on average for hip and knee replacement), waiting times have stalled in most countries since the financial crisis and have slowly started to rise again in some countries. In countries like Chile, Poland, and Estonia, waiting times for hip and knee procedures are still above one year (OECD, 2017).====Waiting times are a major source of dissatisfaction for patients since they postpone health benefits, may worsen symptoms, deteriorate patients’ conditions, and lead to worse clinical outcomes. In response to the dissatisfaction that they generate, governments have taken a variety of measures to reduce waiting times. Many OECD countries have adopted some form of maximum waiting time guarantees (Siciliani et al., 2013a). However, the design and implementation of these guarantees can differ significantly across countries.====Two common approaches are to link maximum wait guarantees either to penalties or to competition (and patient choice) policies. The first approach was followed by Finland and England, which combined maximum waiting times with sanctions for failure to fulfil the guarantee. Targets with penalties were introduced in England in 2000–05 with political oversight from the Prime Ministerial Delivery Unit and the Health Care Commission. Senior health administrators risked losing their jobs if targets were not met. As a result, the proportion of patients waiting over six months was reduced by 6–9 percentage points (Propper et al., 2008b). In 2010, maximum wait guarantees became a patient entitlement codified into the NHS Constitution, establishing a patient right to a maximum of 18 weeks from GP referral to treatment. In Finland, waiting time guarantees were combined with targets as part of the Health Care Guarantee in 2005, subsequently included in the 2010 Health Care Act. A National Supervisory Agency supervised the implementation of the guarantee through targets and penalised municipalities failing to comply. The number of patients waiting over six months was reduced from 12.6 per 1000 population in 2002 to 6.6 per 1000 in 2005 (Siciliani et al., 2013a).====The second approach involves combining maximum waiting time guarantees with patient choice and competition policies. For example, in Denmark, if the hospital foresees that the maximum waiting time guarantee will not be fulfilled, the patient can choose another public or private hospital. In Portugal, when a patient on the waiting list reaches 75% of the maximum guaranteed time, a voucher that allows the patient to seek treatment at any other provider, including private sector providers, is issued. In several countries, like England and Norway, patients are free to choose any provider within the country (Siciliani et al., 2017).====From an economics perspective, waiting times act as a non-price rationing device to bring into equilibrium the demand for and the supply of health care in publicly-funded health systems. Many countries with a National Health Service or public health insurance combine the absence of co-payments with the presence of capacity constraints. As a result, an excess demand arises, which translates into a waiting list. One way to bring the demand for and the supply of treatments into equilibrium is to rely on waiting times. As argued by Lindsay and Feigenbaum (1984), Martin and Smith (1999), and Iversen, 1993, Iversen, 1997, waiting times tend to discourage demand if patients give up the treatment or opt for treatment in the private sector. Waiting times may also influence positively the supply of health services if altruistic providers exert greater effort and treat more patients when waiting times are higher.====In the present study, we investigate whether competition and patient choice policies play a useful role in reducing waiting times, and the extent to which such a role is altered in the presence of penalties for providers with long waits. Our model is dynamic to capture a key feature of the waiting time phenomenon. Waiting times tend to increase when demand for treatment is higher than the supply of treatment so that new patients are added to the waiting list. Similarly, waiting times tend to reduce when more patients are removed from the waiting list than those added. A second feature of our model is that hospitals compete for patients, with hospitals with lower waiting times attracting more patients.====The combination of a dynamic approach with strategic interactions across providers calls for a differential-game approach. Although we solve the model for both open-loop and closed-loop decision rules (Dockner et al., 2000), our main analysis is based on the arguably more realistic feedback (closed-loop) solution, where hospitals can observe (and react to) waiting times at each point in time, implying that supply decisions can be continuously revised based on the evolution of waiting times. Under open-loop decision rules, hospitals compute their optimal supply paths at the beginning of the game and are restricted to follow such plans thereafter. It seems plausible that hospitals can adjust supply over time in response to the dynamics of waiting times (own and those of rival hospitals).====To model the demand for healthcare faced by each provider, we use a Hotelling approach with two hospitals located at each endpoint of the unit line segment. We adopt a general specification, which allows for two types of patients who differ in the valuation of their outside option (e.g., to seek treatment in the private sector or to forego treatment altogether), which in turn implies different net benefits, high and low, from hospital treatment. Hospitals compete on the segment of demand with high benefit, while they are local monopolists on the demand segment with low benefit.====Our main aim is to investigate the effect of policies that facilitate ====, commonly interpreted as policies that stimulate competition, and how such policies interact with policies based on waiting time penalties. Within our analytical framework, patient choice policies are modelled as a reduction in patients’ transportation costs, which makes each hospital's demand more responsive to changes in waiting times and is a standard competition measure in spatial competition models. The effect of such policies is studied in contexts where waiting time penalties are either ==== in waiting times or ==== in waiting times, with the marginal penalty increasing with waiting.====We obtain several policy relevant findings. Importantly, we find that policies to increase patient choice lead to ==== steady-state waiting times as long as hospitals suffer a disutility from positive waiting times. Increased patient choice makes demand more responsive to changes in waiting times, which implies that a unilateral reduction in waiting time at one hospital will lead to a larger demand increase for this hospital. This implies, in turn, that it becomes more difficult for each hospital to reduce waiting times through a unilateral increase in the supply of treatments. In other words, patient choice policies reduce the effectiveness of treatment supply as an instrument to reduce waiting times. The policy implication of this result is that patient choice policies are counterproductive, in terms of reducing waiting times, in the presence of waiting time penalties. Moreover, higher waiting penalties make patient choice policies even more counterproductive. We also show that a combined policy of more patient choice and higher waiting time penalties will lead to higher waiting times if the waiting time penalty is sufficiently high to begin with.====The above described results are derived analytically for the case of constant marginal provider disutility of waiting time, for example because of linear waiting time penalties. For the case of convex waiting time penalties, a closed-form solution cannot be obtained, and our results are therefore numerically derived. To make the results more salient, we calibrate our model based on waiting times observed in the English NHS for a common treatment (cataract surgery). The calibration is also informed by demand elasticities which have been estimated in the empirical literature (Martin and Smith, 1999, Sivey, 2012).====The calibration output shows that our main result, that patient choice policies lead to higher waiting times, also carries over to the case of convex waiting time penalties. This comes as no surprise, the intuition behind this result does not rely on the shape of the provider disutility function but rather on the responsiveness of demand to waiting times. Not only is this result robust to the design of the waiting time penalty structure, it holds under a fairly general patient utility specification and is independent of the choice of game-theoretic solution concept, as it arises also under open-loop decision rules.====However, under closed-loop rules (where hospitals can observe and react to waiting times at each point in time), convex waiting time penalties introduce an additional strategic effect by creating ==== in supply. This implies that lower treatment supply by one hospital will be optimally met by increased supply by the competing hospital, which dampens the initial increase in waiting time caused by the supply reduction. This strategic substitutability gives each hospital an incentive to reduce its supply in order to ‘free-ride’ on the subsequent supply increase by the other hospital. The policy implication of this result is that, all else equal, waiting time penalties are likely to be more effective in reducing waiting times if they are designed with a linear penalty structure. On the other hand, we also show that the counterproductive effect of patient choice policies is smaller when penalties are convex instead of linear, which gives rise to yet another inherent conflict between these two policies. Waiting time penalties are more effective if they are linear, but linear penalties make patient choice policies more counterproductive.====The rest of the study is organised as follows. In the next section, we present a brief overview of the literature and explain how we contribute to it. In Section 3, we present the model, whereas the main analysis, based on the closed-loop solution, is given in Section 4. Section 5 considers patient welfare.

Exploiting time-series variation in independent prescriptive authority for NPs from 1990 to 2014, we find that broadening prescriptive authority leads to improvements in self-reported mental health and decreases in mental health–related mortality. These improvements are concentrated in areas that are underserved by physicians and among populations that have difficulty accessing physician-provided care. Our results demonstrate that extending independent prescriptive authority to NPs can help mitigate physician shortages and extend care to disadvantaged populations.","Limited access to mental health care services in the United States is a major public health concern. While one in five Americans suffers from a mental illness—including generalized anxiety and major depressive disorders—nearly one third of the U.S. population lives in areas that are underserved by mental health care providers (Bureau of Health Workforce, 2016).==== As mental disorders tend to develop early in life and persist over the lifecycle (Merikangas et al., 2010), the costs of not receiving treatment can be substantial. In addition to direct medical costs, untreated mental illness is associated with lower human capital accumulation, worse labor market participation and performance, and greater criminal activity (see, for example, Currie and Stabile, 2006; Ettner et al., 1997; Greenberg and Rosenheck, 2008; Kessler et al., 2008). Recent evidence demonstrates that increases in all-cause mortality among non-Hispanic whites are being driven by “deaths of despair” (deaths from suicides, drug and alcohol poisonings, and alcoholic liver disease and cirrhosis; Case and Deaton, 2015, Case and Deaton, 2017), adding energy and urgency to the search for policies that can be used to improve population mental health.====In this paper, we examine whether allowing nurse practitioners (NPs)—a class of registered nurses with advanced degrees in nursing—to prescribe medication without physician supervision or collaboration leads to improvements in population mental health. Leveraging a novel dataset that documents legislative changes granting NPs independent prescriptive authority over 25 years, we find that states that broaden prescriptive authority experience improvements in self-reported mental health and reductions in mental health–related mortality. These improvements are concentrated among disadvantaged populations, suggesting that extending independent prescriptive authority to NPs is an important policy tool that can be used to improve the mental health of populations with limited access to care.====Despite a burgeoning literature demonstrating that NPs can safely and efficiently provide a variety of services, including an endorsement of the skills of NPs by the Institute of Medicine (Institute of Medicine, 2011), efforts to extend prescriptive authority beyond physicians are controversial. Opponents worry that allowing NPs to prescribe medication independently will put patients in danger because NPs receive fewer years of training, are held to different legal standards, and go through a different process of licensing than physicians.==== Critics further note that extending prescriptive authority beyond physicians need not expand overall use of pharmacological treatment, as the prescriptions written by non-physician providers may simply crowd out the prescriptions previously written by physicians. The American Medical Association (AMA), a national professional organization representing physicians and medical students in the Unites States, has been particularly vocal in opposing the expansion of state-level scope of practice legislation for NPs (American Medical Association, 2010).====To measure the impact of extending independent prescriptive authority to NPs on population mental health, we exploit time-series variation in state-level scope of practice legislation and mental health outcomes from 1990 to 2014 using a difference-in-difference framework. We use two complementary categories of health outcomes: (1) self-reported mental health at the individual-year level from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and (2) mental health–related mortality at the county-quarter level from the U.S. Mortality Files.==== Our results demonstrate that extending independent prescriptive authority to NPs leads to significant reductions in the number of days spent in poor mental health (0.17 days per month, or 5% of the mean). We further find a negative relationship between independent prescriptive authority and mental health–related mortality, although the effect is imprecisely estimated.====Notably, improvements in mental health outcomes resulting from independent prescriptive authority for NPs are larger and more precisely estimated in areas that are underserved by physicians and among disadvantaged populations. In particular, areas that are underserved by psychiatrists see statistically significant improvements in self-reported mental health and mental health–related mortality that are at least twice as large as those experienced on average: respondents in underserved states see a reduction of 0.29 days per month in poor mental health (9% of the mean), and underserved counties see a reduction of nearly six mental health–related deaths per quarter (11% of the mean). Individuals with a high school degree or less also see strong improvements in both measures of mental health, with the largest benefits in percentage terms accruing to individuals with low levels of education residing in underserved areas.====Allowing NPs to prescribe independently should disproportionately affect disadvantaged populations for two reasons. First, because psychiatrists and other physicians are more likely to locate in urban and suburban areas, populations in rural areas have the most limited access to psychotropic treatment (Hartley et al., 2004). Second, psychiatrists are less likely than all other physician specialties to accept insurance, with acceptance rates being lowest for Medicaid beneficiaries (Bishop et al., 2014). Therefore, even in areas with a sufficient number of physicians, access to psychotropic medications may still be limited for certain populations. Because NPs are more likely than physicians to locate in rural and inner-city locations and to accept public insurance (Buerhaus et al., 2015, Everett et al., 2009, Grumbach et al., 2003, Larson et al., 2003), granting independent prescriptive authority to NPs has the potential to address physician shortages and extend care to disadvantaged populations.====Finally, using detailed prescription data from 2006 to 2014, we find evidence that extending independent prescriptive authority to NPs increases the use of psychotropic medications among disadvantaged populations. Similar to our findings for mental health–related mortality and self-reported mental health, these effects are concentrated in areas that are underserved for mental health care resources. We find the largest increases in antidepressant and antipsychotic use among Medicaid beneficiaries—a low-income population that we expect to be particularly affected by scope of practice legislation for NPs. Despite having a much shorter time frame, which greatly limits our statistical power over our analyses of mental health outcomes, we nonetheless find evidence that the use of psychotropic medications among disadvantaged populations increases when more providers can prescribe independently.====In light of rising abuse of prescription pain medication (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2014), one concern with broadening prescriptive authority is that such legislation could lead to a greater number of opioid analgesics available for misuse. Again using prescription data from 2006 to 2014, we find that allowing NPs to prescribe independently leads to general increases in opioid prescriptions. While there is a strong, positive relationship between opioid prescriptions per capita and deaths involving drugs within locations over time (Schnell and Currie, 2018), we nevertheless find that allowing NPs to prescribe independently leads to fewer mental health–related deaths, a figure that includes overdoses. Therefore, if anything, our main results underestimate the effects of only extending independent prescriptive authority for non-controlled substances such as antidepressants and antipsychotics.====Our work contributes to a growing literature in economics that empirically examines the implications of occupational licensing, most of which measures the effects of such legislation on wages, employment, and prices across related occupations and services.==== ==== We depart from this literature by focusing on outcomes of the production process—self-reported mental health and mental health–related mortality—rather than the organization and division of resources across actors in the production process itself.====The two most closely related studies to our work are Stange (2014) and Traczynski and Udalova (2018). Stange (2014) finds that allowing NPs to prescribe controlled substances with or without physician supervision only leads to modest increases in healthcare utilization, whereas Traczynski and Udalova (2018) find that allowing NPs to both practice and prescribe independently leads to increases in utilization of primary care services. Our paper departs from this previous literature in four important dimensions. First, given well-documented shortages in access to mental health care services in the United States, we focus on the impact of broadening scope of practice legislation on the use of psychotropic medications and mental health outcomes.==== Second, we use a time horizon of 25 years, which allows us to consider the effects of a larger number of law changes than previous papers. Third, we use larger and more representative datasets than previous work; combined with the long time horizon, this gives us the power to look for heterogenous effects of broadened scope of practice legislation.==== We find that extending independent prescriptive authority to NPs has larger effects among disadvantaged populations, making it a particularly attractive policy instrument for reducing inequality. Finally, given our unique prescription data, we are able to document a “first stage” that helps us understand the mechanisms through which broadened scope of practice legislation affects population mental health.====More broadly, our work contributes to the literature that examines how mental health is affected by policy interventions. Previous studies have focused primarily on policy efforts to improve access to physician-provided care—by increasing access to health insurance, mandating parity in reimbursement for mental health care services, or altering incentives for graduating physicians to enter either psychiatry or primary care—and find mixed results (see, for example, Cunningham, 2009, Finkelstein et al., 2012, Rabinowitz et al., 2008). In contrast to this line of work, we focus on a policy that can increase the accessibility of medical care for disadvantaged populations immediately and at a low cost: there are currently over 234,000 NPs already licensed in the United States who could prescribe independently if legislation permitted them to do so (American Association of Nurse Practitioners, 2017).====Taken together, our results demonstrate that relaxing occupational licensing for non-physician providers can help mitigate the negative consequences of limited access to physician-provided health care. In particular, states that are underserved by physicians can grant independent prescriptive authority to NPs to improve the mental health of their residents. The potential for such legislative action remains large: as of January 2015, only 24 states and the District of Columbia had granted independent prescriptive authority to NPs. Noticeably, no state in the South has yet to allow NPs to independently prescribe.====This paper proceeds as follows. We begin by providing additional background on NPs and scope of practice legislation in Section 2. We then introduce our data in Section 3. In Section 4, we examine how mental health–related mortality and self-reported mental health respond when independent prescriptive authority is extended to NPs. In Section 5, we examine how the number of prescriptions for antidepressants, antipsychotics, and opioids changes when NPs can prescribe independently.

The pictorial warnings were accompanied by a reference to a ==== helpline and supportive television commercials. Applying an ==== control measure to reduce the social costs of smoking.","Tobacco smoking remains one of the main preventable causes of disease and mortality worldwide (Samet, 2013). Despite the well-documented detrimental health effects of smoking, the World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that, even in 2017, around 20% of individuals aged 15 and above smoke regularly and that 5 million deaths worldwide are attributable to smoking each year (WHO, 2017). Aside from preventable deaths, the total costs of smoking on society include both the direct costs (e.g., smoking related health care expenditures) and indirect costs (e.g., including productivity losses from morbidity attributable to smoking). Goodchild et al. (2018) estimate that the direct and indirect costs of smoking amount to $US 1.4 trillion in 2012, corresponding to 5.7% of global health care expenditure and 1.8% of the world's gross domestic product. Moreover, tobacco usage not only harms smokers directly, but also imposes large negative fiscal and health externalities on non-smokers: for the case of second-hand smoking, Öberg et al. (2011) estimate that around 600,000 individuals die each year from the exposure to second-hand smoke.====To reduce these substantial costs to society, most countries have implemented different tobacco control policies to help individuals quit smoking and to prevent individuals from starting to smoke. These policies include the regulation of cigarette prices, advertising of tobacco products, legal minimum vending age, smoking bans, and warning labels on tobacco products (for an overview, see, e.g., De Beyer and Brigden, 2003). While text-only warnings on tobacco products were introduced in the mid-1960s, Canada was the first country to legally require full-colour pictorial warnings on tobacco products in 2001 (Hiilamo et al., 2014). Since then, many countries have followed and, in 2016, pictorial warnings had been implemented in 105 countries covering 58% of the world's population (Canadian Cancer Society, 2016).====The rationale behind pictorial warnings on tobacco products is to inform smokers and non-smokers about the documented health risks of smoking and to achieve behavioural changes through the shock-value of loss-framed graphical images (e.g., Hammond, 2011). Seen through the lens of economic theory, the shock-value of the images and the additional health information are intended to lower the marginal utility of consumption and to act as an implicit increase in the price of current and future cigarettes through the provision of more information about the health care costs of tobacco consumption. Both the rational addiction model (Becker and Murphy, 1988) and behavioural models of irrational addiction (e.g., Gruber and Köszegi, 2001) predict that lower marginal utilities of consumption and future price increases will lead some smokers to quit smoking altogether and other smokers to decrease their current cigarette consumption. Thus, we would expect the policy to reduce smoking rates immediately and on a permanent level. However, the physical and psychological processes through which health information campaigns can permanently affect health behaviour is extremely complex. Thus, it is not surprising that the previous literature examining the effectiveness of health education has produced ambiguous results (see, e.g.,Glanz et al., 2008, Tones et al., 2013).====While numerous studies have examined the short-term effectiveness of pictorial warnings on individuals’ ability to recall the content of the warning messages, their attitudes and beliefs towards smoking, and their intentions to smoke (see Section 2.1), surprisingly few studies have examined the effects on actual smoking behaviour. In a comprehensive literature review, Monárrez-Espino et al. (2014, p. 30) are fairly critical of the quality of existing studies: “studies assessing the effect of pictorial warnings on cigarette packages on cessation, reduction, and attempt to quit smoking have been very limited in amount and quality and therefore have provided no clear evidence regarding the question of effectiveness of pictorial warning on smoking behavior”. While most observational studies find decreases in smoking prevalence and reductions in the number of cigarettes smoked, many of these studies cannot isolate the effect of the policy due to the simultaneous introduction of other tobacco control policies such as changes in cigarette taxes and/or smoking bans, and by failing to account for the general downward trends in smoking over the past few decades (see reviews by Noar et al., 2016a, Noar et al., 2016b). Thus, the evidence on the effectiveness of pictorial warnings on smoking behaviour is still inconclusive. This lack of rigorous empirical evidence is probably best reflected by the current legal battle in the US between the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which intended to implement graphic warnings in the US in 2011, and the tobacco industry that keeps challenging the empirical evidence for the effectiveness of pictorial warnings in court (NYT, 2016).====The purpose of this paper is to provide new evidence on the impact of pictorial warnings on tobacco products on smoking behaviour. It is important to recognise that the reform we analyse combines three elements: First, the major change relates to the introduction of pictorial warnings on the front and back of tobacco products’ packages. Second, the reform required tobacco manufacturers to move the previously existing reference to the Australian Quitline number, which provides smoking cessation advice, from the side to the back of packages. Third, a series of mass media campaigns were initiated by the central government, several Australian states, and territory-based non-government health agencies to support and reinforce the messages of the new pictorial warnings. As we are not able to disentangle the relative contribution of each of these policies to the overall effect, the effect we estimate hence combines these three elements.====Our study makes the following contributions to the literature. ====, in a new attempt to transparently estimate the impact of pictorial warnings on smoking outcomes, we examine the reform within an event study approach. Previous studies typically compare mean differences before and after the introduction of similar policies without accounting for secular time trends (see Monárrez-Espino et al., 2014, Noar et al., 2016a, Noar et al., 2016b). This approach, however, is likely to overestimate the true effect given declining trends in smoking rates. The advantage of our approach is that we use data from 2002 to 2010 which allows us to control for secular trends in smoking prevalence prior to the reform to identify the short-run impact of the policy. Compared to previous studies, a further advantage of our setting is that most tobacco control policies, including changes in cigarette taxes, the supply of cigarettes, advertising, or the legal minimum vending age, were not changed simultaneously with the reform. So far, no study has examined the effect of the Australian reform on smoking prevalence at the national level.====, many previous studies have relied on small samples where the sample size ranges from less than 100 observations to around 2000 observations per cohort and wave (Monárrez-Espino et al., 2014). We use nationally representative data from the Australian HILDA (Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia) survey to avoid the issues of small and potentially selective samples: our estimation sample consists of 18,863 individuals resulting in 103,007 person-year observations. Moreover, we use longitudinal data which allow us to explore the previously neglected dynamics of individuals’ smoking behaviour (Noar et al., 2016a), in particular whether individuals change their smoking status due to the policy. Whereas the previous literature has largely focused on intentions to quit (see Section 2.1), the HILDA data allow us to examine actual smoking behaviour, including quitting and initiating/relapsing between waves.====, the large sample size allows us to provide novel evidence on effect heterogeneities, paying particular attention to differences by age groups, gender, and socio-economics status. The previous literature suggests that younger individuals may be more susceptible to the new pictorial health warnings (e.g., Elton-Marshall et al., 2018) and that lower-educated individuals may react more strongly since they typically have less knowledge about the negative health effects of smoking and may find the pictorial warnings easier to process compared to text-only warnings (e.g., Durkin et al., 2009, Cantrell et al., 2013). While such heterogeneous responses have been documented for smoking bans (e.g., Kuehnle and Wunder, 2017) and may have potentially large consequences for socio-economic health disparities, the previous literature on pictorial warnings has largely neglected such heterogeneities.====We find that the introduction of pictorial warnings on tobacco products in Australia was associated with a significant decrease in smoking prevalence of about 0.9 percentage points (4%) on average, and for individuals aged 15 to 29 in particular (−9.3%). The smoking behaviour of individuals aged 50 and over was not affected by the policy. The effect materialises within the first year of the policy and permanently lowered smoking rates. Exploring potential mechanisms, we show that the policy significantly increased the probability to quit smoking only in the year of the reform. The effects are slightly stronger for low-educated compared to high-educated individuals. The results are robust to numerous sensitivity checks, such as controlling for cigarette prices, varying the observation window around the reform date, controlling for individual fixed-effects, and using a placebo reform that takes place one year earlier. Overall, we conclude that pictorial warnings on cigarette packages, supported by targeted commercials and a direct reference to a smoking cessation helpline, are an effective means to reduce smoking rates.====The paper proceeds as follows. First, Section 2 provides a brief review of the relevant literature and the institutional details of the reform. Section 3 introduces the methodological framework and discusses the empirical challenges. Section 4 describes the data and variables used in the analysis. Section 5 discusses the results and shows their robustness. We conclude our paper in Section 6.",How effective are pictorial warnings on tobacco products?

Identification is achieved by using the exposure of children to the compulsory education law in China and its interaction with local schooling level before law enforcement as instruments for children's years of schooling. IV estimation results demonstrate that increasing years of education of children lead to better cognitive functions, higher survival expectations and improved lung function of Chinese older parents. Further evidence suggests that children's education might shape health of older parents by providing financial support, affecting the access to resources and influencing the labor supply and psychological well-being of parents.","Social science literature has consistently found positive relationships between education and health (Baker et al., 2011). Education has been shown to be one of the most important predictors of individual health (Cutler and Lleras-Muney, 2008), and it is also among the strongest correlates of the health of offspring (Grossman, 2006). Though most of the evidence for the benefit of education on health has focused on own education and the transmission of human capital from older to younger generations, more recent work points to the potential influence of other family members, spouses and children in particular, on health of adults (Brown et al., 2014; De Neve and Harling, 2017). In the network approach to understand health differentials proposed by Berkman et al. (2000) and theory on social capital and health (Song and Lin, 2009), the characteristics of one's social network might influence health-related behaviors, support and resources individual receive as well as psychological factors that shape health status (e.g., Torssander, 2013, Friedman and Mare, 2014, Lee, 2017). These network views thus give rise to the question which is surprisingly less discussed in the literature: Does children's education also matter for parents’ health, especially when the parents are older and more dependent on familial support? A few recent studies have tested such hypotheses and found that children's education level is positively correlated with older adults’ physical function (Zimmer et al., 2002, Yahirun et al., 2016, Yahirun et al., 2017), biological functioning (Lee, 2017), mental health (Lee et al., 2017), cognition (Lee, 2018) and survival (Zimmer et al., 2007; Torssander, 2013; Friedman and Mare, 2014; Yang et al., 2016; De Neve and Harling, 2017; Yahirun et al., 2017; De Neve and Fink, 2018).====Though research in this area is growing rapidly, most of the aforementioned results are correlational evidence. Bias arises from the reverse causality problem that healthier parents are better able to invest in children's schooling, and the omitted variable problem that unobserved genetic and/or environmental factors could lead to concordant levels of human capital of both parents and children. The use of sibling fixed effects models as in Torssander (2013) can only partially control for the latter, leaving the former unaddressed. Lundborg and Majlesi (2018) and De Neve and Fink (2018) are the only exceptions that estimate the causal impact of children's educational attainment on parents’ longevity by using exposure to education reforms as instruments for years of schooling of children. While Lundborg and Majlesi (2018) failed to find any significant causal effect of children's education on survival of parents in Sweden on average, their results imply that the schooling of daughters affects the survival of fathers positively, especially those from low socio-economic background. De Neve and Fink (2018), on the other hand, using census data from Tanzania, found positive impacts of schooling of children on parental survival for both genders. Given the mixed findings from the causal studies, whether the spillover from children's education on parental health are generalizable in different contexts remains an open question and the underlying pathways linking the two are less clear.====This paper adds to the small literature on the effect of children's education on older parents’ health by providing causal evidence from China, where such effect is especially important. The Chinese system of extended families, which is traditionally organized as a corporate unit by pooling economic resources and providing assistance to all family members (Zimmer et al., 2002), remains as the major form of old-age security for Chinese elderly. With the inadequate pension system in China (Cai et al., 2012), private transfers are therefore crucial for reducing old-age poverty of Chinese elderly households especially in rural areas (Zhao et al., 2013b). Furthermore, China is undergoing rapid population aging. Given the decrease of family size and the migration process in China, the duty of old-age support has been placed on a smaller network of children. Consequently, the socioeconomic status of children might play an increasingly important role in the later life of Chinese elderly parents.====To study the spillover effect of children's education on health of older adults in China, I employ an IV/2SLS approach to data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, by exploiting as natural experiments the gradual roll-out of the ==== from 1985 to 1991 across 28 Chinese provinces. The law enforcement timing and the heterogeneous program effectiveness generate exogenous variation in years of schooling of children both across birth provinces and cohorts. It extends the causal analyses of De Neve and Fink (2018) and Lundborg and Majlesi (2018) to a different population, and the correlation studies of Lee (2017), Yang et al. (2016), Zimmer et al. (2002) and Zimmer et al. (2007) who have studied Chinese elderly.====This study builds on the existing research by analyzing multiple health variables that underlie health deterioration in later life. Most of the previous work focus on mortality or the disablement process (e.g., Zimmer et al., 2007; Friedman and Mare, 2014; Yahirun et al., 2017; Lundborg and Majlesi, 2018). Understanding the effect of children's education on the full spectrum of health therefore requires studying health as a multidimensional concept and evidence on various health outcomes that are precursors of these at the low end. This paper studies both subjective and objective health measures, covering physical, mental and cognitive health outcomes, which are key to the quality of life of Chinese older adults. IV estimation results of this paper show that more years of education of children lead to increase in a wide array of health and cognition outcomes of Chinese older parents, including episodic memory, mental intactness, subjective survival expectation and lung function. These health indicators have been shown by past research as predictive or associated with physical function (e.g., Seeman et al., 1994, Cook et al., 1995), functional limitation and disability (e.g., Moritz et al., 1995, Vaz Fragoso et al., 2008), and mortality (e.g., Cook et al., 1991, Idler and Benyamini, 1997, Smits et al., 1999, Smits et al., 1999, Hurd and McGarry, 2002, Gale et al., 2006).====This paper also expands upon the work of Friedman and Mare (2014), Yahirun et al. (2017), Lee (2018), Lundborg and Majlesi (2018) and De Neve and Fink (2018), who shed light on the pathways through which children's education influences health of parents, by explicitly examining the effects of increase in children's education on social support, access to resources, health behaviors and other proximate pathways including psychological well-being and labor supply. I find evidence for improved social support that parents received in the form of net financial transfer from children, and increased parental access to general economic resource (measured by household expenditure), clean fuels (gas and electricity as opposed to solid fuel) and improved sanitation (private in-house toilets). Parents with better educated children are more satisfied with their lives and less likely to work in old age, implying that psychological well-being and leisure/labor supply of parents might also play a role in explaining the health effect of education of children.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines the possible channels through which the health of older adults may be linked to the education of their children. Section 3 introduces the compulsory education reform of China. Section 4 describes the data and variables. Section 5 presents the empirical strategy. Section 6 reports estimation results for health of older adults and the underlying pathways.

The well-known argument that parallel trade dampens innovation by undermining firms’ ability to price discriminate has been challenged by recent literature. The argument is that with endogenous price controls, parallel trade increases innovation by reducing governments’ incentives to set particularly low price caps. In this paper, we show that this result crucially depends on the degree of homogeneity of the trading countries. The result only holds if consumers in poorer countries have a relatively similar demand for medication as consumers in richer countries. Instead, when countries are relatively heterogeneous, parallel trade dampens innovation and lowers welfare by exporting price cap regulation from poorer to richer countries. These findings are in line with recent case evidence. We also show that when ==== length is endogenous, richer countries will tend to choose longer patent protection with parallel trade, whereas equilibrium price caps tend to be tighter in that case.","Parallel trade is the process of international arbitrage when producers price discriminate between different countries. In many industries, particularly research-intensive industries such as pharmaceuticals, wholesalers purchase products in lower-priced countries and reimport them into higher-priced countries to benefit from international price differentials. For example, in an important case, ====, Glaxo Group sold several drugs, including critical HIV treatments, at reduced prices to buyers in Africa.==== Rather than distributing the pharmaceuticals to African patients (as originally intended by Glaxo), the purchasers sold them on to the parallel trader Dowelhurst, which reimported them into the United Kingdom.====Whether or not such parallel trade is permitted to take place in practice largely depends on the statutory provisions in the affected countries. For instance, in the European Union parallel trade between member states is generally legal (so-called “international exhaustion” of property rights), whereas parallel imports from non-member states can be restricted by manufacturers (so-called “national exhaustion” of property rights).====Much of the policy debate on parallel imports has focused on their impact on firms’ incentives to engage in R&D.==== Pharmaceutical companies, in particular, have often argued that international exhaustion undermines innovation.==== The primary intuition for this argument is that price discrimination of patented products enables producers to extract larger rents ex-post, thereby increasing ex-ante incentives to invest in R&D. This line of reasoning has found significant support in the economic literature. For example, Valletti and Szymanski (2006) show that parallel trade tends to reduce incentives to engage in demand-enhancing R&D by reducing ex-post returns. Similarly, Li and Maskus (2006) find that cost-reducing investments tend to be dampened by parallel trade.====This argument is based on the assumption that firms can freely set the prices of their drugs in different countries. In reality, however, prices of pharmaceuticals are often constrained by government regulation, particularly in poorer countries (i.e., countries with a low income). Nevertheless, as shown by Rey (2003), parallel trade tends to reduce firms’ incentives to invest in R&D also if one accounts for the possibility of price regulation. The reason is that parallel trade exports price caps from poorer countries into richer countries. This lowers revenues of pharmaceutical companies and reduces their investment incentives.====In a highly influential article, Grossman and Lai (2008) challenge these positions. Their paper extends over prior approaches by permitting price caps to be endogenously determined by governments to maximize domestic welfare. They conclude that once one properly accounts for the endogeneity of price caps, parallel trade tends to increase innovation and welfare. The reason is that governments correctly anticipate that imposing low prices on domestic sales of pharmaceuticals can be self-defeating when parallel trade is permitted. First, since domestic price reductions will be exported into other countries, such price cutting leads to significantly lower innovation incentives than would be the case without parallel trade. Second, if a poorer country imposes a strict price cap, innovating firms may not be willing to serve that country when parallel trade is permitted (to prevent cheap exports to richer countries). As a result, parallel trade disciplines countries’ incentive to free ride through low price regulations and therefore increases innovation incentives and welfare.====In this paper, we consider a simplified version of Grossman and Lai's (2008) framework, but allow for an additional heterogeneity between the countries. Concretely, we allow the consumers’ marginal utility from consumption of the product to differ in the two trading countries, which leads to different demands in the countries.==== Indeed, while Grossman and Lai (2008) consider differences in income between countries, they assume that consumers’ marginal utilities for the product in question are identical across countries. Real-world parallel trade in pharmaceuticals, however, is often triggered precisely because countries differ in their demand for on-patent drugs.====We show that the extent of heterogeneity in demands turns out to be a crucial determinant of whether parallel trade improves or lowers innovation incentives and social welfare. When demands are relatively similar in the two countries, parallel trade stimulates innovation and improves welfare, which confirms the result obtained by Grossman and Lai (2008). We also show, however, that this conclusion reverses if demands between the two countries are relatively heterogeneous. In that case, parallel trade lowers innovation incentives and decreases social welfare despite the fact that price cap regulation is endogenously determined by government choice.====The intuition behind this result is as follows. First, if the demand in one country is substantially lower than in the other, the former country faces the problem that it cannot set a sufficiently high price cap to induce the producer to supply the drug in its market. Since its lower price would effectively be exported into the richer country when parallel trade is permitted, it is profitable for the producer to forgo serving the poorer country. By contrast, in the absence of parallel trade, the price that can be charged in the richer country is unaffected by the regulatory policy in the poorer country. The producer therefore has no incentive to restrict supply in the poorer country despite being forced to lower prices by regulation. Because the resulting additional sales in the poorer country are profitable for the producer, a restriction of parallel trade not only improves drug access but also fosters innovation incentives in this case. Second, when demand in the poorer country is in an intermediate range, its government sets the price cap at a level that is just sufficient to ensure availability of the drug in its country. As the price cap is exported into the richer country when parallel trade is permitted, innovation incentives are again lower than they would be in the absence of parallel trade. This negative effect is only partially taken into account by the government of the poorer country, however, because the richer country also bears part of the welfare loss. In equilibrium, the negative effect of reduced innovation dominates the countervailing positive effect of larger sales resulting from lower prices. Thus, also in the case of intermediate demand in the poorer country, parallel trade tends to reduce innovation and welfare.====In summary, we therefore obtain that allowing parallel trade is likely to be socially beneficial when applied to countries with a relatively similar marginal utility for pharmaceutical innovations (e.g., countries with similar levels of economic development). However, when countries materially differ with regard to their marginal utility for pharmaceutical innovations (e.g., countries with fairly different levels of economic development), parallel trade is likely to be socially harmful. Although these results are similar to those obtained in standard analyses of parallel import, our paper puts these results on much more solid ground because it explicitly considers endogenous R&D investments and endogenous price caps. Our analysis therefore goes beyond previous studies by determining several novel effects explaining these results.====Our results also find evidence in recent cases of regulation on parallel trade. For example, in September 2018, the Turkish competition authority in a case between the drug producer Roche and the pharmaceutical wholesales Corena ruled that export bans imposed by Roche on its drugs are lawful (Unlu and Beyazo, 2019). This effectively amounts to recognizing national exhaustion of intellectual property rights for drugs in Turkey. As most pharmaceutical prices in Turkey are under strict governmental regulation, they are very low relative to other countries, rendering parallel trade by wholesalers attractive.==== The decision prevents this activity, explicitly reasoning that allowing for parallel exports implies the risk of shortages in the Turkish market and has a negative impact on innovation.====Another example is the practice of several national authorities to develop mechanisms shielding prices faced by the public health system from the impact of parallel trade. For instance, in Spain, since 2000, only the prices of drugs purchased by the public health system are regulated, allowing manufacturers to charge higher prices for drugs that are not consumed through the public health system and may be exported.==== Another piece of evidence for our results can be observed in the regulation system of retail prices for patented drugs in Mexico. As pointed out by Moïse and Docteur (2007), the maximum retail prices are relatively high, especially given the low GDP per capita and low prices in Mexico generally. As Mexico follows the principle of international exhaustion, this high-price regulation may reflect the threat of parallel trade with the United States (i.e., if regulated prices were low, producers would not be willing to sell their drugs in Mexico due to the risk of parallel exports).====We also extend our analysis by allowing for endogenous patent length. If the innovating firm is located in the richer country (as is standard in the literature because this has historically been the case for most R&D-intensive pharmaceutical companies), the government of the richer country will take firm profits (partially) into account when setting the patent length. By contrast, the government in the poorer country only cares about local consumer welfare. We obtain that the main insights of the baseline model carry over to the case of endogenous patent duration. In addition, we find that the patent length preferred by the government of the richer country tends to be longer when parallel trade is allowed. The main reason for this is that patent length and price regulation by the poorer country are strategic substitutes. In other words, the poorer country responds to increased patent length by imposing stricter domestic price controls (i.e., lower prices). However, this countervailing response is less pronounced when parallel trade is permitted, as the dampening effect of price caps on innovation is more severe in this case. As a result, the government of the richer country has a preference for longer patent length with parallel trade than without it.====The early economic literature on parallel trade has focused on the static welfare effects of geographic price discrimination. In a pioneering article, Malueg and Schwartz (1994) show that parallel trade increases welfare if trading countries are relatively homogeneous, but lowers welfare in case of heterogeneous countries. The reason for this is that, while parallel trade avoids a misallocation of goods, with significant heterogeneity between countries, many of them are not served.==== Ganslandt and Maskus (2004) empirically test whether parallel imports led to an increase or decrease in the prices of pharmaceuticals in Sweden and find a significant fall.==== More recently, Raff and Schmitt (2007) and Maskus and Stähler (2014) analyze in more detail the relationship between manufacturers and the distributors reimporting the product. In particular, they consider the maintenance of inventories in the face of uncertain demand and the impact of private information with respect to unknown quality. They find that the price effect of parallel trade is ambiguous. This strand of the literature is not concerned with innovation incentives, however.====Li and Maskus (2006), on the other hand, take a dynamic perspective and consider the effects of parallel trade on innovation incentives. They show that parallel trade inhibits innovation as it does not allow manufacturers to price discriminate and thereby decreases returns on investment.==== Valletti (2006) nuances this finding by showing that parallel trade only harms investments when price discrimination is based on differences in demand rather than on differences in the costs of serving different markets. Moreover, Matteucci and Reverberi (2014) demonstrate that parallel trade can sometimes increase investment incentives due to competition from distributors. However, this literature does not consider the existence of price caps, which are a central feature of parallel trade in the pharmaceutical industry.====As explained above, our paper builds on Grossman and Lai (2008) by allowing both for endogenous price controls in the poorer country and endogenous innovation choice by the drug producer. Our main departure from Grossman and Lai (2008) is that we allow the trading countries to have different demands for the product in question and show that this is crucial for the equilibrium allocation and welfare implications of parallel trade. Bennato and Valletti (2014) show that Grossman and Lai's (2008) welfare results may not hold when countries cannot commit to a price cap, which leads to the possibility of a hold-up problem. In contrast to our paper, they also assume that countries do not differ in the demands for the drug.====On the empirical side, Duso et al. (2014) find that in the German market for oral anti-diabetics, parallel trade reduces the profit of the original drug manufacturer by 37% per year. Similarly, Brekke et al. (2015), using data from the Norwegian pharmaceutical market for 165 substances, show that parallel trade leads to a less stringent price cap regulation. Both findings are consistent with our results.====The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 sets out the model. Section 3 derives the equilibrium under national exhaustion of property rights (i.e., in the absence of parallel trade). Section 4 presents the equilibrium under international exhaustion (i.e., in the presence of parallel trade). Section 5 compares the two regimes with respect to innovation incentives and welfare. Section 6 analyzes endogenous patent lengths in the two regimes. Finally, Section 7 discusses policy implications and concludes.","Parallel imports, price controls, and innovation",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629618307768,12 June 2019,2019,Research Article,298.0

To implement a payment system, the regulator selects a methodology to establish prices for each of the thousands of procedures physicians perform, the hundreds of disease groups treated by hospitals, or per capita prices paid to plans for the nearly innumerable combinations of enrollees’ health conditions. In many health care settings, prices are set according to observed costs in the market. In the U.S. Medicare program, a hospital’s payment for a given inpatient admission is tied to the national average cost of admissions belonging to the same diagnosis-related group (DRG). In the Medicare Advantage program, the Affordable Care Act Marketplaces, most state Medicaid programs, and in Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and other countries, a health plan’s payment for enrolling a given individual is tied to the average cost of individuals with similar demographics and histories of chronic conditions. This method for setting prices weakens incentives for inefficient “cream-skimming” behaviors by insurers (Geruso et al., 2016; Newhouse et al., 2015).====While acknowledging the benefits of setting prices in this way, this paper explores a previously unresolved deficiency: when the existing health care system is inefficient or unfair, setting payments based on observed costs may sustain those inefficiencies or inequities, which may be precisely the issues the payment system is meant to correct. Consider the following extreme example: suppose under the current health plan payment system individuals with cancer are highly unprofitable due to low revenues relative to costs, and insurers rationally respond by limiting access to care for individuals with cancer to deter those individuals from enrolling in their plans. Further, assume insurers are so effective at rationing access that individuals with cancer obtain only very low levels of spending, for example, $1000. Now suppose a regulator seeks to address the problem of insurers inefficiently limiting access to care for individuals with cancer by “risk adjusting” payments to health plans, and they use a standard risk adjustment system where plan payments are adjusted according to the observed $1000 of spending for individuals with cancer. Such a payment system will not solve the problem the regulator sought to fix, because individuals with cancer will appear relatively inexpensive due to the insurers’ actions limiting their access to care. Thus, this conventional approach to payment will sustain rather than correct the insurers’ incentive to inefficiently limit access to care for this group. While this example is extreme, a weaker version of this feedback loop between inefficiencies embedded in the health care system and the incentives embedded in the payments is likely to play out in many more realistic settings.==== The general point is that if regulated prices are intended to move the health care system to be more efficient and fair, using observed (inefficient/unfair) patterns of care for payment calibration will not fix the existing flaws.====The problem of basing risk adjusted payments on observed costs has been previously acknowledged (van de Ven and Ellis, 2000; Zweiful et al., 2009), but using data other than observed costs has been dismissed as being difficult to put into practice, and instead observed costs are often assumed to represent “acceptable” cost levels. Both Schokkaert and van de Voorde (2004) and Stam et al. (2010) propose methods for risk adjustment improvement that incorporate information on normative costs by leveraging risk factors that are desirable to subsidize and those that are not (e.g., inefficient practice styles or higher rates of smoking in some subpopulations). However, these approaches maintain the basic practice of correcting inefficient risk adjustment payments by modifying the risk factors included in the algorithm, rather than through transformations to the underlying data used to estimate the payments tied to those risk factors.====In this paper, we show that data modified to reflect the researcher’s or policymaker’s beliefs about ==== and ==== levels of spending versus the ==== spending levels can be used for calibrating health plan payments. We propose a systematic approach for transforming data in a pre-estimation step to break the feedback loop between plan payments and insurer actions. The intuition behind our proposed method follows from conditions of market equilibrium: set prices to buy the equilibrium you want, not the equilibrium you currently have. After introducing background material in Section 2, we lay out the theoretical basis of our approach in Section 3. The model in Section 3 characterizes the optimal input data (which leads to the desired health care system outcomes) at an abstract level, and then translates the ideas for our empirical applications of health plan payment in Medicare. In Section 4, we describe two data transformation examples. The first focuses on underpayment for individuals with chronic illnesses, and the second addresses disparities in health care spending by zip code-level income. We empirically compare our method to approaches based on modifying payment algorithms using existing data. This includes exploring the conventional approach of adding or removing risk adjustor variables from the pricing algorithm. In the chronic diseases example, we include additional risk adjustors for chronic illness groups, and in the disparities example we include a low-income neighborhood indicator. We also leave the set of risk adjustors in place but introduce constraints on the OLS regression that target spending for groups of interest (van Kleef et al., 2017).====Both applications demonstrate that data transformation is a powerful approach for moving plan payments closer to the desired levels. In the chronic diseases application, data transformation is the most effective method for improving fit across all groups. Introducing constraints on the risk adjustment formula also performs well at the group level, while adding risk adjustors to the OLS regression is the least effective approach. The substantial improvements in group-level fit for both our method and constrained regression come at only a trivial decrease in statistical fit at the individual level (i.e., R====) compared to an unconstrained OLS regression. In the disparities application, adding a risk adjustor for neighborhood income is highly ineffective if the objective is to address health care spending disparities for that group. Such an action aggravates the disparity by income group. Data transformation improves incentives to serve a group, but combining data transformation with adding a risk adjustor is even more effective at altering incentives because it combines the strengths of both approaches.",Data transformations to improve the performance of health plan payment methods,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016762961830290X,24 May 2019,2019,Research Article,299.0

We found that patients who go to higher-rated SNFs achieved better outcomes, supporting the validity of the SNF report card ratings.","Although quality is an essential determinant of the demand for goods and services, consumers often have incomplete information about quality prior to purchase. As such, in many markets consumers rely on published firm ratings to help choose a particular provider of goods or services. The quality of health care services is especially difficult for consumers to evaluate. Therefore, it can be efficient for the government to overcome this market failure by collecting information about quality and reporting it publicly. In the case of health care, the government publishes report cards online for hospitals, dialysis facilities, nursing homes, and home health agencies. Proponents of public report cards believe that these ratings overcome the asymmetric information problem, allow consumers to make informed decisions about quality of care, force health care providers to compete on quality, and create incentives for providers to improve quality of care.====Critics of public report cards, however, are concerned about several practical problems. Report cards publish ratings based on past measures, which may not predict future outcomes well. In particular, past measures may not predict future quality of care if those measures do not directly measure the aspects of quality that consumers care about, if they are based on small samples, or if they are not adequately risk adjusted. Health care providers may have an incentive to improve quality, but they also have an incentive to cream skim and endogenously select patients who are expected to have better outcomes. Risk adjustment is never perfect.====Given the theoretical arguments both in favor of and against public report cards, what matters is how they work in practice (Werner et al., 2012). Do public report card ratings predict future quality of care? In the case of a Medicare patient seeking a high-quality nursing home following a hospital stay, is that patient better off choosing a skilled nursing facility (SNF) with a higher star rating? Or, does a higher star rating simply reflect a more favorable mix of patients in the past or good performance on measures that are not valued by that patient? This paper addresses those empirical research questions.====As way of background, a large literature documents the prevalence of low-quality SNF care (Grabowski and Norton, 2012). A parallel literature has observed wide geographic variation in Medicare spending on post-acute services such as SNFs (Newhouse and Garber, 2013). In linking these two literatures, the general sentiment is that a great deal of low-value SNF care is delivered (Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, 2016). To discourage low-value care, a number of market-based approaches have been introduced to encourage a market for quality. These approaches include the use of report cards (Konetzka et al., 2015), pay-for-performance (Grabowski et al., 2017; Norton, 1992), and alternative payment models like bundled payment (Sood et al. 2011) and accountable care organizations (McWilliams et al. 2017). If these market-based approaches are going to be successful, the measures of SNF quality of care need to be reliable and valid.====Researchers and stakeholders have expressed concerns over the different SNF quality measures used for public reporting and payment (Mor, 2006). The primary overall quality measure for SNFs is the Nursing Home Compare star rating, which is collected by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and posted publicly on a website. Nursing homes (including SNFs) are rated on a variety of measures. This information is summarized in one overall rating, from one star (worst) to five stars (best). Given that Nursing Home Compare’s overall star rating is intended to provide consumers accurate information about quality of care, it is important to know if a patient’s outcomes will improve if she chooses a higher-rated nursing home.====The greatest empirical challenge to evaluating the star ratings is overcoming the endogeneity of choice of SNF by patients who are not randomly assigned to nursing homes of varying star ratings. Prior studies have measured the correlation between star ratings and outcomes (e.g., Kimball et al., 2018; Ogunneye et al., 2015; Unroe et al., 2012, Ryskina et al., 2018), but they have not addressed the issue of patient selection across high- and low-star facilities. As such, any differences observed in these earlier studies may be an artifact of the different types of patients treated at high- and low-star facilities. Although these studies have often included a broad set of controls, unmeasured factors are likely correlated with both the selection of a high-quality SNF and patient outcomes, which leads to biased estimates.====The contribution of this paper is to address the potential bias introduced by patient case mix by using instrumental variables. This approach exploits variation over time in the distance from the patient’s home address to the closest nursing home of each star rating. We ask, if a patient who needs post-acute care goes to a SNF with a higher star rating, then what effect does that choice have on their mortality, hospital readmission, and length of stay? We condition our main analyses on the patient’s neighborhood. Using ZIP code fixed effects, the model compares patients from the same ZIP codes who are discharged at different times but make different choices about which SNF to enter because star ratings, and the relative distances to SNFs of different star ratings, change over time. Unlike the earlier literature, our approach allows us to estimate the causal effect on outcomes of going to a higher-rated facility. The local average treatment effect for compliers is the effect of choosing a higher-rated SNF because of the changes in proximity between a person’s home and SNFs in each star category.====To preview our results, using data from nearly 1.3 million new SNF Medicare patients in 2012-2013, we find that being admitted to a SNF with one additional star leads to significantly lower mortality, fewer days in the nursing home, fewer hospital readmissions, and more days at home or with home health care during the first six months post SNF admission. These results are robust to different modeling choices, such as the inclusion of SNF or hospital fixed effects; specification of star rating as linear or ordinal; and different ways of measuring outcomes.",Do report cards predict future quality?

This suggests that in the context of Sweden, the social safety net is able to mitigate the effects of early-life health on labor market outcomes during economic downturns.","A large and growing literature in economics studies the individual-level consequences of macroeconomic fluctuations. Given the importance of health human capital for labor market outcomes, one strand of this literature investigates whether and how events like recessions, job displacements and business cycles affect health outcomes.==== A second important strand of research examines who is affected by macroeconomic fluctuations and focuses mostly on heterogeneous impacts by demographic characteristics, such as age, gender, sex, race and education.==== However, despite the large amount of work in this area, only very few studies investigate whether pre-determined health, such as health at birth, dictates the degree to which individuals are affected during recessions. In this paper, we contribute to this literature by showing that pre-crisis health, as measured by birth weight, is an important marker for labor market vulnerability during macroeconomic downturns.====There are at least two reasons why examining how pre-determined health moderates the impacts of crises is important. First, understanding the returns to health is crucial for both individuals and governments, and one understudied aspect of these returns is whether better health makes individuals more resilient to economic shocks. If having better ==== health helps to weather economic fluctuations, then this could be yet another reason for individuals to invest more in their own health human capital. Second, investigating the importance of pre-determined health during recessions provides important insights into the role of social insurance in helping to smooth shocks. While it might not be possible to equalize health across the population, social safety nets could ensure that individuals subjected to worse health for exogenous reasons are able to smooth income during periods of economic crises.====We study the effects of pre-determined health on job loss before and after an unexpected and dramatic increase in unemployment in Sweden in the early 1990s, when unemployment went from 2% to 8% in less than three years. This crisis has been referred to as one of the “Big Five” postwar economic downturns in Reinhart and Rogoff (2008), and many observers of the Great Recession in 2008 have compared it to this Swedish crash.==== While much has been written about the causes and consequences of the crisis in the Nordic countries during the early 1990s (Englund, 1999; Jonung et al., 2009; Gorodnichenko et al., 2012), the main import from these studies appears to be that it was the result of a combination of factors, including monetary policy, budget deficits, financial deregulation, and a collapse of trade. Prior work has shown that the effects of such economic crises differ between the private and the public sector (Kopelman and Rosen, 2016), and the Swedish case was no exception (Lundborg, 2001). We therefore examine the impacts of pre-determined health on labor market outcomes separately for each sector.====In the empirical analysis, we estimate the differential impact of early-life health on job loss after the crisis in the early 1990s as compared to before it. Our two main outcome variables are an indicator for receiving any unemployment insurance (UI) benefits, and the fraction of total income coming from such benefits.==== We measure early-life health using birth weight, which is a widely-used proxy for health at infancy. Recognizing that birth weight captures both nutritional intake and maternal behaviors such as smoking, which might confound our analysis, we follow prior studies (Almond et al., 2005; Black et al., 2007; Royer, 2009; Bharadwaj et al., 2018a, Bharadwaj et al., 2018b) and identify effects using only exogenous variation within twin pairs. Since we compare the impacts of birth weight across two time periods – before and after the crisis – and between two twins, our empirical strategy intuitively resembles a difference-in-differences model.====The results show that adults who were born with better health were significantly less likely to face job loss and go on unemployment insurance during the crisis. This is especially true for individuals working in the private sector, for whom we find that a 10% increase in birth weight differentially reduces receipt of UI benefits by 0.3 percentage points (about 2% of the post-crisis mean) and decreases the fraction of total income due to these benefits by 0.2% (3% of the post-crisis mean) after the crisis. In contrast, the estimates for the public sector are smaller in absolute value and not statistically different from zero, despite the fact that this sector also experienced job reductions during the downturn.==== One potential explanation for this pattern is that the private sector responds to macroeconomic shocks by laying off ostensibly weaker (lower-birth-weight) individuals and holding on to the stronger (higher-birth-weight) ones more so than the public sector does.====We then explore why better health might make individuals less susceptible to job loss during crises. Our analysis focuses on four likely channels: educational investments, occupational sorting, the role of labor market institutions, and adult health. For example, the manufacturing industry was particularly hard-hit during the crisis, and thus one hypothesis might be that individuals with higher birth weight selected into other, less-affected industries and occupations already before the crisis. However, our results hold even when we control for industry of employment, or for 4-digit occupation, suggesting that occupational sorting is not the main mechanism at work. Similarly, there is no evidence that the effects are due to differences in educational attainment or different susceptibility to “last-in-first-out” policies, which are often argued to be an important determinant of hiring and firing decisions in the Swedish context. Turning to adult health, we do not find that the differential impact of birth weight after the crisis is mediated by the number of pre-crisis hospitalizations. However, since hospitalizations are admittedly a very rough proxy of adult health, we are unable to provide definitive evidence on the importance of this channel with our data.====Finally, in an additional analysis we show that birth weight does not have a differential effect on total income, including income from welfare and unemployment insurance payments, after the crisis. While individuals with poorer early-life health do have somewhat lower incomes in general, this finding suggests that in the context of Sweden, the social safety net is able to mitigate the additional negative effects of birth weight on total income during macroeconomic downturns.====This paper underscores the importance of health in determining labor market outcomes by showing that health, and in particular health at birth, matters more for job attachment during economic crises. Recent work has documented the importance of social assistance programs in improving early-childhood health, as well as the long-run effects of early exposure to social safety nets (Bitler and Currie, 2005, Hoynes et al., 2016). We add to this literature the idea that there could be early childhood health-related spillovers of safety net programs, as children born with better health are themselves less likely to depend on social assistance later in life. This study is also important for highlighting the role of social assistance during a crisis more generally. One of the fundamental questions about the design of optimal insurance policy is the extent to which it can mitigate morally arbitrary misfortunes of nature. By exploiting random variation in birth weight, we are able to show that social assistance, at least in the case of Sweden, appears to come to the aid of those who are born with a health disadvantage.",Birth weight and vulnerability to a macroeconomic crisis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629618307872,23 May 2019,2019,Research Article,301.0

For Silver plans, we find that issuers responded to HRP closures by increasing both premiums and deductibles, and by increasing the ratios of premiums to deductibles. This adjustment to the structure of plan prices is consistent with the hypothesis that issuers will be reluctant to adjust deductibles, because consumers tend to overweight changes in deductibles over changes in premiums.

This study complements papers such as Handel (2013), which estimate consumer welfare impacts of plan selection behaviors. We focus on complementary question: how do these consumer plan-selection behaviors affect issuer design of health plan pricing packages?====We use a Difference-in-Difference model with Plan-level Fixed Effects to estimate the pricing impacts of increases in expected expenditures generated by closure of state-operated High Risk Pools (HRPs). Because HRPs typically acted as issuers of last resort, it is unlikely that these individuals would be eligible to obtain insurance through employers or other government programs. To the extent that these high-cost individuals selected exchange plans, HRP closure would trigger an increase in expected per-capita healthcare expenditures for HIX plan buyers in those states. The 2016 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data indicates that the most expensive 2% of people under age 65 accounted for 36% of the total dollars spent by privately-insured non-elderly individuals (MEPS, 2016). Therefore, it is plausible that closure of an HRP could generate a substantial effect on expected per-capita healthcare expenditures for HIX plans, even if the number of high-cost individuals added to the HIX pool was relatively small.====Adjustments in premiums, deductibles and Maximum-Out-of-Pocket (MOOP) limits following HRP closures provide empirical evidence about issuer pricing strategies. We test whether these adjustments are consistent with the hypotheses that issuers aiming to attract low-risk individuals would be reluctant to raise deductibles, while issuers aiming to deter high-risk individuals would use increases in MOOP as a deterrence strategy.====These hypotheses stem from published empirical evidence indicating that consumers in the employer-sponsored insurance market tend to overweight deductibles relative to premiums (Bhargava et al., 2017). These authors focus on decisions made by individuals choosing among employer-sponsored plans with identical coverage, but different combinations of ex-ante and ex-post prices. At least half of these individuals (55%–61%) selected dominated plans. These buyers incurred relatively high payments for the employee-portion of annual health insurance premiums, in order to obtain relatively low deductibles==== ; however, the savings potentially generated by the reduced deductible did not justify the additional dollars the employee spent on the premium.====Fung et al. (2017) provide additional evidence that HIX plan buyers do not always make rational plan selection decisions. These authors conclude that 31% of individuals eligible for financial assistance did not receive that assistance because they purchased plans off-exchange or they selected on-exchange plans that were not Silver. Buying a non-Silver plan could be an optimizing choice for some individuals; however the large proportion of eligible individuals who did not receive assistance raises questions about the rationality of these plan-selection decisions (Health Reform Beyond the Basics, 2018). Johnson et al. (2013) show that consumers are more likely to choose cost-minimizing plans when computation aids are presented along with the plan pricing information.====However, two factors raise questions about this conclusion. First, some evidence suggests that rational behaviors play an important role in plan-selection decisions. DeLeire et al. (2017) report results indicating that HIX buyers are highly sensitive to the availability of Cost-Sharing-Reduction (CSR), and both Ericson and Starc (2012) and DeLeire and Marks (2015) conclude that consumers are highly sensitive to premiums net of Advanced Premium Tax Credits (APTCs). In contrast to the results reported by Bhargava et al. (2017) for employer-provided insurance, DeLeire et al. (2017) conclude that the proportion of HIX consumers selecting dominated plans was small.====In addition, issuer concern about the impacts of price increases on plan-selection behaviors could be tempered by heightened concern about adverse selection as high-cost individuals transition from HRPs to the HIX market. The importance of adverse selection concerns during the early years of the HIX markets is not clear. Geruso et al. (2019) conclude that the federal risk corridor, reinsurance and risk-adjustment programs for HIX markets substantially reduced the potential impact of adverse selection on insurance companies. Two of these programs were temporary: Congress discontinued funding for the Risk Corridors program after 2015, and the Reinsurance program was terminated after 2016, as specified in the Affordable Care Act (Hall, 2010)====, but the risk-adjustment program is ongoing.====Issuers concerned about adverse selection could address that issue by either focusing on attracting low-risk consumers or deterring high-risk consumers. Issuers focused on attracting low-risk consumers might note that the deductible is a salient issue for individuals anticipating low healthcare expenditures, because the deductible defines the point at which the insurer begins covering some of the cost of healthcare expenditures. These issuers would be reluctant to raise deductibles, if they believe that consumers overweight deductibles relative to premiums.====This strategy may be more useful for Silver plans, than for Gold plans. Bhargava, et al. (2017) found that low-income consumers are significantly more likely overweight deductibles relative to premiums. To the extent Gold plan consumers are higher income than Silver plan consumers (because of the higher premiums for Gold plans and the structure of the ACA subsidies), Gold plan issuers may be less worried about evidence indicating that customers overweight deductibles.====Issuers that are focused on deterring high-risk consumers might use the fact that plan MOOP is an important plan characteristic for high-cost individuals, but it is less relevant to individuals with low or moderate expected healthcare expenditures. Most individuals do not incur sufficient out-of-pocket healthcare expenditures to reach the MOOP. For these individuals, who anticipate low or moderate healthcare expenditures, the plan MOOP does not affect their out-of-pocket financial obligations. The situation is dramatically different, however, for individuals anticipating high healthcare expenditures, because the plan MOOP places a cap on their out-of-pocket expenditures. As a result of the differential impact of plan MOOP on low- and moderate-utilizers, versus high-utilizers, increases in plan MOOP would deter individuals anticipating high healthcare expenditures without affecting those anticipating low or moderate expenditures.====The impact of increases in expected healthcare expenditures on the ratio of ex-ante to ex-post prices is important because this ratio affects the shares of total population healthcare expenditures paid by insured individuals with low healthcare utilization and those with high healthcare utilization. Insured individuals who do not utilize any healthcare during a given year pay the ex-ante price (the premium), but they are not affected by the ex-post price structure. These individuals constitute a non-negligible percentage of the potential health plan buyers: 20% of individuals did not incur any healthcare expenditures in 2014 (MEPS, 2014). In contrast, insured individuals with moderate or high healthcare expenditures are affected by both the ex-ante price and the ex-post price structure. Therefore, an increase in the ratio of ex-ante to ex-post prices implies an increase in the fraction of population healthcare expenditures paid by relatively healthy individuals.====To estimate these impacts, we focus on the impacts of closures of state-operated High Risk Pools (HRPs). HRPs were operated by 35 states at the beginning of 2013, covering approximately 200,000 individuals==== . As states prepared to implement HIX markets in January 2014, 10 states closed their HRPs either on the last day of 2013 or the first day of 2014, another 10 states closed their HRPs during 2014, and a handful of states closed their HRPs during subsequent years (NASCHIP, 2016).====We leverage the fact that several state-operated HRPs closed during 2014, to estimate the impacts of an increase in expected per capita healthcare expenditures on ex-ante and ex-post prices. In these HRP-closure states, the HRP operated during the first quarter of 2014, and closed by the end of that year; hence plan designs and enrollment for the 2014 plan year were specified prior to HRP closure, while plan designs for 2015 were based on estimates of healthcare expenditures that would occur in the absence of an HRP. This data structure supports fixed effects (FE) difference in difference (DD) estimation of the impacts of HRP closure on premiums, deductibles and MOOPs.====We construct a Plan-level panel dataset using the HIX Compare data from Robert Wood Johnson Foundation for the years 2014–2017 (RWJF, 2017). After excluding states with potentially-confounding policy changes and states with missing data, the baseline sample includes five states that closed HRPs during 2014, and 13 comparison states that did not implement this policy change. We focus on DD regressions with Plan-level FE. Federal regulations limit the degree to which a continuing plan can adjust plan generosity; hence the Plan-level FE estimates provide information about price changes when the level of generosity is approximately constant. Our estimates indicate that closure of a state HRP leads to a significant 7.8% increase in premiums for Silver plans and a 4.4% increase for Gold plans. In addition, HRP closures led to a 3.6% increase in Silver plan deductibles and a 4.7% increase in MOOPs for Gold plans.====Consistent with consumer behaviors reported by Bhargava et al. (2017), issuers increased the ratios of premiums to deductibles by 4.3% for Silver plans. Issuers increased premiums and MOOPs at equal rates for Gold plans; hence the ratio remained unchanged.====Comparison of the impacts of HRP closures on constant generosity plans (Plan-level FE) and on the sets of plans offered within Rating Areas (Rating Area-level FE) provides indirect evidence that HRP closures also triggered reductions in the average plan generosity. For these reduced-generosity plans, premium increases for were offset by reductions in ex-post prices.====HRP closures generated substantial increases in the premiums for Second Lowest Cost Silver Plans (SLCSPs)==== that exceeded the average percentage increases for Silver plans. Thus, consumers eligible for APTC were largely shielded from the premium increases. Finally, HRP closures are associated with reductions in the numbers of plans offered within Rating Areas, but the closures did not alter the availability of Products or the numbers of issuers offering plans.====The remaining sections of this paper are organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe key components of the federal Medical Loss Ratio (MLR), Actuarial Value (AV) and MOOP regulations, and we develop the two hypotheses.

In this paper we exploit that many GPs, in addition to own practice, work in local emergency centres, where the matching of ==== to GPs is random. The same GP is observed both with competition (own practice) and without (emergency centre). Using high-dimensional fixed-effect models, we find that GPs with a fee-for-service (fixed-salary) contract are 12 (8) percentage points more likely to certify sick leave at own practice than at the emergency centre. Thus, competition has a positive impact on GPs’ sicklisting that is strongly reinforced by financial incentives.","Competition among physicians is widespread. Almost every country has a market-based allocation of physician services, though the scope for competition may vary according to government regulations. In particular, the extent to which prices of physician services are set administratively or determined in the market differs across public and private health care systems. In this paper we study the effect of non-price competition among physicians on their service provision in a National Health Service (NHS), and how this relationship depends on the financial incentives provided by the physicians’ remuneration schemes.====Despite the widespread presence of competition in physician markets, the empirical evidence on its impact on physicians’ service provision is surprisingly scarce.==== There are only a few papers, which we discuss below, that provide compelling evidence on the causal relationship between competition and physician behaviour. A main reason for this is that market structure is endogenous, which makes it hard to obtain plausible exogenous variation in the degree of competition. A standard regression analysis of market concentration on physicians’ service provision, as used by most of the existing literature on physician markets, will yield biased estimates. While instrumental variable approaches could be employed to deal with the endogeneity problem, the lack of data in physician markets has made this difficult.====In this paper we propose a novel approach to identify the impact of competition on physicians’ service provision. More precisely, we take advantage of the fact that many General Practitioners (GPs), in addition to their regular office practice, work in local primary care emergency centers (PCECs). At the PCECs, the physician-patient matching is random, implying that the GPs face exogenous demand and thus no competition for patients. However, at the GPs’ own practice, the matching is a result of patient choice and the GPs should realise that their treatment decisions will affect both the probability that the patient chooses to remain on the GPs’ list in the future, and also, through reputation effects, the probability that new patients will choose to be listed with the GP. Since the data allow us to observe the same GP in different competitive environments, being exposed (in own practice) or not (in emergency centre) to competition, we are in principle able to isolate the effect on competition on GP behaviour in a way that allows us to make causal inferences.====A key advantage of our approach is that it allows us to control for selection issues related to GPs’ choice of location and type of remuneration. GPs’ choice of location may potentially depend on the degree of competition in the local market. If particular GPs tend to a larger extent to locate in more competitive geographical areas, then estimations that base identification on cross-sectional variation in the degree of competition in local markets will yield biased results. In a similar way, the allocation of GPs across remuneration schemes is obviously not random, but an endogenous choice made by the GP. Given that there is selection of GPs into different reimbursement schemes, using cross-sectional variation across GPs’ remuneration yields biased results. By focusing on the same GP in two different environments, our approach accounts for these kinds of selection issues, enabling us to identify causal effects of competition on GPs’ behaviour, here measured according to their propensity to certify sickness absence for their patients.====An important issue, though, is to control for other factors (than competition) that may influence physician behaviour in the two competitive environments. To do so, we exploit rich administrative data with detailed patient-level information in Norway from 2006 to 2014. From these data, which basically cover the whole population in Norway, we select the ten most frequent acute diagnoses treated by GPs. As outcome variable, we use certification of (paid) sick leave, which is a highly frequent and standardised ‘treatment choice’ made by GPs for acute diagnoses. The detailed data allow us to estimate high-dimensional fixed-effect models using only within patient and GP variation. This implies that we control for all time-invariant unobserved (and observed) patient and GP heterogeneity. We also include diagnosis fixed-effects and control for time trend, as well as a wide set of potentially time-varying patient and GP characteristics.====Our key finding is that GPs are more likely to issue sick leave to patients that visit them at their own practice than at the emergency centre. We also find that, when exposed to competition, GPs with an activity-based (fee-for-service and capitation) contract are much more likely to offer sick leave than GPs with a fixed-salary contract. These results are economically significant. In our most preferred model, GPs with an activity-based contract are 12 percentage points more likely to offer a sick leave at their own practice than at the emergency centre, whereas the equivalent figure for GPs on fixed-salary contracts is 8 percentage points. These findings are (in qualitative terms) highly robust across a large set of specifications and sensitivity tests. We therefore conclude that competition does influence physician behaviour, and that this effect is strongly reinforced by financial incentives (i.e., activity-based remuneration of physician services).====To develop economic intuition for the results, we construct a dynamic model of GPs’ choices of sick-listing practice styles when patients differ in illness severity and thus the need for a sick leave. In the model patients always (weakly) prefer a sick leave certificate irrespective of illness severity, as it is optional to make use of it. This implies that, under competition, GPs can increase future demand by adopting a more lenient sick-listing practice style. Assuming GPs are semi-altruistic and that deviating from medical sick-listing guidelines (i.e., being too lenient) is costly for the GP, we show that the effect of exposing GPs to competition crucially depends on the GPs’ remuneration scheme. For GPs with an activity-based (fee-for-service or capitation) contract, competition always induces the GPs to be more lenient in terms of sick listing. For GPs with a fixed-salary contract, the effect of competition is ==== ambiguous. If GPs are mainly profit motivated, competition induces the GPs to adopt a stricter practice style in order to avoid (rather than attract) patients. However, the reverse is true if GPs are sufficiently altruistic and thus put a larger weight on patients’ benefit from obtaining a sick leave relative to the costs of being too lenient.====The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In the next section we review the relevant literature. In Section 3 we present the Norwegian primary care market. In Section 4 we develop a dynamic model for GPs’ sick listing practice and derive predictions for the empirical analysis. In Section 5 we present our data and provide some descriptive statistics. In Section 6 we explain our empirical strategy and in Section 7 we present our empirical results. In Section 8 we present several robustness checks and extensions in order to validate our results and empirical strategy.

I compare child and parental health of likely eligible households to a series of control groups before and after California’s PFL program was implemented. I find improvements in parent-reported overall child health and suggestive improvements in maternal mental health status. Findings also suggest a reduction in asthma and a greater likelihood that parents feel they are coping well with the day-to-day demands of parenting. There are no significant effects on respiratory or food allergies, or father’s mental health status. The results are robust to multiple control groups and ==== tests.","Calls for a national paid family leave (PFL) program in the United States have attracted serious attention in recent years. In 2011, President Obama unsuccessfully proposed to allocate $50 million in competitive grants to states that start PFL programs. More recently, the Family and Medical Insurance Leave (FAMILY) Act – proposed in 2013 and again in 2015 and 2017 – would have provided 12 weeks of paid leave at a 66 percent wage replacement rate. Despite these efforts, the U.S. remains the only developed country without a PFL program.====Six states plus the District of Columbia currently have paid family leave programs allowing employees partially paid time off work to care for a new child. For example, California’s PFL program now provides six weeks of leave at 60-70 percent of weekly earnings (capped at $1,216 per week), depending on earnings levels. In August 2018 the average weekly benefit amount was $674 and total benefits paid in 2018 were nearly $864 million.====With one exception (Das and Polachek, 2015), research has shown that California’s PFL program has improved mothers’ labor market outcomes. The program doubled the length of leave taken from an average of three weeks to between six and eight weeks, especially among low-educated, unmarried, and minority mothers (Baum and Ruhm, 2016; Rossin-Slater et al., 2013). As a result of greater short-term labor force attachment of women who would have otherwise temporarily exited the labor force (Byker, 2016), mothers’ employment and wages have improved after childbirth (Baum and Ruhm, 2016; Rossin-Slater et al., 2013). Further evidence suggests that higher benefit amounts modestly increase employment up to two years following leave (Bana et al., 2018).====Recent research also suggests California’s PFL program improved child health. Lichtman-Sadot and Pillay Bell (2017) find California’s PFL program improved the health of elementary school-aged children by reducing the prevalence of overweight, ADHD, and hearing-related problems. Pihl and Basso (2019) find California’s PFL reduced hospitalizations among infants for avoidable infections and illnesses. With these exceptions, little else is known about the health and human capital impacts of California’s PFL program.====Several papers study the effect of expanding paid leave on child health and well-being in other countries. For example, expanding paid leave in Canada (Baker and Milligan, 2008, 2010, 2015), Germany (Dustmann and Schönberg, 2012), Sweden (Liu and Skans, 2010), Norway (Dahl et al., 2016), and Denmark (Beuchert et al., 2016) from between two and fifteen months had little to no significant impacts on child outcomes at various ages or maternal mental health. In these countries, however, leave lengths provided by policies were already substantially longer than the shorter leaves typically available in the United States. In contrast, for instance, in the U.S. the introduction of both twelve weeks of unpaid and six weeks of paid maternity leave for birth mothers through Temporary Disability Insurance (TDI) improved birth outcomes and reduced infant mortality rates (Rossin, 2011; Stearns, 2015). The sum of this literature then begets the question of whether a six week leave program in the U.S. has any health effects on infants or mothers.====There are several mechanisms through which paid family leave could affect children’s health. For example, policies that lengthen parental leave increase the amount of time parents can spend with their infants. This extra time may affect nonparental care, breastfeeding duration, parental engagement, and parental mental health, stress and anxiety, all of which have been linked to child health. Paid leave – compared to no leave or unpaid leave – may also smooth household earnings immediately following childbirth; even slight increases in income are known to positively affect child health and development and maternal health (Milligan and Stabile, 2011).====To examine the relationship between partially paid parental leave and children’s and parental health and well-being, I use data from the National Survey of Children’s Health (NSCH). I compare the health of infants and their parents in California to several control groups to construct a series of difference-in-differences (DD) estimators. I also conduct within-state comparisons of infants to older children in a difference-in-difference-in-differences (DDD) analysis. I find PFL in California improved overall parent-reported infant health and likely improved respondent-reported maternal mental health. There is suggestive evidence of a reduction in parent-reported asthma, and parents are also more likely to feel they are coping well with day-to-day demands of parenting. There are no significant effects on respiratory allergies, food allergies, or father’s mental health. Finally, I find reductions in nonparental childcare and suggested increases in parental engagement (as measured by reading to children). In addition to improved economic well-being (Baum and Ruhm, 2016; Rossin-Slater et al., 2013; Stanczyk, 2016), the child health improvements may be the result of better maternal mental health status and greater parental care and engagement.",The Effect of Paid Family Leave on Infant and Parental Health in the United States,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629617305799,16 May 2019,2019,Research Article,304.0

These laws may have curtailed teenagers' use of e-cigarettes for ,"Smoking is one of the leading causes of poor birth outcomes in the United States (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2014). For this reason, women smokers may be especially motivated to quit smoking during pregnancy, with subsequent health benefits for both themselves and their offspring.====The relatively recent introduction of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) (which people ==== rather than ====) has provided pregnant women with a smoking cessation product option similar in some respects to FDA-approved nicotine replacement therapies (e.g. patch, gum) and smoking cessation medications (e.g. Chantix, Zyban). However, the safety of using ENDS for smoking cessation during pregnancy has received an inconclusive grade from the United States Preventive Services Task Force (Siu and Force, 2015). Vaping nicotine during pregnancy is risky primarily because nicotine, which is in most ENDS, is harmful to the developing fetus (Royal College of Physicians, 2016).====Minimum legal sale age (MLSA) laws have long been in place for traditional cigarettes. While there is evidence that these laws reduce smoking among youth (Ertan Yörük and Yörük, 2016) many youth continue to find ways to evade these laws. For example, in 2016 7.7% of teens giving birth smoked. One option that pregnant teens may consider to reduce or quit cigarette smoking during their pregnancy is to use ENDS. If ENDS access is restricted by ENDS MLSA laws, then the ENDS MLSA laws could have an unintended effect of reducing prenatal smoking cessation. The extent to which pregnant teens switch from cigarette smoking to ENDS, and the extent to which this switching is reduced by ENDS MLSAs, could indicate an unmet desire and need for smoking cessation assistance.====The objective of our paper is to evaluate the effect of ENDS MLSAs on prenatal smoking of traditional cigarettes and on birth outcomes. Our paper is the first to explore the effect of ENDS MLSAs on pregnant teens’ smoking. A previous study found that among adult pregnant women living in states that comprehensively banned indoor smoking of traditional cigarettes in public places, indoor vaping restrictions increased smoking in a given trimester by 2.0 percentage points (pp), or 31% of the mean. However, these indoor vaping restrictions had no measurable impact on birth outcomes including low birth weight, premature birth, small-for-gestational age, and Apgar 5 score (Cooper and Pesko, 2017).====The current paper revisits the important question of the impact of ENDS regulations on prenatal smoking and birth outcomes using ENDS MLSAs as an alternative source of policy variation, and focusing on pregnant teens. In addition, we look carefully at which demographic groups are most affected, and find that the effects are concentrated on rural teens. A second contribution of our paper is the use of longitudinal data to explore the effects of ENDS MLSAs on smoking. Four studies have explored this question using cross-sectional two-way fixed effects models, and there is some disagreement among the estimates. Three of these studies found that ENDS MLSAs increased teen smoking by approximately 0.8–1.0 pp (Dave et al., 2019; Friedman, 2015; Pesko et al., 2016), while a fourth study used Monitoring the Future data and found that ENDS MLSAs decreased smoking participation of high school seniors by 2.0 pp (Abouk and Adams, 2017). At least one other study suggests that ENDS are complements with cigarettes, although within a sample of primarily adult cigarette smokers (Cotti et al., 2018). Our study will help shed light on this issue using a longitudinal analysis.====A key assumption underlying our analysis is that in the absence of ENDS MLSA restrictions, prenatal smoking would have followed parallel trends in counties with and without such restrictions. We find that this parallel trends assumption is satisfied for rural areas, and that within these counties ENDS MLSAs increased smoking in a given trimester by 0.6 pp overall (4.8% of the mean). These effects are concentrated among teens who smoked in the 3 months prior to their pregnancy, suggesting that overall rates of prenatal smoking increased because of reduced smoking cessation rather than new smoking initiation. The parallel trends assumption is not satisfied for urban and suburban areas, suggesting that we can provide little insight on the effects of ENDS MLSAs in these areas. We also find little evidence that ENDS MLSAs affected birth outcomes in any setting, though that may reflect low power to detect effects.====Our focus on rural areas is important because rural areas account for a disproportionate share of teen pregnancies: 4.9% of rural 15–19 year old females give birth compared to 3.8% in urban areas and 2.4% in suburban areas. Additionally, since 2007, the rate of teen births has fallen more slowly in rural counties than in urban and suburban counties, so the gap in teen birth rates between rural and urban areas is increasing (Hamilton et al., 2016). Prenatal smoking rates are also much higher among rural underage pregnant teens—in 2010 13.7% of rural underage pregnant teens smoked compared to 8.8% in suburban areas and 2.9% in urban areas.==== Therefore, our focus on rural areas captures a disproportionate share of teen prenatal smokers.",E-cigarette minimum legal sale age laws and traditional cigarette use among rural pregnant teenagers,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629618308129,13 May 2019,2019,Research Article,305.0

This article estimates the short-term effect of retirement on cognitive performance of elderly Australians by exploiting the exogenous variation in retirement decisions induced by changes in social security eligibility rules. The empirical results show that on average retirement has a negative but modest effect on cognition, and the rate of cognitive decline with age is greater for men than women. The results for women display no significant effects on working memory and speed of information processing. The article further adds to the literature by providing evidence on the possible mechanisms through which retirement could affect individual's cognitive performance. We find that moving into retirement leads women to increase the time spent in mental and household activities, which may in part explain the modest effect we observe for women.","As nations experience population ageing, increasing attention is being focused on individual's economic and social participation at older ages. A fundamental aspect of the ageing process is that individuals’ cognitive functioning tends to deteriorate over the later stages of the life cycle.==== However, this cognitive decline is neither exogenous nor uniform, it is influenced by individuals’ lifestyle and choices (Börsch-Supan et al., 2013) with some individuals maintaining cognitive vitality even into extreme old age (Silver et al., 2001). While specific dimensions of cognition, particularly applied to ‘fluid intelligence’, such as episodic memory, abstract reasoning and information processing speed, generally are in decline, other dimensions related to ‘crystallized intelligence’, such as ability to draw on experiences and personality, have been found to remain stable into old age (McArdle et al., 2002, Rohwedder and Willis, 2010).==== More importantly, interventions and significant life events may alter the process of cognitive ageing. Empirical research has shown that important factors in this process include education (Banks and Mazzonna, 2012), leisure activities and lifestyle (Scarmeas and Stern, 2003), occupational and retirement choices (Adam et al., 2006, Bonsang et al., 2012, Rohwedder and Willis, 2010). Retirement, in particular, may be a potential trigger for cognitive change, assuming that retirees leave cognitive demanding paid work (Mazzonna and Peracchi, 2012, Xue et al., 2017). While retirement may decrease the work-related stress, it is a major life event that may cause substantial changes and readjustments (Minkler, 1981; Heller-Sahlgren, 2017), often accompanied by a decrease in income and consumption (Bernheim et al., 2001).====Establishing a causal effect of retirement on cognition is empirically challenging since the retirement decision is not random; poor mental health may directly induce retirement, and unobserved individual heterogeneity, and time-varying confounding factors can affect both the retirement decision and cognitive capacity. When employing different identification strategies to this non-random selection into retirement, the previous literature tends to be conclusive in finding a negative retirement effect on cognition (see Rohwedder and Willis, 2010, Bonsang et al., 2012, Mazzonna and Peracchi, 2012, Mazzonna and Peracchi, 2017, Celidoni et al., 2017). The existing studies, mainly based on data from a selected set of countries, such as the U.S. Health and Retirement Study (HRS), the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) and the Survey on Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), limit the scope of retirement-cognition analysis to the US and Europe, and importantly most studies lack of available data on fluid intelligence.====The current article builds on these analyses and makes several contributions to the international literature. First, we examine the hypothesis that retirement has a causal impact on cognitive functioning using data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) panel survey which adds Australian evidence to this literature. This panel is of unusually high quality and has several unique design features which makes it well suited to the measurement of the retirement and cognition relationship. The data allows us to include measures of both fluid and crystallized cognitive abilities thus providing additional evidence of the retirement effect on different cognitive domains. We address the issue of causality using the panel structure of the data and account for the endogeneity of retirement status by exploiting a major reform of the Australian Age Pension which substantially changed individual's retirement incentives.==== In the HILDA Survey, a person's cognitive functioning is measured at two points in time, in 2012 and 2016, and this allows us to estimate the effect that transition from work into retirement has on individuals’ cognitive functioning. Second, we highlight the differences between men and women in estimated retirement effects and the prevalence of cognitive impairments. Few studies in the literature focus on the relationship between retirement and cognitive function with a gender focus, and the results are inconclusive.==== Third, we explore a wide range of mental exercise activities, social behaviours and time use that can potentially drive the cognitive effects of the transition into retirement. The existing empirical studies provide evidence that retirement may affect cognition; however, there is little empirical evidence on the mechanisms through which retirement affects cognitive functioning.==== Finally, we highlight that establishing the causal link between retirement and cognitive functioning is important for public policy. Many countries have begun increasing statutory state pension eligibility ages with the intention to induce longer work careers and postponed retirement. The outcome of such policies in terms of reducing government expenditure on social security depends on the impact of postponed retirement. Working longer may delay cognitive decline while programs to assist a socially engaged and active retirement may be required to reduce cognition decline during this pivotal phase.====We find that the causal short-run effect of retirement for women is modest and retirement is not associated with either a significant decline in working memory nor speed of information processing. For men we find significant short-run effects on both word reading and working memory along with a negative effect of retirement duration. Examining the possible mechanisms through which retirement may influence individual's cognitive performance we find that with the transition into retirement women are more likely to spend their time in reading, club membership, household and volunteer activities. We do not observe any significant changes for men which could help explain the gender differences in cognitive functioning associated with the transition into retirement.====The remainder of the article is organized as follows.

During this same period, states enacted teen driver licensure provisions in an á la carte fashion, now collectively referred to as graduated driver licensing (GDL) programs, that restricted teen driving. While the literature demonstrates that ‘good’ GDL programs reduce vehicular fatalities, how these reductions occur remains open. In this study, separate GDL provisions and ==== laws are studied to understand reduction mechanisms. The evaluation is based on a state-by-year panel and uses difference-in-difference and triple-difference specifications to identify causal impacts on rates of licensing, vehicular fatalities, and fatalities per licensee.====The empirical results find that the ==== provision reduces licensing of 16- to 17-year-old teens by 20.1%, and no other licensure provision consistently impacts licensing. In addition, vehicular fatalities decrease from the ==== provision by 22.7%, the ==== provision by 5.9%, and ==== laws by 7.3%, while vehicular fatalities increase from the ==== provision by 6.3%. Furthermore, only ==== have impacts on vehicular fatalities per 16- to 17-year-old licensed female and few long-term impacts are identified on those ages 18–20 who ‘graduated’ from licensing programs. This research suggests that GDL programs affect vehicular fatalities mostly through incapacitation, rather than programmatically.","It is well known that teens and young adults have the highest rates of traffic fatalities. For example, in 1996, 84.8 vehicular fatalities per 100,000 licensees occurred involving drivers ages 16–17, compared to 70.8 involving drivers ages 18–20, and 24.6 involving drivers ages 40–59.==== While teen and young adults involved in accidents resulting in fatalities are elevated relative to older individuals, their rates of decline are faster. Between 1996 and 2015, traffic fatalities declined 68.7% among 16- to 17-year-olds, compared to 45.4% among 18- to 20-year-olds and 23.6% among 40- to 59-year-olds (see Fig. 1b).==== Past research has shown these reductions to be causally related to teen driver licensure restrictions, now collectively referred to as Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL) programs. Since the late 1980s, states have enacted á la carte GDL provisions that require teens to advance through a series of gates and restrictions to acquire critical driving skills and experience in low-risk monitored settings in an effort to reduce vehicular fatalities.====GDL programs have become the premier policy initiative designed to improve traffic safety among teens, with states passing some or all of the nine key teen licensure provisions over the last twenty-five years. While the literature on the efficacy of GDL programs has demonstrated reductions in vehicular fatalities within populations, researchers have continually emphasized the lack of evidence on the mechanisms that reduce fatalities. For example, Shope (2007) identifies six national studies of GDL programs on teen vehicular fatalities, all reporting at least some significant reductions in fatalities within teen and young adult populations.==== These studies focus on teen driver or teen vehicular fatalities, and most do not augment the analysis by estimating changes in the rate of driver licensing or fatalities per licensee. Salient to this concern is whether GDL programs have programmatic impact, reducing ====, or simply incapacitation, reducing ====, by restricting teens from driving. Furthermore, due to the multifaceted approaches of GDL programs to teen driving, researchers often rely on GDL strength indices to estimate causal impacts.==== While indices reduce the dimensionality of GDL programs, they do not permit an understanding of which GDL provisions affect rates of licensing and vehicular fatalities, i.e., an inspection of the mechanism reducing fatalities.====In this study, I present new state-level panel analysis on the effects of GDL program provisions and ==== laws on the rate of driver licensing, vehicular fatalities, and vehicular fatalities per licensee involving teens and young adults. The empirical specifications are difference-in-difference and triple-difference Poisson count and linear models that account for a host of covariates, state and birth cohort fixed effects, and state-specific and age-specific time trends to identify the causal impact of GDL provisions and ==== laws. The results by gender suggest heterogeneous effects. Following the literature, I validate the critical assumptions of the difference-in-difference specification by analyzing the impact on older drivers, those 18- to 20-year-olds who ‘graduated,’ and by analyzing the contemporaneous impact on those ages 40–59 who were never affected by the licensure provisions. Additionally, those ages 18–20 are used as a control group in triple-difference specifications.====Three pieces of empirical evidence suggest that GDL provisions may have strong incapacitation effects. First, time series of drivers per capita over the last twenty years indicate substantial changes in the rates teens obtain licenses. Between 1996 and 2015, drivers per capita of 16- to 17-year-olds fell by 33.3% while 18- to 20-year-olds fell by 6.0% and 40- to 59-year-olds fell by 4.4% (see Fig. 1a). Second, Williams et al. (2005) provide descriptive evidence that vehicular fatalities per licensed 16-year-old drivers between 1993 and 2003 did not change significantly, during a period of substantial uptake of GDL provisions. Third, Karaca-Mandic and Ridgeway (2010) find that ‘good’ GDL programs reduce accidents by limiting the prevalence of teen drivers in twelve states.====This study makes several distinct contributions to the literature. First, I disaggregate GDL programs into seven licensure provisions that restrict those ages 16–17 to identify specific aspects of GDL programs that cause the impact on vehicular fatalities (see Table A.1 for all provision implementation dates). As early as 2002, researchers emphasized the need to assess the individual GDL components, e.g., McKnight and Peck, 2002, and I am unaware of any research that provides individual GDL provision impact estimates. This is important as indices may mask ineffective policies and may also cause omitted variable bias if not all GDL provisions are included. Second, I analyze ==== laws that restrict teens from driving due to truancy, poor grades and school-related misbehavior, and were enacted during the same period as GDL provisions. Third, I analyze changes in rates of licensing, vehicular fatalities, and vehicular fatalities per licensee to provide insight into the mechanisms of reduction. Fourth, the vehicular fatality measure in this research is broader than most of the literature, as it includes all fatalities involving teen drivers and more accurately accounts for the costs of teen driving.====The paper also examines whether there are heterogeneous effects observed by gender for those ages 16–17. There are four compelling reasons to do so. First, the traffic safety literature has found consistent evidence that young adult females have higher fatality risk than young adult males. For example, a technical report released by the NHTSA (Kahane, 2013) estimates that the relative vehicular fatality risks for females to be 11.9–29.1 percent higher than males, and that young adult females have even higher relative vehicular fatality risks than young adult males and adult females. The traffic safety literature stresses the physiological response differences to physical impact, regardless if this trauma occurred as a driver, a passenger, or as a pedestrian struck by a vehicle (Evans, 1988). Second, GDL program compliance may differ by gender. This is consistent with Li et al. (1998) who show male drivers are more likely to engage in risky driving practices, including not using seatbelts, driving while impaired, and speeding. This suggests that females may be more likely to comply with the licensure restrictions than males, making the restrictions more effective for females than males. Third, Barua and Vidal-Fernandez (2014) find that ==== laws have positive and significant effects on the number of years of school completed and on the probability of high school completion among boys and blacks, but not girls. They also find reduced truancy and an increase in time allocated to schoolwork (with a corresponding decrease in time allocated to leisure). This suggests that ==== laws likely impact males and not females. Fourth, a recent study cosponsored by IIHS and Liberty Mutual insurance company finds that while females tend to be safer drivers, this is becoming less the case for female teenage drivers (IIHS, 2009). Their estimates suggest an increase in the number of teenage female drivers involved in accidents or near misses due to distracted driving with cellphones, music players, and other causes.====The difference-in-difference results suggest that GDL programs reduce rates of licensing and vehicular fatalities for those ages 16–17. Additionally, no consistent impacts are identified on fatalities per licensee. The causal impact of licensure provisions on 16- to 17-year-old male and female licensing rates are similar in magnitude, while the impacts of GDL provisions on vehicular fatalities are greater for females than males, and the impact of ==== laws is exclusive to males. The reductions in licensing and fatalities among 16- to 17-year-olds are attributable to three of the seven GDL provisions studied. A ==== reduces licensing of 16- to 17-year-olds by 20.1% and no other GDL provision has a significant effect on rates of licensing. A ==== provision reduces fatalities of 16- to 17-year-olds by 22.9%, and the ==== provision by 17.6%. Interestingly, the provision ==== increases fatalities by 6.3%. The increase in fatalities is insufficient to offset the overall decline, indicating ‘good’ GDL programs have a net reduction in fatalities of approximately 32.5%. In addition, ==== laws reduce vehicular fatalities by 7.6%. The impact of licensure provisions on licensing and vehicular fatalities of those ages 18–20 are small and no impacts are identified on those ages 40–59. The pre-policy analysis and triple-difference estimations fortify the difference-in-difference results. This research suggests that GDL programs affect vehicular fatalities through incapacitation, rather than programmatically. In the concluding section, policy implications are discussed in more detail.","Teen driver licensure provisions, licensing, and vehicular fatalities",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629618307641,10 May 2019,2019,Research Article,307.0

This paper examines the case for MUPs in an optimal ","A minimum unit price (MUP) for alcohol is a prohibition of alcohol sales at prices less than some minimum level per unit of ethanol content. Related policies have been introduced in Canadian provinces (Stockwell et al., 2012a, Stockwell et al., 2012b, Sharma et al., 2014). However, they typically set minimum prices per liquid volume by drink type, rather than per ethanol content. The Scottish government introduced minimum unit pricing in May 2018. A similar proposal has been approved by the National Assembly for Wales.====This paper examines the microeconomic foundations for a MUP. The optimal mix of a corrective tax and a MUP is characterized analytically, and some determinants of this mix are explored with a numerical example. I find that a corrective tax will generally be beneficial, even when a MUP has been imposed. I also propose a sufficient condition for a MUP to be part of the optimal policy combination. This condition is satisfied when relatively cheap forms of alcohol are undertaxed, and the quality and quantity of alcohol are substitutes. A numerical example illustrates how adoption of a MUP can require the optimal tax to be lower than otherwise, and to be more sensitive to elasticity of demand.====The socially optimal use of a MUP has not been addressed in the previous literature, but there are two strands of research that are relevant. The first strand investigates socially optimal alcohol taxes in the absence of a minimum price (Pogue and Sgontz, 1989, Saffer and Chaloupka, 1994, Kenkel, 1996, Griffith et al., 2019). The second strand models the likely effects of minimum unit pricing (Meier et al., 2010, Sharma et al., 2014, Holmes et al., 2014).====The first strand of relevant literature deals with tax rates on alcohol. Optimal tax rates have sometimes been calculated by minimizing aggregate deadweight losses across consumer types, where these deadweight losses are inferred from elasticities. This approach was proposed by Pogue and Sgontz (1989), and followed by Saffer and Chaloupka (1994) and then Kenkel (1996). Pogue and Sgontz (1989) assumed two types of drinker, abusers and nonabusers, with an extension to a disease model of alcoholism. Saffer and Chaloupka (1994) incorporated cross-price elasticities, and evaluated the case for taxing the alcohol content in each beverage equally. Kenkel (1996) extended the framework, distinguishing between heavy drinkers who are informed or uninformed. In contrast, my analysis is presented in terms of utility functions rather than areas under demand functions.====Both Parry et al. (2009) and Aronsson and Sjögren (2010) analyze optimal alcohol taxes with reference to utility functions. However, they assume a representative consumer and do not allow for variation in product quality. Griffith et al. (2019) do acknowledge product variety and heterogeneity among drinkers, and investigate the possibility that different tax rates be imposed on alcoholic drinks with different marginal harms.====Heterogeneity among alcohol drinkers reduces the welfare that can be attained with a single corrective tax. When marginal externalities and internalities differ among drinkers, a single tax rate cannot simultaneously match the distortions for every individual (Crawford et al., 2010). Griffith et al. (2019) consider two cases, tax rates differentiated by beverage and a single tax rate on ethanol for all beverages. In the analysis below, I will take the position that it is not feasible for tax rates on pure alcohol content to differ with marginal harm. Instead, I will consider supplementary regulation as a response to this heterogeneity.====In general, when harms are heterogeneous but the rate of the corrective tax cannot be differentiated, then there may be a case for regulation (Christiansen and Smith, 2012) that targets relatively undertaxed harms. An application to a MUP for alcohol is suggested by claims that such a policy would have the most impact on excessive drinkers (Holmes et al., 2014, Sharma et al., 2016).====The following analysis focuses on the optimal combination of a corrective tax and a Minimum Unit Price, rather than a corrective tax in isolation. Like Griffith et al. I assume that alcoholic drinks differ in their quality, but unlike Griffith et al. I model vertical quality as a continuous choice variable, rather than accounting for product differentiation by assuming discrete types of beverage.====The second strand of literature that is relevant to the current study simulates the effects of a Minimum Unit Price, drawing on estimates of own- and cross-price elasticities of various types of alcohol. A prominent example is the Sheffield study, (Meier et al., 2010, Purshouse et al., 2010, Holmes et al., 2014, Brennan et al., 2015). This work has been used to advocate for introduction of a MUP, by arguing that the burden on moderate drinkers would be relatively small while heavier drinkers would respond with significant reductions in alcohol consumption. Another example is Sharma et al. (2016), who consider alcohol purchases in Victoria, Australia, and suggest that the largest impacts of a MUP would be for ‘at risk’ households.====Simulation studies have also assessed the extent to which lower income groups would bear the incidence of increased costs and improved health. Sharma et al. (2014) and Vandenberg and Sharma (2016) report that a MUP might be favored over a tax, in that it can have a substantial impact on drinking without particularly disadvantaging low income groups.====In addition to the simulation studies, some research has estimated the effects of related policies. Substantial impacts have been found for policies in Canada (Stockwell et al., 2012a, Stockwell et al., 2012b, Thompson et al., 2017).====My study differs because it explicitly adopts the normative framework of welfare economics, and examines the determinants of optimal policy in that framework. Unlike the previous literature on MUPs, I will provide a general characterization of policy settings that maximize aggregate welfare, accounting for externalities or internalities. I will focus on social efficiency rather than on effectiveness or equity, and will not estimate the effects of particular proposals for MUPs that have been made by politicians or public health advocates. My study focuses on foundational and conceptual issues, rather than on evaluating a specific level for a minimum unit price.====As noted above, I treat quality as a continuous product characteristic, instead of representing quality impacts in terms of cross-price elasticities between discrete categories of beverage. Each approach to modeling quality has advantages and disadvantages. It is useful for quality to be an explicit choice variable in theoretical analysis of MUPs, because then a price floor is compatible with zero profits in a long-run competitive equilibrium. However, discrete product types are convenient for incorporating estimated cross-price elasticities of demand.====One advantage of modeling quality as a continuous variable is that it highlights the deadweight losses from a MUP, losses that a corrective tax would not produce. In particular, if a corrective tax raised prices to be commensurate with social costs, then the resulting quality substitution would not be distortionary. A similar increase in price due to introduction of a MUP would also result in quality substitution, but this time it would introduce distortions. Quality would no longer be socially efficient, conditional on quantity.====The disadvantage of a corrective tax is that it is imposed on plausibly undistorted consumption by moderate drinkers as well as on distorted consumption by excessive drinkers. The disadvantage of a MUP is that it distorts quality choices. However, the two disadvantages are not symmetric. There is a general case for taxing consumption of alcohol, so long as there are negative externalities or internalities. The case for a MUP is less general, it depends on substitutability between quantity and quality.",Minimum unit prices for alcohol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629618300201,9 May 2019,2019,Research Article,308.0

Comorbidity is a situation in which an individual develops more than one disease or condition simultaneously. The threat of comorbidities has been increasing and will continue to increase because comorbidities tend to appear more frequently with age, and the population is aging around the world. For example, smoking can cause several diseases==== such as psychiatric disorders and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) if individuals smoke over a long period of time (see, for example, Breslau (1995)). This suggests that the comorbidities caused by smoking increase as people age.====Because sufficient data has been collected and the mechanism has been clarified in the case of smoking, we can estimate the chances of comorbidities caused by smoking from the symptoms of the primary disease. For example, a doctor can doubt the possibility of schizophrenia (the secondary disease) in addition to COPD (the primary disease) in the case of a smoker based on a study by Wium-Andersen et al. (2015). However, this is likely to be an exceptional case. People’s lifestyles and dietary habits have changed dramatically over recent decades, but the long-term impact of these changes on our health is unknown. Thus, we are facing many new and as yet unidentified threat in terms of comorbidity as the population ages. One example of a new threat is too much (time spent) sitting, which has been shown to cause a range of serious diseases, as reported in various studies (see Hamilton et al. (2008), Owen et al. (2010), and Owen (2012)).====Let us turn the clock back to a time when it was not known, even among doctors, that too much sitting could cause various diseases. However, doctors could estimate the possibility of comorbidities based on their experience and common sense after examining numerous individuals who engaged in work that involved excessive sitting. Because of a lack of evidence,==== however, these estimates were unreliable compared with the case involving comorbidities caused by smoking.====How do we describe the threat of comorbidity given this lack of evidence? “Ambiguity” is a notion that can be used to describe as yet unidentified threat of comorbidity. Cerreia-Vioglio et al. (2013) define ambiguity as ==== We can classify the cases of smoking and too much sitting presented above as either having or lacking sufficient evidence, respectively, to detect comorbidities. We can also say that the latter case is “more uncertain” than the former case, and “more uncertain” can be described by applying the notion of “risk” in the former case and the notion of “ambiguity” in the latter case.====The study of ambiguity commenced with the classical notion introduced by Knight (1921), and its importance was illustrated by the famous experiment of Ellsberg (1961). Many ambiguity models have been proposed that have axiomatic foundations and describe observed choices. Klibanoff et al. (2005) proposed the smooth ambiguity model, which has received a great deal of attention from the viewpoint of various applications. Berger et al. (2013) introduced ambiguity into medical decision-making based on the smooth ambiguity model. However, while this study considered only one source of uncertainty, which was ambiguous, we consider multiple sources of uncertainty, and thus the level of uncertainty is different. This situation involves the coexistence of risk and ambiguity. Bleichrodt et al. (2003) considered the willingness to pay (WTP) for health improvement under comorbidity risk, while Liu (2004) showed that individuals will spend more money to reduce the possibility of developing a primary disease when the severity of comorbidity is greater.====The studies mentioned above described uncertainty in relation to comorbidity as risk. This study extends the analysis to include comorbidity ambiguity. We describe situations in which an individual faces potential threat of comorbidity that formally express the correlation between primary and secondary diseases. If insufficient evidence is available, ambiguity is introduced into the parameter that determines the correlation, in other words, an individual is unsure whether comorbidity risk is high or low. The WTP is regarded as one of the most popular and appropriate tools for measuring the benefits of medical treatment and represents the maximum amount an individual is prepared to pay to improve their health condition. In other words, an individual has a greater propensity to opt for medical treatment when their WTP is high. This study examines conditions under which the WTP for health improvement increases with comorbidity ambiguity compared with the corresponding risk case.====Evidence regarding the harmful effects of too much sitting is mounting, and so ambiguity in relation to comorbidities caused by too much sitting is decreasing. This situation can be captured by changes in ambiguity. We determine the conditions under which an increase in ambiguity increases the WTP. Conversely, a decrease in ambiguity decreases the WTP, which corresponds to the situation in relation to mounting evidence of too much sitting. We also consider how changes in ambiguity aversion affect the WTP. In addition to the smooth ambiguity model, other influential ambiguity models, the maxmin expected utility model by Gilboa and Schmeidler (1989) and the ==== -maxmin model by Ghirardato et al. (2004), are considered in this part. The maxmin expected utility model can be viewed as an extreme case of both the smooth ambiguity and ==== -maxmin models.====Finally, we introduce ambiguity into both primary and secondary diseases and determine the conditions under which the introduction of ambiguity increases the WTP. We consider a situation in which all risks, that is, of primary disease, secondary disease, and comorbidity, are perfectly correlated. For example, when an individual faces high (low) comorbidity risk, the individual is likely to exhibit bad (good) overall health. Thus, the individual faces high (low) probabilities of both primary and secondary diseases.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the model. Section 3 examines the effect of comorbidity ambiguity on the WTP for health improvement. In Section 4, we examine how changes in ambiguity and ambiguity aversion affect the WTP. In Section 5, we consider the effect of introducing ambiguity into primary and secondary diseases on the WTP.

Annuity markets that account for differences in the longevity risk by health status can effectively reduce the consumption risks, but only slightly decrease old-age poverty. A policy analysis of minimum pension benefits indicates that a means test mitigates the associated moral hazard problem substantially.","The strong association between health and socio-economic status is a robust finding and is discussed by a large body of literature (for an overview, see Cutler and Lleras-Muney, 2012, Grossman, 2006). While there is little robust evidence that income affects health in developed countries,==== there is strong evidence that a substantial share of income inequality can be explained by health (Deaton, 2003). In fact, health shocks are found to be one of the main determinants of labor market participation and early retirement. Both unemployment and early retirement reduce an individual's expected life cycle income. As pointed out by Deaton (2003), this is due to the fact that individuals cannot fully insure their earnings against health risks. For this reason, public insurance mechanisms are particularly relevant for the insurance of individuals against the risk of health-related old-age poverty.====Several recent studies analyze wage and employment risks within a life cycle framework (e.g. Low, 2005, Low et al., 2010, Adda et al., 2013, Heathcote et al., 2014). Furthermore, Low and Pistaferri (2015) investigate the insurance value of disability benefits and incentive costs. This study adds to the literature on life cycle risks by analyzing the health-related risks of consumption and old-age poverty on the basis of a dynamic life cycle model of health, employment, early retirement, and wealth accumulation. Since health shocks affect labor supply, retirement, and saving behavior, it is important to account for all three behavioral margins and their interplay with the public insurance mechanisms (i.e. unemployment insurance, social assistance, and disability pension). In particular, the model allows for health effects on employment risks, on productivity, on longevity, the correlation between health risks, productivity and preferences, and the financial incentives of the German public insurance schemes. A policy analysis investigates a budgetary neutral introduction of minimum pension benefits as insurance against old-age poverty. Following a theoretical argument of Golosov and Tsyvinski (2006) that a means test may prevent false claims of benefits, I compare means-tested with non-means-tested schemes.====This study makes three main research contributions. First, I present a methodological framework that is particularly suited to quantify the health-related risks of consumption and old-age poverty. It not only accounts for all relevant behavioral margins and the public insurance schemes, but also allows for the correlation of unobserved heterogeneity in the health risks, productivity and preferences through a joint estimation of the behavioral model, the wage equation, and the health transitions (for a discussion of these mechanisms, also see Capatina, 2015, French and Jones, 2017). This is implemented using an extension of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm (as proposed by Arcidiacono and Jones (2003)). Second, I apply this framework to quantify losses in average annual consumption and the share of old-age poverty that can be attributed to health shocks. This is done by comparing simulated outcomes for a representative synthetic sample with the respective outcomes of a simulated benchmark scenario where no health shocks occur. Third, the results of this analysis motivate the simulation of minimum pension benefits as insurance against old-age poverty. While this raises the level of public insurance for health-related risks, it also raises a concern about an increase in abuse of the disability pension. However, the simulations suggest that a means test mitigates the moral hazard problem substantially. This finding supports the theoretical argument of Golosov and Tsyvinski (2006).====The life cycle model is based on a dynamic programming discrete choice (DPDC) framework (similar to e.g. Rust and Phelan, 1997, French, 2005, van der Klaauw and Wolpin, 2008, French and Jones, 2011, Haan and Prowse, 2014) that accounts for dynamic incentives induced by public insurance schemes and path dependencies of health and employment. The model serves two main purposes: (1) It allows deriving life cycle implications of health shocks and reform scenarios under current institutions and for individuals that have been recently observed in the labor force (no historical institutions and data); (2) behavioral responses can be taken into account when simulating counterfactual scenarios. The model is estimated using data on male employees from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) and by applying an extension of the EM algorithm. The algorithm has been proposed by Arcidiacono and Jones (2003) for the estimation of finite mixture models with time-constant unobserved heterogeneity and allows for a sequential estimation of the parameters, see Arcidiacono (2004), Arcidiacono et al. (2007) for other applications. Following Arcidiacono and Jones (2003), the EM algorithm is used to obtain good starting values for a subsequent efficient full information maximum likelihood (FIML) procedure.====Based on the parameter estimates, I use the life cycle model to simulate scenarios where health shocks either occur according to the estimated health process, or do not occur at all, or occur at a certain age and are persistent (no transition back to good health). A comparison of these simulations suggests that health shocks induce average losses in annual consumption of about 10% and account for more than two-thirds of the cases of old-age poverty. Both average losses in consumption and changes in the risk of old-age poverty depend substantially on initial endowments. Average losses in consumption are severe if a persistent health shock occurs at an early stage in the life cycle. The simulation of the introduction of different levels of minimum pension benefits indicates only a small decrease in average lifetime employment and no decrease in average retirement age if the minimum benefits are means-tested. For a non-means-tested scheme, the simulations suggest a severe moral hazard problem for low productivity types. A robustness check suggests that annuity markets that account for differences in the longevity risk by health status can effectively reduce the consumption risks, but only slightly decrease health-related old-age poverty.====The paper is structured as follows. I begin with an outline of the life cycle model. Then, I proceed with a description of the data before discussing the estimation approach, the parameter estimates and model fit. The following section presents the policy analysis on the health-related consumption and poverty risks and the counterfactual reforms. Subsequently, I investigate the robustness of the results. A final section sums up the main findings of the analysis.",Health-related life cycle risks and public insurance,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629617306239,May 2019,2019,Research Article,310.0

The estimated long-term impacts correspond not only to biological processes, but also incorporate changes in human behavior in reaction to the shock. While a burgeoning literature focuses on identifying parental compensating or reinforcing investments (Almond and Mazumder, 2013, Adhvaryu and Nyshadham, 2016, Sievertsen and Wüst, 2017, Bharadwaj et al., 2018), children may also respond to early life physical health insults by making different educational and occupational choices themselves, in childhood as well as adulthood. Moreover, as most studies examine shocks that impact early childhood well-being on multiple margins (e.g., both physical health and cognitive development), there is less knowledge about whether individuals’ behaviors may correspond to shifts in the relative or comparative advantage ==== various inputs into the human capital production function (Cunha and Heckman, 2007, Cunha et al., 2010, Heckman and Mosso, 2014) and the labor market.====This paper focuses on a substantial shock to childhood physical health but ==== cognitive development: paralytic poliomyelitis (hereafter, paralytic polio). Our empirical setting is the 1952 polio epidemic in Denmark's capital Copenhagen and the surrounding Copenhagen medical district. We merge unique historical medical records on the universe of children hospitalized for polio during the epidemic in this area to the 1970 Census and 1980–2013 administrative population register data. We follow childhood polio survivors as they become adults and into older ages, and study their choices regarding education and occupation. We test whether the adversity of childhood physical disability can be mediated by educational investments and occupational sorting that reflect an increase in affected individuals’ comparative advantage in cognitive relative to physical ability.====Our empirical approach compares the long-term outcomes of children who were hospitalized for either paralytic or non-paralytic polio. Paralytic polio patients experience paralysis of varying degrees, ranging from muscle weakness in an extremity to paralysis of trunk and intercostal muscles. While nearly all individuals with non-paralytic polio fully recover from the infection, paralytic polio survivors are likely to experience lasting physical disabilities even after the acute stage, including a re-occurrence of symptoms (such as muscle weakness, pain, and fatigue) after a period of stability [“post-polio syndrome,” see, e.g. Frick and Bruno, 1986, Lønnberg, 1998, Ivanyi et al., 1999, Rekand et al., 2000, Farbu et al., 2006, Tiffreau et al., 2010, Gonzalez et al., 2010, Groce et al., 2014]. Importantly, although most survivors of paralytic polio experience some permanent physical disabilities, they are still capable of continuing in mainstream education and entering the labor force after the infection. In our setting, earlier research has documented that only 25 individuals who survived paralytic polio during the 1952 epidemic ended up needing permanent respirator support, and nearly all of them were infected as adults (Warwicker, 2006). For individuals who were infected as children—on whom we focus in this study—the Danish government had an explicit goal of rehabilitation and re-integration into the regular educational system and the labor market.====Our research design relies on the assumption that, ====, the incidence of paralysis is uncorrelated with unobservable determinants of individual outcomes. A small medical literature has documented that there are few known risk factors that are associated with paralysis among polio patients (Abramson and Greenberg, 1955, Weinstein, 1957, Lindahl, 1960, Nielsen, 1999, Bunimovich-Mendrazitsky and Stone, 2005), and, as we explain in Section 4, we control for all of them in our analysis. Additionally, we show that children's socioeconomic background—an important predictor of their educational and occupational choices—is uncorrelated with the incidence of paralysis in our sample. The lack of correlation between paralysis and socioeconomic status among polio patients is consistent with earlier findings based on data from the 1952 epidemic in Lindahl (1960).====Our analysis focuses on 1649 children who were born in 1938–1952 and hospitalized for polio in the Copenhagen Blegdam hospital, the primary hospital that admitted polio cases from the capital and the rest of the Copenhagen medical district. We find that, relative to individuals hospitalized for non-paralytic polio, paralytic polio survivors are more likely to continue formal education beyond compulsory schooling and less likely to be employed as unskilled workers at ages 18 to 32. By age 50, individuals who had childhood paralytic polio are not only more likely to have a university degree, but are also in occupations that have lower task requirements in the physical/brawn domains and higher requirements for computer skills. By selecting out of manual work and into computer-intensive jobs, paralytic polio survivors end up in occupations that experienced substantial employment and wage growth over 1960–2010 (Autor et al., 2003, Deming, 2018). As a consequence, although most studies find that adverse early childhood health shocks lower individuals’ earnings in adulthood (see, e.g., Almond and Currie, 2011, Almond et al., 2018 for overviews), we do not detect any significant differences in wage earnings or total income between paralytic and non-paralytic polio survivors. At the same time, at age 50, paralytic polio survivors are more likely to be on disability pension than their non-paralytic polio counterparts. This finding highlights that the modern Danish disability insurance system plays an important role in supporting the most severely impacted polio survivors. Additionally, it suggests that the burden of the polio disease—which has been largely eradicated in developed countries—is still reflected in today's public welfare system.====While our results are consistent with paralytic polio survivors making educational and occupational choices that reflect a shift in their comparative advantage toward cognitive and away from physical skills, we acknowledge several limitations of this interpretation. Our data do not allow us to disentangle whether these effects are driven by changes in individual choices, parental investments, or public policies. Welfare coverage was gradually implemented after the epidemic, so that paralytic polio survivors and their families could apply for modest financial or in-kind support to alleviate the most pressing economic distress due to the illness. As described in Section 2, childhood polio survivors received guidance to pursue educational and occupational paths that were appropriate for their physical capabilities. At the same time, the main focus of the public support system was to integrate children into mainstream education; i.e., children infected with paralytic polio were not by default placed into special or preferential educational tracks and faced the same admissions criteria for higher education as healthy individuals.====Another issue for interpreting our results is about whether paralysis leads to such extreme loss of physical ability that survivors are unable to choose occupations requiring physical skill. If this were the case, then our findings would reflect an absolute loss of options rather than a shift in comparative advantage. Yet two sets of results suggest that comparative advantage is at least part of the story. First, as we show in Section 3, conditional on employment, paralytic polio survivors have jobs throughout the brawn skill distribution. Put differently, it is not the case that there are zero paralytic polio survivors employed in jobs with high physical skill requirements. Second, opting out of high-brawn occupations does not mechanically imply working in jobs with high computer skills requirements; it is possible to select into “low brawn, low computer skills” occupations (e.g.: telephone salespersons, bookmakers, tailors, and some legal professionals). Moreover, this occupational sorting is present even after we condition on educational attainment. We thus argue that the impact of paralytic polio on educational and occupational choices is not driven exclusively by an extreme restriction of options. And since we focus on polio survivors in the capital region of Denmark, we can rule out that differential access to educational programs is driving our results.====Selective survival among polio patients may further impact the interpretation of our findings. We show that although in-hospital mortality exclusively affected paralytic patients, it is largely uncorrelated with individual characteristics among them. Net of in-hospital mortality, paralytic polio patients are not more likely to die during childhood and young adulthood than non-paralytic patients on average. However, among patients from low socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds, those with paralytic polio are more likely to die at all observed ages than their non-paralytic counterparts.====To address the concern that selective mortality among low SES polio patients drives our long-run results on education and occupation, we perform a bounding exercise (Lee, 2009). For all individuals who are missing in our outcome data (because they are deceased or have emigrated), we impute their outcomes with the most and least favorable values of each outcome, respectively. Even if we assume that all missing individuals had the worst possible outcomes, we still find that individuals who had paralytic polio during childhood choose longer educational tracks geared toward white collar jobs early in their careers than those who had non-paralytic polio. However, when we examine educational attainment and occupation at age 50, the most conservative bounds yield insignificant estimates. Thus, it appears that initial educational and occupational decisions of paralytic polio survivors put them on a higher education track, but some of the longer-run effects on completed education and occupation may be partially driven by selective survival.====More broadly, our results suggest that paralytic polio survivors compensate for the large negative shock to their physical health by making more use of their non-brawn skills through their educational and occupational choices. Our findings echo the discussions by Yamauchi (2008) and Bleakley (2010a), who point out that if individuals make their schooling decisions based on comparing the marginal costs and benefits, educational attainment can be an uninformative measure of the welfare impact of early life health. While worse childhood health may lower the marginal productivity or the marginal benefit of schooling (which is the interpretation in studies showing adverse effects of early life health shocks on human capital attainment), it may also lower its opportunity cost since a child in poor health may have lower earnings capacity in the labor market. Consistent with this idea, prior studies from developing countries and the historical United States show that early life health can have minimal impacts on schooling despite large effects on adult income (Bleakley, 2007, Bleakley, 2010a, Bleakley, 2010b, Cutler et al., 2010, Venkataramani, 2012, Currie and Vogl, 2013).====Our innovation is to focus on adult outcomes observed in a more modern developed country and to find evidence of an ==== in educational attainment (rather than a null effect) stemming from a large shock to childhood physical health. While it is possible that this result is in part driven by paralytic polio survivors deriving higher consumption value from education than their non-paralytic counterparts, the fact that we document a shift from brawn-based occupations to those requiring skills in computers suggests that the comparative advantage explanation is also relevant.====Our evidence further builds on a small public health literature on the medium and long-term consequences of polio among survivors. Most of this research uses small samples of (selected) polio survivors, who had paralytic or non-paralytic polio, and compares their outcomes to those of never infected individuals (Lønnberg, 1993, Farbu et al., 2001, Farbu and Gilhus, 2002, Nielsen et al., 2003, Nielsen et al., 2016).==== Our study is most closely related to Nielsen et al. (2016), who find that Danish polio survivors who were infected in 1940-1954 have higher educational attainment but similar total income after age 40 when compared to a control group of never infected individuals who are matched on age and gender. We make three contributions relative to this work. First, we reduce concerns about the endogeneity of disease incidence by focusing only on individuals infected and hospitalized during the epidemic, and comparing survivors of paralytic versus non-paralytic polio. Second, we provide new evidence on the impact of paralytic polio at ==== of the life cycle, and analyze changes in the skill requirements of polio survivors’ jobs (rather than focusing on broad occupational groups, as in prior studies). Third, since the historical medical records allow us to observe family background and to identify polio patients who do not appear in our outcomes data due to death (or, possibly, emigration), we consider heterogeneity in effects by SES, and explicitly account for selective mortality with a bounding approach.","Childhood health shocks, comparative advantage, and long-term outcomes: Evidence from the last Danish polio epidemic",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629618308488,23 April 2019,2019,Research Article,311.0

Disability insurance compensates enrollees for the loss of physical and mental capacities that adversely affect labor market potentials (Staubli, 2011, Maestas et al., 2013, French and Song, 2014). Taiwan adopts comprehensive employment-based mandatory disability programs. However, the Taiwanese programs include an uncommon coverage for women's infertility due to i) hysterectomy (surgical uterus removal), ii) oophorectomy (surgical ovaries removal), and iii) radio-chemo therapy. Enrollees are entitled to a cash benefit, equal to about 5 to 6 months of salaries when they undergo these treatments, but the coverage ends at enrollees’ 45th birthday.====Organ dismemberment insurance policies are common. However, we are unaware of evidence that these policies have “caused” enrollees to lose a thumb, a toe, an eye, or get an eardrum perforated. Compensations are almost never high enough compared to the loss disutility. However, the unique Taiwanese programs afford us the rare research opportunity to examine if disability insurance has caused enrollees to have organ-removal surgeries.==== Clearly, hysterectomies and oophorectomies are performed based on illness indications, but may still be performed when severity may not justify surgery. Does disability insurance lead to excessive treatments that would not have been performed otherwise: an inducement effect? Does disability insurance lead to treatments being expedited to before the 45th birthday: a timing effect?====Only hysterectomy exhibits significant inducement and timing effects; oophorectomy does not. About 11-12% of hysterectomies in our sample can be attributed to the inducement effect, and under 20% of induced surgeries can be attributed to the timing effect. These are striking results. First, the disability coverage offers the same benefits due to hysterectomy or oophorectomy. However, oophorectomy has far more serious adverse health consequences than hysterectomy (more thorough discussions in Section 2.1). If an enrollee chose to undergo one procedure solely for the disability benefit, the preferred procedure would be the less unpleasant hysterectomy, not oophorectomy. Of course, surgeries should be justified by illness severity. Inducements separate out unjustified surgeries. And we have only found significant inducement with hysterectomy. The evidence is consistent with optimizing behavior—even when the decision involves a surgery to remove a major organ.====Second, the disability insurance implementation turns out to be very costly. The Taiwanese already have national health insurance, so surgery inducement due to disability insurance occurs in addition to moral hazard due to health insurance. Linking a disability to a surgical procedure creates double moral hazard, one in the disability claim, and another in health care use. Our results serve as a warning against using a medical treatment as a qualification for disability benefits.====Third, this study sheds some light on monetary incentives and human organs in general. Our evidence suggests that individuals make consistent choices. The lack of inducement and timing effects in oophorectomy perhaps is the strongest evidence that for a given price of an organ, individuals reject the offer if and only if the disutility is sufficiently high. We have also found that, in the income-stratified samples, induced-hysterectomy rates are increasing in the benefit levels.====We estimate the inducement and timing effects by difference-in-difference and bunching-smoothing polynomial methods. The difference-in-difference design is based on the comparison of enrollees in three disability insurance programs and those uninsured between 1997 and 2011. The three programs are Labor Insurance, Government Employee Insurance, and Farmer Insurance. The uninsured are mostly women who are inactive in the labor force. Our data are from Taiwan's National Health Insurance. In addition, we use the Survey of Family Income and Expenditure (SFIE) to control for socio-demographic and economic factors.====We follow women for 11 years, between their 39th and 50th birthdays. In the main analysis, we include only enrollees who have not changed their insurance programs in the sample years. We then group enrollees by their birth cohorts and insurance programs, and calculate the hysterectomy and oophorectomy hazards for quarters (a 91-day period) before and after the 45th birthday. For each birth cohort, we also use the average numbers of children and sons, marital status, and household income as covariates.====Our difference-in-difference design is unconventional because there is not a policy change, so no before-and-after regimes. However, the insured lose the infertility disability benefit at age 45. Obviously, the benefit expiration is irrelevant to the uninsured. Our assumption is that the disability insurance effect is muted when the enrollees are young. This is because most uterine problems occur past late thirties, so surgeries to qualify for benefits are infeasible until enrollees become older. To operationalize our empirical strategy, we let the disability benefit become a relevant policy intervention when enrollees turn 40 years old. We have chosen to be cautious: if the deadline had become relevant before the 40th birthday, our assumption would have yielded difference estimates smaller than the actual differences.====We examine quarter-by-quarter hazard differences between the insured and uninsured, for 20 quarters before and after expiration. For hysterectomy, Labor Insurance and Government Employee Insurance enrollees’ hazards begin to rise rapidly 8 quarters before expiration, but drop rapidly for 2 quarters after. Enrollees in Farmer Insurance show similar but less pronounced hazard changes. For oophorectomy, these rapid changes are absent in all insurance programs.====From the estimates we calculate inducement and timing effects. The inducement effect is the total number of insured enrollees’ extra surgeries between their 40th and 50th birthdays compared to the uninsured. The timing effect consists of the total number of surgeries that the insured would have undergone after the 45th birthday compared to the uninsured. In our sample, Labor Insurance enrollees have a total of 43,845 hysterectomies, and the inducement effect is 5,076 hysterectomies, or about 11.6%. For Government Employee Insurance, the total is 7,262, and the inducement effect is 789, or 10.9%; the timing effect is about 20% of inducement. For Farmer Insurance, the total is 9,100, and the inducement effect is 347, or 3.8%. No inducement or timing effects have been found for oophorectomy.====We also use a bunching-smoothing polynomial estimation (see e.g. Saez, 2010, Chetty et al., 2011), which assumes that surgeries do not happen abruptly over time. We use hazards in benefit quarters far from the 45th birthday to fit a polynomial. Then we use the fitted polynomial to predict the hazards in benefit quarters near the 45th birthday. Any discrepancy between predicted and actual hazards is attributed to disability insurance. Inducement and timing effects are defined analogously. Bunching-smoothing polynomial estimation yields inducement and timing effects similar to those in the difference-in-difference method.====As a falsification check, we estimate inducement and timing effects of partial oophorectomy (the removal of one ovary), and myomectomy (the removal of the inner lining of the uterus). These procedures are used to alleviate problems in the female reproductive system, but do not qualify for the infertility disability benefit. We have found no inducement or timing effects for these procedures.====We also consider a number of robustness issues and policy implications. Our primary sample consists of female enrollees who have not switched insurance programs. For a larger sample, we include those who have switched between programs. Next, enrollees in the main sample are women aged between 39 and 49 years old during the period 1997 to 2011. Early cohorts are subject to left censoring; late cohorts, right censoring. For a smaller sample, we only use data from those with uncensored medical records in the sample period. We show that our results are robust.====We estimate benefit payments and surgery costs induced by disability insurance. We estimate that on average, the increase in benefit payment is about NT$1,410 or US$47 (the exchange rate is US$1 for NT$30 in 2015) per enrollee, and the hysterectomy cost is about NT$400 per enrollee. For comparison, the reimbursement rate for mammogram and pap smear are, respectively, NT$1,245 and NT$80. Hence, the inducement cost is more than enough to pay for 1 mammogram and 5 pap smears for each enrollee.====Age-based insurance benefits are quite common. Medicare in the United States provides health insurance to individuals above 65. Research has shown that patients delay treatment or surgeries until they become eligible for Medicare (see McWilliams et al., 2003, McWilliams et al., 2007, Card et al., 2008, Card et al., 2009). The spike in hysterectomies for insured Taiwanese just before age 45 is consistent with results in the existing literature, but oophorectomies do not exhibit such a spike.====Our empirical strategies use a modified difference-in-difference regression and a bunching-smoothing polynomial estimation. Difference-in-difference regression is standard for policy evaluations (see Imbens and Wooldridge, 2009). Here, we study quarter-by-quarter policy effects, as in Chandra et al. (2010). Autor et al. (2007) use a similar year-by-year difference-in-difference model to understand how mandated employment protections reduce productive efficiency. Hoynes et al. (2015) also use the same method to study how earned income tax credit influences infant health outcomes.====Our bunching-smoothing polynomial estimation is similar to the method for assessing policy discontinuity effects. For example, taxes can be discontinuously related to reported incomes (Saez, 2010, Chetty et al., 2011, Kleven and Waseem, 2013), tax reliefs may be available to couples only if marriages or child births happen before a deadline (Persson, 2015), or students’ test scores bump up over key grade cutoffs in nationwide math tests, and teachers use discretion in their grading to achieve the discrete jumps (Diamond and Persson, 2016). We use the standard assumption that, absent the policy, the variable of interest should change smoothly. Our method is more closely related to Diamond and Persson (2016) in that we use minimum mean-squared errors to determine the manipulated regions and then estimate the counterfactual surgery polynomials. In addition, we are interested in assessing the enrollees’ overall responses and their timing, so implementing a regression discontinuity design is inappropriate.====We present the study background in Section 2. Section 3 describes the data, the samples of enrollees, and sample statistics. In Section 4, we present the two econometric methods. Section 4.1 is on the difference-in-difference method, and Section 4.2 is on the bunching-smoothing polynomial method. Two subsections in Section 5 present estimation results. In Section 6, we consider bigger and smaller samples according to program-switching and censoring criteria. Next, we stratify Labor Insurance enrollees according to five benefit levels, to examine inducement variations. Finally, we present inducement social cost estimates. We draw some conclusions in Section 7.

Social schedules can conflict with individual circadian rhythms, the physiological processes (physical, mental and behavioral) characterized by a 24-hour cycle affecting sleep-wake-cycles and other physiological functions (e.g., hormone release, body temperature). Chronobiologists refer to the discrepancy arising between biological and social time as “social jetlag” (Roenneberg et al., 2012). The goal of this paper is to analyze the causal effects of social jetlag on health and economic outcomes exploiting the quasi-experiment provided by the variation in the timing of natural light introduced by time zone borders.====The allocation of time between work, home-production, leisure and rest has been a central question in the economic literature (Becker, 1965, Gronau, 1977, Aguiar and Hurst, 2007, Aguiar et al., 2013). Working schedules, school start times, and generally the organization of social time are subject to growing economic incentives for coordination and synchronization (Weiss, 1996, Stein and Daude, 2007, Hamermesh et al., 2008). However, the “forced synchornization” of schedules can disrupt human circadian rhythms and have detrimental effects on health and productivity (Cappuccio et al., 2010). Economists have largely neglected the possible detrimental effects of “forced synchronization” of time-use on health and economic productivity (Mullainathan, 2014). Motivated by the growing medical awareness on the undermining effects of circadian rhythms disruption, our goal is to assess how the forced synchronization imposed by time zones and the rigidity of social schedules affect health and economic performance.====As all mammals, humans respond to environmental light, the most important signal regulating our biological clock. However, human beings are the only animal species that deliberately tries to master nature, for instance depriving themselves of sleep. Individuals adjust their schedules responding to incentives to economic and social coordination. The inability to master the biological responses of our body gives rise to the health and human capital effects we estimate in this study. The timing of natural light is determined by the existence of time zones and has a direct effect on the sleep-wake cycle. The human body reacts to environmental light, producing more melatonin when it becomes darker.==== The misalignment of sleep and wake rhythms with the daily cycle of physiological processes desynchronizes the release of hormones such as melatonin, cortisol (“the stress hormone”), ghrelin (the “hunger hormone”) and leptin (the “satiety hormone”). As these hormones are related to stress, metabolism and inflammation, circadian rhythms disruptions can directly affect health by increasing the risk of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, and cancer progression (Luyster et al., 2012). Medical studies provide evidence of important associations of exposure to artificial and natural light at night with sleep loss, weight gain, cognitive impairment and chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes (Shi et al., 2013, Schmidt et al., 2007). There is also observational evidence on shift workers and experimental evidence on rats suggesting that circadian rhythms disruption increases the risk of certain types of cancer (Haus and Smolensky, 2013, Blask et al., 2005). However, most of the evidence is based on descriptive studies or laboratory experiments. Observational studies do not shed light on the mechanisms underlying these associations, while laboratory experiments provide a limited understanding of the effects of circadian rhythms disruptions in the real-world (Roenneberg, 2013). Furthermore, they do not allow us to understand how individual behaviors are affected by social constructs such as work schedules, school start times, and other forms of “forced synchronization”.====Our main contribution is to provide a causal estimate of the health and economic effects of social jetlag using non-experimental data. Time zones allow us to identify an exogenous variation in the timing of natural light. In counties lying on the eastern (right) side of a time zone boundary, sunset time occurs an hour later than in nearby counties on the opposite side of the boundary (see Fig. 1). More generally the onset of daylight is delayed by an hour. Henceforth, we will refer to these counties as counties on the late sunset side of the border. Because of the delayed onset of daylight and the biological link between environmental light and the production of melatonin throughout the day, individuals on the late sunset side of a time zone boundary will tend to go to bed at a later time. In addition, as prime-time evening shows air at 10 p.m. Eastern and Pacific, 9 p.m. Central and Mountain, TV programs may also affect bedtime and reduce or reinforce the effect of sunset time (Hamermesh et al., 2008). Note that if people were to compensate by waking up later, solar, and TV cues would have no effect on sleep duration. However, because of economic incentives, social schedules — such as working schedules, and school start times — tend to be rigid and unresponsive to solar cues. Thus, many individuals are not able to fully compensate in the morning by waking up at a later time.====Given the direct biological link between the dark-light and the sleep-wake cycle, sleep is our primary outcome of interest. Sleep is a commodity we all demand. Yet, statistics suggest many of us sleep less than the recommended 7–8 h.==== A survey conducted in 2013 by the U.S. National Sleep Foundation found that Americans are more sleep-starved than their peers abroad, and the Institute of Medicine (2006) estimates that 50-70 million US adults have sleep or wakefulness disorder (Altevogt et al., 2006). Estimates suggest that in many countries, individuals are sleeping as much as two hours less per night than did their ancestors one hundred years ago and that the “unnatural” timing of sleep may be the “most prevalent high-risk behavior in modern society” (Roenneberg, 2013). Biddle and Hamermesh (1990) were the first to formalize the analysis of the sleeping decision and econometrically analyze its relationship with economic incentives.==== Despite the large heterogeneity in sleep duration in the population and the growing medical evidence on the risks associated with short sleep duration and poor sleep quality, only recently economists have attempted to empirically analyze the economic causes and consequences of sleep deprivation.====Using data from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS), we find that employed people living in counties on the late sunset side of the time zone border sleep on average 19 fewer minutes than employed people living in neighboring counties on the opposite side of the border because of the one-hour difference in sunset time. More generally, individuals on the late sunset side of a time zone boundary are more likely to be sleep deprived, more likely to sleep less than 6 hours, and less likely to sleep at least 8 hours. The effects are larger among individuals with early working schedules and among individuals with children of school age. These results are confirmed using an alternative metric of sleep deprivation drawn from the Behavioral Risk Factor and Surveillance Survey (BRFSS). Reassuringly the trend in sleep duration metrics across the border mirrors the linear (mechanical) trend in the timing of sunset across the time zone boundary. Using health information available at the county-level (source: Centers for Disease Prevention and Control, CDC), we also find evidence of significant discontinuities in the incidence of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and breast cancer. Summarizing these outcomes with a standardized composite health index, we find that living on the late sunset side of the border decreases the index by .3 standard deviations. These effects are the consequences of a long-term-exposure to circadian rhythms disruptions.====There are several biological channels through which the discontinuity in sunset time at the time-zone border may affect these health outcomes. First, the reduction in sleep duration has been associated with the release of hormones that are correlated with weight gain and with inflammations associated with cardiovascular diseases and certain types of cancer. The delay of natural light may also have direct effects on physical activity and on eating behaviors.==== In the Appendix, we exploit time use data to analyze the role of these alternative mechanisms. Our findings rule out the hypothesis that changes in physical activity may explain the observed discontinuities in health outcomes. However, we do find evidence that individuals exposed to more sunlight in the evening tend to eat later and are more likely to dine-out. These effects contribute to explaining the detrimental impact of social jetlag on obesity and, in turn, diabetes.====To gauge an idea about potential costs of circadian rhythms disruptions we provide a back of the envelope estimate of health care costs and productivity losses associated with the discontinuity in the sunlight onset occurring at the border of a time zone. We calculate that the circadian misalignment increases health care costs by at least 2 billion dollars. Productivity losses associated with the insufficient sleep induced by the extra hour of light in the evening are equivalent to 4.40 million days of work.====Having shown that the delay of natural light onset has significant effects on health outcomes, we turn to the analysis of its possible effects on economic productivity. To this goal we test for the presence of discontinuities in zip code-level income per capita as a measure of economic productivity. Using zip code level data from the 2010–2014 American Community Survey, we show that within commuting zones spanning across a time-zone boundary – where mobility costs should be low and arbitrage should eliminate any wage differential – there are not significant differences in income per capita across the border. However, as we exclude from the analysis counties in commuting zones spanning across the time zone boundary, we do find evidence that wages tend to be 3% lower on the late sunset side of the time zone border. These are long-run effects as they capture cross-sectional differences in the exposure to a delay in the onset of sunset time. Despite these differences, we find no evidence of residential sorting. In particular, there is no significant discontinuity in home values, rents, and commuting times. Nor we find evidence of discontinuity in population density at the time zone border. Persistent differences across commuting zones are consistent with recent evidence against the full mobility benchmark (Autor et al., 2013, Bartik, 2017, Amior and Manning, 2015). There are also other potential explanations for why individuals on the late sunset side of the border would not move or adjust their schedules. More light in the evening may have negative effects on health and income, but it may increase the marginal utility from leisure time generating a trade-off between health and leisure enjoyment. Finally, individuals may have inaccurate self-perceptions of their biological needs and may underestimate the detrimental effects of circadian rhythms disruption on health. Time inconsistency, bounded rationality, cognitive impediments, self-serving bias may explain individual sub-optimal behavior (Mani et al., 2013, Banerjee and Mullainathan, 2008).====Taken together, our findings highlight that while schedules’ synchronization may respond to economic incentives to coordination, the conflict arising between our biological and social schedule may result in non-negligible costs because of the negative effects of social jetlag on health and economic productivity.====Our results are robust to a large battery of robustness checks. First, we show that there are no discontinuities in our covariates and in predetermined characteristics known not to be affected by the treatment. Second, we find no significant relationship with outcomes that should not be affected by circadian rhythms disruption (e.g., cancer types that are mostly determined by genetic inheritance). Furthermore, our results are robust to the bandwidth choice, to the inclusion of state-fixed effects and the adoption of alternative estimation procedures that takes into account the methodological challenges that typically arise in a geographic RD design (Imbens and Zajonc, 2011).====This research contributes to a small but growing number of studies in the economic literature analyzing the health effects of sleep deprivation, and more generally, the effects of circadian rhythms disruptions. In a recent study, Jin et al. (2015) study the health effects of Daylight Saving Time (DST) and find that health slightly improves in the short run (4 days) when clocks are set back by one hour in Fall but no evidence of detrimental effects when moving from standard time to DST in Spring. Using a similar strategy, Smith (2016) shows that DST increases fatal crashes, while Doleac and Sanders (2015) provide evidence of a 7% decrease in robberies following the shift to DST, and the relative change in the timing of daylight. We differentiate from Jin et al. (2015), as rather than focusing on the short-run effects of the shift to DST, we examine the long-run effects of exposure to light in the evening on measures of health and chronic diseases that are less likely to vary in the short-run (e.g., obesity, diabetes etc.). Our paper is related to Gibson and Shrader (2018) who use within-time zone variation in sunset time to identify the effects of sleep on wages. They find that a one-hour increase in average daily sleep increases productivity to a greater extent than does a one-year increase in education. However, we take a different econometric approach exploiting the discontinuity at the time zone border rather than the variation in sunset time within a time zone border. We argue that this mitigates the concern that differences in sunset time within a time-zone may be correlated with unobservable determinants of health and human capital as counties in proximity of the border may be more similar to each other than counties on the two edges of the same timezone (e.g., coastal vs internal cities). Furthermore, we shed further light on the mechanisms of the reduced-form effect of exposure to later light in the evening on economic outcomes by focusing on a battery of health metrics that may have a direct impact on economic productivity and health care costs. Finally, this paper is also related to the studies analyzing the effects of school start times on academic achievement (Carrell et al., 2011, Edwards, 2012, Dills and Hernandez-Julian, 2008) and showing that even small differences in school start times can have large effects on academic outcomes. In particular, our design is similar to Heissel and Norris (2017) who use the time zone boundary in Florida to instrument for the hours of sunlight before school and show that moving start times one hour later relative to sunrise increases test scores. However, none of these papers exploits the sharp discontinuity at time zone borders to analyze the medium and long-run effects of circadian rhythms disruptions on health and economic outcomes.====This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we briefly discuss the context. Section 3 describes the data and our identification strategy. Section 4 discusses the main results documenting the discontinuities in sleep, health, and economic outcomes. Robustness checks are discussed in Section 5. In the Appendix, we explore the potential mechanisms explaining the effects on health and productivity.

We use administrative data from a Dutch private ","In the past decades many Western countries have seen a rise in uptake of disability benefits (OECD, 2010). In an effort to curb this trend, there has been an increased focus on what disabled individuals can do at work, rather than what they cannot. For example, in England sick notes have been replaced by a statement of fitness for work in 2010 (Wainwright et al., 2011), in Sweden general practitioners are recommended to subscribe part-time sick leave rather than full time sick leave (Kausto et al., 2008) and in Norway sick-listed employees are since 2004 required to work partially after 8 weeks of sick leave unless a physician has stated this is impossible (Hernæs, 2017). In a similar vein, part-time sick leave is often used as a workplace based intervention aimed at speeding up the rehabilitation process of sick-listed employees. In these interventions usually the amount of hours worked gradually increases over time, up to the moment that full work resumption is achieved. The idea is that graded work prevents the loss of working skills and may even speed up the recovery from certain injuries. For instance, Andren and Svensson (2012) argue that particularly individuals with musculo-skeletal problems benefit from graded work activities. Likewise, ==== (IPS) interventions for sick workers with mental impairments are built upon the idea that work activities may contribute to the recovery process.====Research shows almost unanimously positive effects of graded work on work rehabilitation,==== whereas interventions like vocational rehabilitation and regular paramedical care rather seem to lengthen sick spells (Markussen and Røed, 2014, Rehwald et al., 2018). This however does not mean that graded return-to-work is beneficial for all individuals (Andren and Svensson, 2012, Andren, 2014, Høgelund et al., 2012). Starting graded work trajectories too soon or for too many hours may induce stress or strain on the body, hampering the recovery process. In light of these considerations, it is important to understand what separates an effective graded return-to-work trajectory from an ineffective one.====In this paper we analyze how the set-up of a graded return-to-work trajectory determines its effectiveness. More specifically, we analyze if work resumption rates change when the trajectory is started at a higher initial rate of work resumption or if it is starter later. For this we make use of registered data from a private workplace reintegration provider, which performs case management for mostly small and medium sized firms. This provider offered reintegration services for about 12,000 long-term sick listed workers, of which 62% participated in graded work trajectories between the years 2011 and 2014. We observe detailed worker information on the timing and the degree of grading that is used, as well as information on impairment types, employer, and other individual characteristics. We enrich these data with information on the case managers that were assigned to them by the workplace reintegration provider.====In order to correct for the selection bias inherent to the evaluation of activation strategies, we follow an instrumental variables approach for which we exploit the discretionary room of the case managers in setting up treatment plans. We use the tendency of a case manager to focus on graded work (i.e., the ‘graded work propensity’) as an instrument to actually receiving such a strategy. In doing so, we follow a strand of literature applying this technique in the context of activation strategies for sick-listed employees, such as Dean et al. (2015), Markussen and Røed (2014) and Rehwald et al. (2018).==== As case managers may learn on the job or change their preference for graded work, we allow graded work propensities to vary across years. Our key assumption is that the assignment of (new) sick-listed workers to case managers is exogenous. We argue that this assumption is plausible, as the assignment is driven by the direct availability of case managers. All the individual information on new sick-listed workers that is available to the case managers at the moment of intake is included in our data. This means that any selection on observables can be controlled for.====Our analysis extends on earlier studies in this field of research by also using a propensity measure for the initial degree of grading. In line with earlier work, we will first define case managers’ propensity measures as the likelihood of initiating a trajectory for sick-listed workers that have not started one yet. We next construct a propensity score measure for the initial graded work percentage that is applied. This then enables us to evaluate the effects of differences in the degree of grading interventions on work resumption. As both propensities for the frequency and the degree of grading are correlated, we also estimate a model for work resumption with both the grading tendency and the degree of grading as explanatories. As such, we can analyze whether different dimensions of grading are interrelated and isolate their effects on work resumption. In addition, we shed new light on the determinants of graded work propensities and the implications of this for the interpretation of our findings. Even though the case managers’ tendencies to use graded work interventions are plausibly exogenous, we cannot be sure that they are uncorrelated with other case manager characteristics affecting the likelihood of work resumption. We therefore conduct sensitivity tests with proxies for case manager quality as additional controls, including past work resumption rates of other sick-listed workers that were assigned to the case manager and work resumption rates of sick-listed workers that are out of sample.====We find that graded return-to-work has the potential to speed up the recovery process, but does not necessarily help rehabilitate individuals who would otherwise have not rehabilitated. Graded work that is initiated in the first 26 weeks of absence yields an increase of 18 weeks in the number of weeks worked during the first two years after sick-listing, but has no significant effects on the probability to return to work within two years. Starting a graded return-to-work trajectory at a work resumption rate which is 10 percentage point higher increases the probability to return to work within 2 years with four percentage point. This suggests that a sufficiently high degree of grading is crucial to realize work resumption levels that are permanent. Finally, the positive effects of graded return-to-work are especially strong and persistent for individuals who have general medical conditions. For individuals with problems related to mental health we find no significant overall effects of graded return-to-work.====In the following section, we explain the system of sick leave and disability insurance in the Netherlands. Then, in Section 3 we provide descriptive statistics on the sick-listed individuals in the data set, the graded return-to-work trajectories, and the case managers. In Section 4, we explain our empirical strategy and underlying assumptions.

Data from DCEs are potentially subject to hypothetical bias. In turn, forecasts may be biased, yielding substandard evidence for policymakers. Bias can enter both through the elasticities as well as through the model constants. Simple correction approaches exist (using revealed preference data) but are seemingly not widely used in health economics. We use DCE data from an experiment on smokers in the US. Real-world data are used to calibrate the scale of utility (in two ways) and the alternative-specific constants (ASCs); several innovations for calibration are proposed. We find that embedding revealed preference data in the model makes a substantial difference to the forecasts; and that how models are calibrated also makes a substantial difference.","Discrete choice models are used extensively in health economics, with a major focus on the use of data from experiments in surveys, variably referred to as stated preference (SP), stated choice (SC) or discrete choice experiments (DCE), in contrast to the Revealed Preference (RP) data sources for which choice modelling was initially developed (see Louviere and Lancsar, 2009; de Bekker-Grob et al., 2012; Clark et al., 2014; Soekhai et al., 2018, for backgrounds in the use of choice modelling in health). The models estimated on such data provide insights into the relative importance of different product or service characteristics in determining the choice of an individual decision-maker. After estimation, it is straightforward to use these choice models in forecasting, i.e. predicting the demand for services and/or the changes in demand as a result of changes in the population of decision-makers and/or the characteristics of the products/services.====Forecasts of this type can be extremely valuable to policymakers. While generating forecasts from models estimated on SP data is a straightforward process, the reliability of SP-based forecasts is not guaranteed. The main objection to SP data is hypothetical bias (Hausman, 2012). That is, what people say they will do and what people actually do can be very different. This can, in some cases, lead to specious forecasts lacking external validity. Policymaking based on these estimates is therefore at risk to this extent. As such, this is one of the most important, if not the most important, issues concerning forecasts derived from choice models estimated on hypothetical data.====The impact of hypothetical bias in SP data has been studied widely in contingent valuation (CV) studies, where it is thought that individuals typically overstate willingness to pay (List and Gallet, 2001; Little and Berrens, 2004; Murphy et al., 2005; Whynes et al., 2005; Donfouet et al., 2013). In the DCE setting, there are fewer examples, owing to the relative difficulty and cost of conducting such studies (Fifer et al., 2014). In terms of attributes, the extant evidence suggests that hypothetical bias plays a role, but its effect on the direction of preference estimates varies (Fifer et al., 2014; Beck et al., 2016; Rakotonarivo et al., 2016). In the health setting, one study found that WTP from DCEs was higher than that of CV (Ryan and Watson, 2008). Elsewhere, Özdemir et al. (2009) find that the use of “cheap talk” (i.e. instructing respondents of the importance of their responses in an attempt to elicit truthful responses) reduces estimates of WTP (versus no use of cheap talk); interpreting this as having reduced hypothetical bias. This is broadly consistent with findings in the wider DCE literature (Beck et al., 2016). However, it is not clear that cheap talk can eradicate hypothetical bias entirely; indeed, methods of this ilk are not generalizable, proven remedies for hypothetical bias (Harrison, 2014; Wuepper et al., 2018).====The type of bias discussed above related to the possibility that the way in which respondents react differently to attributes in a hypothetical setting compared to a real-world setting varies across attributes, leading to differences in WTP. In addition, there is the possibility of respondents reacting more or less strongly overall to the stimuli they are faced with in a hypothetical setting. This is in line with earlier work showing that, in terms of product preferences, respondents in DCEs are thought to overstate their propensity to purchase products, so market shares may be biased (Train, 2009). A literature review of predictions versus choices in health DCEs suggests that there is reasonable concordance between predicted and actual choices (Quaife et al., 2018). The remaining error, however, suggests that hypothetical bias is at play. Thus, the evidence suggests that hypothetical bias in SP-based DCEs impacts on estimates of both the attribute and product preferences.====Choice modelling is multidisciplinary, and it is useful to reflect on the views held in other disciplines. One of the more established fields of choice modelling research is transportation, where the general perception is that data from hypothetical surveys are useful for understanding relative sensitivities of decision makers, e.g. how important is price as a characteristic compared to waiting time, but is potentially subject to severe bias in terms of the absolute sensitivities (Train, 2009; Hess and Daly, 2014). While commonly done in consulting work, very few academic studies in transport would use hypothetical data for forecasting, especially without additional corrections such as discussed in the present paper. In particular, the general perception is that, when answering hypothetical choice tasks (as in SP data), decision makers face these choices in a highly isolated setting (in contrast with their real-world decision-making, as in RP data, where numerous outside factors are at play) and may thus overstate their reaction to changes in those variables included in a survey (Harrison, 2014; Hensher et al., 2015). If this is the case, then parameters, and derived elasticities from those parameters, in models estimated on hypothetical data are likely to be overstated, leading to biased forecasts, and in particular an overstated impact of interventions. It is the scale of utility==== which reflects the degree of randomness in behavior in the choice model – if the elasticities in SP data are biased upwards, then the scale in SP data will be higher than the RP scale.====Another possible source of bias arises when the market shares for the different options in a dataset used for modelling are different from overall real-world shares. This issue can arise with RP data, as a result of the sample of decision makers not being representative of the overall population, but is especially prevalent in hypothetical data. Indeed, not only does the same possibility of a non-representative sample arise (which may be intentional if targeting specific population subsets), but the way in which the alternatives are described in the survey may influence the shares obtained in the survey. It is the product constants in the choice model (commonly termed alternative-specific constants (ASCs)) through which this form of bias arises, driven directly by the market shares in the estimation data.====Both types of bias can potentially be addressed with a mix of different RP-based methods, but these have received relatively little exposure in health economics. This paper gives an overview of these corrections, scale calibration and ASC calibration, and illustrates their impacts in the case of a typical stated choice survey in health. We provide several innovations that are useful to researchers in the field. First, we combine both scale and ASC calibration, and compare results to uncalibrated forecasts and forecasts that calibrate either feature. Second, we compare two approaches to calibrating the scale of utility – one is using joint SP-RP modeling, and another is scale calibration based on elasticity measures in the literature. Third, we propose a novel, simple technique for calibrating model constants, that we term ====, which allows for ambiguity in the interpretation of the outside good==== (also referred to as the “opt-out” option). We show not only that these methods can have a profound effect on forecasts, but also that how these methods are applied can have a significant impact, too. This is important for those who are making predictions to inform policymaking.====We use a choice experiment on US adult smokers and recent quitters (Buckell et al., 2018). The application to tobacco enables us to use several sources of RP data: product use and purchasing data from individuals that took the experiment, RP data from the literature (Pesko et al., 2018) and Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) – a large, nationally-collected tobacco use data set (Hyland et al., 2017). Use of these data allows for the alternative approaches to calibration, insights into the mechanisms of calibration, and an ensuing discussion as to which is more appropriate for the task at hand. Further, tobacco regulation is an area in which policy predictions are of significant value and have been made in several recent studies (Kenkel et al., 2017; Buckell et al., 2018; Marti et al., 2019). Therefore, understanding the precision of forecasts is critical for generating high quality evidence for policymaking. In addition, this example highlights the importance of calibration, as follows. In principle, hypothetical bias should not pervade tobacco DCEs in the same way as other health applications. That is, in this setting, the options are realistic, the products are familiar to respondents and the products are well-described by their attributes; all of which are conducive to the DCE functioning as intended (McFadden, 2014). Thus, the impact of RP calibration here should be smaller than for other applications. We show that, even in this setting, model calibration makes a significant impact on forecasts.",Stubbing out hypothetical bias: improving tobacco market predictions by combining stated and revealed preference data,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629618306179,May 2019,2019,Research Article,315.0

First, I use a reform of the statutory retirement age in an IV design. Second, I use a large discontinuity in retirement take-up at the earliest age of retirement (60) in a ","The world population is aging. In the next 40 years, the total share of the population aged 60 or older is expected to rise from around 10% of the global population to 22% of the global population (Bloom et al., 2015). In Denmark, this ratio is expected to reach 30% by 2053 (Statistics Denmark, 2017). For governments and policymakers alike, population aging is a cause for concern due to the inherent social and economic challenges it brings. To alleviate the fiscal burden of aging populations, policies seek to increase employment amongst the oldest, for example by incentivizing delayed retirement or changing statutory retirement ages (Whiteford and Whitehouse, 2006). These policy changes have direct effects on government budgets through increases in tax payments and decreases in government transfers. However, retirement alterations may also influence the health of individuals and therefore impact fiscal spending. If retirement has any effects on health, these effects, both fiscal and in terms of individual well-being, should be taken into account in the evaluation of retirement reforms. This paper sheds light on this important issue by examining the causal effect of retirement on health and healthcare utilization.====A large and growing body of empirical research has investigated the effects of retirement on health. However, in spite of the growing attention, there is still no consensus on the sign or size of these effects. The fundamental empirical challenge is reverse causality: we seek to estimate the link going from retirement to health but individual health may affect the decision to retire. The first contribution of this paper is to provide new evidence on the causal effect of retirement on health and healthcare utilization.====The second contribution of this paper is to shed light on the degree of heterogeneity with respect to age of retirement, measure of health and observable characteristics. To this end, I apply two distinct empirical strategies and exploit detailed administrative data to explore heterogeneity with respect to observable characteristics. The third contribution of this paper is to distinguish between the effects on physical health (mortality and comorbidities) and healthcare utilization (hospitalizations and GP visits). This distinction turns out to be empirically relevant.====To identify the causal effect of retirement on health, I use both a reform affecting retirement at relatively old ages (65/67) and a large discontinuity in retirement take-up at age 60. The first strategy exploits an exogenous change in the Danish Old Age Pension (OAP) age following a retirement reform enacted in 1999. One part of the reform was a change of the minimum OAP age from age 67 to 65. The change only affected individuals born on or after July 1st 1939, providing an opportunity to use individuals born just before the threshold as a natural control group. Hereafter, I will refer to this strategy as the reform strategy. The second identification strategy utilizes a large jump in retirement take-up at age 60, caused by the Danish Early Retirement Pension (ERP), to identify the causal effect of retirement on health in a regression discontinuity design. I will refer to this strategy as the RD strategy.====The reform strategy displays no effect of old age retirement on health or healthcare utilization. In the RD strategy, I find no effect of retirement on health, but small negative effects on healthcare utilization in the short run. Specifically, early retirement leads to a drop in the number of GP visits and in the risk of being hospitalized corresponding to 8–10% of mean utilization. I argue that the results from the reform strategy are different from the RD strategy, because the former investigates retirement at a late age (65/67) while the latter examines retirement at an early age (60). The heterogeneity analysis shows that the drop in GP visits is fully driven by a drop in female GP utilization, whereas both men and women experience a decline in hospitalizations post early retirement. The degree of heterogeneity with respect to other predetermined characteristics is otherwise modest.====This study relates to a number of existing studies investigating the effect of retirement on health. Although the majority of studies lean towards finding positive effects of retirement, the literature is generally inconclusive. As such, seemingly similar papers find both positive and negative effects on health. For example, zooming in on papers exploiting political reforms for identification, the literature has shown both positive (Ori, 2018, Bloemen et al., 2017, Hallberg et al., 2015, Atalay et al., 2014, Hernaes et al., 2013, Bingley et al., 2011), zero (Hagen, 2017) and negative effects of retirement (Kuhn et al., 2015). A similar pattern emerges for papers using regression discontinuity designs or cross-country data, where some studies (Grøtting et al., 2017, Fé et al., 2016, Eibich, 2015, Johnston et al., 2009, Coe et al., 2011) find positive or zero effects of retirement and others (Fitzpatrick et al., 2018, Zhang et al., 2018, Godard, 2016, Heller-Sahlgren, 2017, Mazzonna et al., 2017)==== find negative effects. The sources behind the discrepancy in the literature are uncertain, but differences in empirical methods, operationalization of health or study population are potential explanations. Nishimura et al. (2017) use global aging data to examine the role of empirical methods in explaining the disparity across studies. They conclude that retirement often has positive effects on health and that variation in empirical methods play a key role in explaining the differences in the literature. In this paper, I provide important insights into the ambiguous literature by examining the causal effect of retirement on objective measures of both health and healthcare utilization and by examining heterogeneity in terms of observables and age of retirement - all on the same underlying population.====This paper proceeds as follows. In the following section, I lay out the institutional setting, available data, and sample selection. In the third section, I present the reform strategy and its results. In the fourth section, I present the regression discontinuity strategy and results.

"Kofoed Michael S.,Frasier Wyatt J.","United States Military Academy, 607 Cullum Road, West Point, New York, 10996, USA,U.S. Army, USA","Received 6 July 2018, Revised 11 March 2019, Accepted 13 March 2019, Available online 30 March 2019, Version of Record 12 April 2019.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2019.03.005,Cited by (18),One concern with employer-based ,"The United States Congress passed the Affordable Care Act (ACA), colloquially termed “Obamacare,” on March 23, 2010. The ACA's proponents in Congress and the White House claimed that the ACA allows more people access to health insurance and reduces their dependence on employer-provided insurance coverage, which in turn creates a more flexible and efficient labor market. In response to a Congressional Budget Office report that the ACA reduces employment, Representative Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) stated that “the Affordable Care Act will enable more than 2 million workers to escape ‘job-lock’—the situation where workers remain tied to employers for access to health insurance benefits” (Blake, 2014). One of the ACA's most prominent coverage-expanding features is the dependent mandate, which requires all private insurance plans that offer dependent child coverage to allow that coverage to continue until the dependent's 26th birthday (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, 2017).====When employees consider leaving a job to find one that better matches their skills, they consider both the benefit their current job provides and the opportunity cost of staying in the job. For young Americans, this option may be another job, an educational opportunity, or some other activity that they perceive increases valuable human capital or lifetime earnings. One opportunity cost of switching jobs is a change in or potential loss of employer-provided health insurance. Workers could choose not to switch to a better match if they perceive that the alternative job's health insurance plan is of lesser quality, more expensive, or nonexistent. In 2016, an individual employee's health insurance coverage cost averaged $5615, with workers contributing $951 of these costs out of pocket (National Conference of State Legislatures, 2017). The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that insurance costs contributed to 7.6 percent of total compensation for private employees and 11.8 percent for state and local employees (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2017). Because of these high costs, many employees could feel locked into their jobs and do not switch employers because of the cost of losing employer-provided health insurance.====Previous literature provides empirical support for the idea that individuals stay in jobs because of health insurance. Madrian (1994) finds that individuals whose spouses have access to insurance are 15–25 percent more likely to leave jobs than those without this coverage, and Hamersma and Kim (2009) find that increases in Medicaid eligibility had a statistically significant positive correlation with job turnover for unmarried women. Empirical evidence indicates that the dependent mandate caused a substantial increase in the number of young adults with insurance coverage. Further research also finds that the mandate decreased the participation of young adults in the labor market (Antwi et al., 2013, Depew, 2015).====While these papers show that there is causal evidence that employer-based health insurance may induce job lock, there are some limitations to generally used data sets. First, there is considerable variability of salary and health benefits among jobs that may be unobservable to the researcher.==== Gruber and Madrian (2004) survey the job lock literature and point out that there is significant unobserved variation in firm size and health insurance plan generosity. For example, small firms are less likely to offer extensive health plans and perhaps charge their workers higher premiums than similar workers at larger firms or in the public sector. One contribution of this paper is that we use data from the U.S. Army which means that all soldiers observed are covered by the same insurance program (TRICARE) and must enroll.====Second, there are endogeneity==== concerns that the timing of when to leave a job could be influenced by the policy change. Third, it is difficult to ascertain the health status of the worker and ensure that our results are not being driven by differences in health rather than portability of health insurance. Finally, it can be unclear in the data as to whether the worker leaves the firm of their own choice or whether the firm laid off the worker. These unobserved factors could attenuate the effects of the ACA (or policies that increase the portability of health insurance) toward zero.====The ideal experiment in this setting would be a situation where workers were paid equally and have access to the same form of health insurance before the policy change. Also, it would be helpful if the date that a worker must consider leaving the firm was set in advance of the policy and there was a clear decision point. Uniformity of worker health would ensure that the worker decided to leave a firm because of insurance and not a negative health shock. Finally, a researcher would want to ensure that workers were given the opportunity to stay but chose to leave, thus signaling that they were locked into a particular job because of the inability to transfer health insurance to their new careers.====U.S. Army data==== remedy several problems inherent in civilian workforce data. First, all Army personnel have nearly identical compensation at each rank and inside each occupational branch. We can easily control for those differences that may exist. One notable benefit the Army provides to soldiers at every rank is their health care network, which allows soldiers full medical coverage at no out of pocket cost. Second, when soldiers enlist into the Army, they set a contract that expires usually in three to five years. Soldiers cannot submit a “two-week” notice and move into the civilian sector without facing high penalties. In this study, we consider soldiers who set their enlistment contracts before Congress passed the ACA. Third, all soldiers must pass stringent health and fitness requirements and may be discharged due to poor health, fitness, or disability. We can easily identify these individuals and have dropped them from our sample. At the end of a soldier's enlistment contract, the Army evaluates her job performance, behavior and the needs of the Army. The Army will not offer a reenlistment opportunity if the soldier's job performance is unsatisfactory or the Army does not need as many soldiers in a particular occupation. If the Army does not offer reenlistment, then the soldier cannot remain in the Army. We condition our data on receiving an offer of reenlistment; thus, if a soldier leaves in our sample it is by her own choice. This feature allows us to distinguish labor demand from supply. While the Army setting is different from other sectors in the labor market, its unique characteristics allow us to avoid certain limitations that may exist in previous studies and alleviate the concerns of unobserved insurance quality and worker health status pointed out by Gruber and Madrian (2004) and Bailey and Chorniy (2016).====Prior to the ACA, a young adult's decision to leave the Army would mean that they may lose health care coverage. Because fully funded health care was not guaranteed outside the military, soldiers may have assessed a low opportunity cost for reenlisting due to the high cost of health care they may have incurred upon leaving the Army. However, soldiers younger than 26 can now leave the military at the end of their contact's term and return to their parents’ insurance plans. This paper hypothesizes that the ACA's dependent insurance mandate causes enlisted soldiers below age 26 to leave the Army at a higher rate due to the decrease in health care costs they now face outside the Army. These lower health care costs increase the value of a soldier's next best option and the opportunity cost of reenlisting.====Our main estimates show that that the ACA reduced reenlistment rates by 1.3 percentage points or 3.14 percent for enlisted soldiers ages 23–25. This result is robust to the addition of various controls and home state of record fixed effects. We estimate various heterogeneous treatment showing that soldiers with increased human capital are the most responsive to the dependent mandate. We also conduct various placebo and robustness tests that use different treatment groups and year specifications to show that our results are a product of the dependent mandate and not contemporaneous year or age effects.====In our sample, the Army offered 137,958 soldiers aged 23–26 the option to reenlist, with 54,316, or 53 percent, of those soldiers electing to reenlist. Our findings imply that the dependent mandate reduced reenlistments by 3255 soldiers. The costs to replace these soldiers include training and recruitment as well as lost human capital within the Army that decreases efficiency and preparedness within units. This paper demonstrates that the ACA effectively changed behavior in young adults and provides evidence of job lock within the Army.====In addition, to better understand the extent of job lock in the military context, we test whether soldiers leaving the Army move to better opportunities in the labor force. To test this hypothesis, we merge Post 9/11 GI Bill usage data to our enlistment records and find that veterans that have access to their parents’ health insurance are more likely to use their GI Bill benefits. These findings are important since turnover due to health insurance portability may increase a firm's costs, but increased education and labor market opportunities are beneficial to the worker. We find that a veteran with access to health insurance because of the dependent mandate is 2.1 percent more likely to attend college on the GI Bill.====Following this introduction, Section 2 provides institutional details. Section 3 provides background on job lock and the ACA's effect on labor markets and explains the contribution this paper makes to existing literature. Section 4 discusses the data, how it helps to overcome issues in other data sets, and its limitations. Section 5 details our empirical model. Section 6 discusses results including the heterogeneous treatment effects. Section 7 presents a host of placebo and robustness checks. Section 8 summarizes results from our model for the effect of the ACA on the uptake of the Post 9-11 GI Bill. Section 9 discusses the results and their generalizability to a broader context of national security and labor market policy.

EDs are potentially life-threatening conditions that affect a person's emotional and physical health in a severe way. EDs may have detrimental effects on cognitive development in children, impair concentration and focus in adolescents, and lead to lower productivity and days lost from work among adults. The seriousness of clinically significant EDs is also exacerbated by the fact that EDs remain challenging to diagnose and treat because patients may be hesitant to seek treatment and tend to persist in their behaviors (Keel et al., 2005, Ham et al., 2013). Their health worsens as EDs develop into more severe stages. In the United States, EDs is the third most common form of chronic illness in the adolescent female population (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).====Despite the severity of EDs, they have only recently received the attention of policy makers. In December 2016, the US Congress passed the first piece of federal legislation specifically designed to help people with EDs in the form of more accessible treatment and prevention across the nation. At the state level, in 2013 Virginia was one of the first States to pass a law requiring provision of ED education and a voluntary ED screening program for students. While there is an increasing effort to design and provide educational and prevention interventions, little is known about their effectiveness at reducing the onset of ED cases (Chao et al., 2014). However, understanding the drivers of EDs at the onset age is crucial because earlier treatment increases the likelihood of physical and emotional recovery.====In this paper, we draw insights from the psychology literature on peers’ influence during adolescence to study a specific channel that might be relevant in the development of EDs. In particular, we consider whether purging is influenced by peers’ average body size through interpersonal comparisons.==== Adolescents are strongly attuned to how they are perceived by those around them, and peers play a substantial role in defining social expectations, establishing identity, and evaluating oneself (Brown et al., 1994). Body image constitutes a major aspect of self-representation and self-evaluation during adolescence and peers provide comparison targets along this dimension. As a result, negative self-evaluations contribute to body dissatisfaction, which in turn may drive the development of EDs (Arigo et al., 2014).====In our analysis, we consider schoolmates in the same grade as reference points. We define the reference group in this way because of the large literature in social psychology arguing that the school environment and its students are important determinants of adolescents’ self-concept. Indeed, adolescents spend a large fraction of their time at school, where they are constantly confronted with peers who provide comparison information about grades, physical appearance, and sports performance (Dijkstra et al., 2008, Buunk and Gibbons, 2007, Keel et al., 2005, Jones et al., 2004).====Quantitatively assessing the importance of this reference group embeds all the common challenges in the estimation of peer effects. We address these challenges by using quasi-random variation in exposure to fellow students within schools and across grades. The idea is to treat the composition of students by grade within a school as quasi-random and use this quasi-random variation as opposed to the variation that can be traced to parental school and residential decisions. This approach has been widely used in studying peer effects in various contexts (e.g. Hoxby, 2000, Hanushek et al., 2003, Angrist and Lang, 2004, Friesen and Krauth, 2007, Bifulco et al., 2011, Lavy and Schlosser, 2011, Lavy et al., 2012, Patacchini and Zenou, 2016, Olivetti et al., 2018).====To implement this approach we use data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health (Add Health). This survey collects information about BMI, body perception, and unhealthy weight control behaviors (UWCB), such as purging, for recent cohorts of U.S. teenagers and their schoolmates. We focus on the likelihood of purging during adolescence because UWCB are risk-factors for full syndrome EDs (Steinhausen et al., 2005). As documented by American Psychiatric Association (2013), purging is observed both in anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa.====Our results reveal that interpersonal comparisons contribute to the onset of EDs for females, but not for males. In addition, not all fellow students have the same influence: only females peers appear to be used for comparison. The effect of the average BMI in the reference group on the probability of purging is significant, sizeable, and negative. A 5 percent increase of group BMI, which is about 1 standard deviation, is associated with a decrease in the probability of purging of about 1 percentage point one year later. Such an effect is rather large when we consider that the prevalence of purging in our sample is 2.5 percent. Relatively heavy girls (i.e. those with a BMI more than one standard deviation above average) are the most susceptible to peer influence. The estimated effect of peers’ BMI for these girls is almost 6 times larger than the one obtained for girls with a BMI around the mean of the peer group. We also find that the estimated effect of peers’ BMI is significantly larger for less popular girls (i.e. those with a number of friends at least one standard deviation below the average), those with lower (verbal) ability, and those with less educated parents.====In addition to estimating the importance of interpersonal comparisons in body size for the onset of EDs, we investigate the pathway responsible for this effect. Results reveal that females with thinner peers perceive themselves heavier than they actually are, and this distorted perception acts as a mediator for the relationship between group BMI and purging.====The idea that individuals assess themselves relative to others has long been recognized in sociology and psychology (Festinger, 1954, Miller et al., 1988, Lockwood and Kunda, 1997). However, it is only recently that the economics literature has provided evidence on the importance of social image concerns for a wide range of behaviors, such as education, consumption, investment decisions, effort in the workplace, voting and charitable giving (Mas, 2006, Fehr and Goette, 2007, Farber, 2008, Card et al., 2012, Charité et al., 2015, Exley and Terry, 2017, Bursztyn and Jensen, 2017). Our analysis contributes to this literature by providing empirical results about how and why interpersonal comparisons affects health-related behavior during adolescence.====Our findings are consistent with a variety of different theories in economics about the importance of social comparisons in shaping individual behavior (see, e.g. Akerlof and Kranton, 2000, Battaglini et al., 2005, Battaglini et al., 2017, Patacchini and Zenou, 2012, Patacchini and Venanzoni, 2014, Liu et al., 2014). They are also in line with the cross-country evidence documented by Blanchflower et al. (2009). Using Eurobarometer data on 29 European countries, they show that own body dissatisfaction, overweight perceptions, and dieting decisions correlate with own BMI relative to the national average for the same gender and age group. Using the same data, Costa-Font and Jofre-Bonet (2013) reach similar conclusions. In the latter case, the outcome of interest is a distorted body perception (as the respondent claims to be “just fine” or “too fat”) when, instead, the respondent's BMI is below 17.5, which might be indicative of anorexic behaviors.====Our evidence suggests that community programs promoting body acceptance and ways to buffer the potentially negative effects of social comparisons are indeed a promising avenue to tackle EDs challenges for female adolescents.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the data and some preliminary evidence. Section 3 describes the identification strategy. Section 4 presents our main estimates of the effects of group BMI for the onset of EDs. Section 5 explores the roots of social comparison. Robustness exercises are discussed in Section 6. Section 8 concludes.","Weight, reference points, and the onset of eating disorders",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629618307094,May 2019,2019,Research Article,318.0

Using insurance claims from 0.85 million individuals and administrative data on store sales, we find that greater store density and more inter-brand competition reduced expenditures on outpatient medical services and prescription drugs. In support of these findings, we demonstrate that convenience store competition was associated with greater consumption of healthy foods and lower obesity rates. Our estimates suggest that the rise in convenience store competition from 2002 to 2012 reduced outpatient expenditures in Taiwan by 0.44 percent and prescription drug expenditures by 0.85 percent.","As rates of obesity and chronic disease have increased worldwide, the associated medical care costs have strained national budgets and individual finances. In the United States the annual medical care costs of obesity rose from $225.1 billion in 2005 to $342.2 billion in 2013 (both in 2013 dollars; Cawley and Meyerhoefer, 2012, Biener et al., 2018). Most of these costs are due to the treatment of chronic diseases that are either caused by or exacerbated by obesity (Thorpe and Philyaw, 2012). Other countries have experienced similar cost increases, with projections of the cumulative global burden caused by chronic disease reaching $47 trillion over a twenty year period (Bloom et al., 2011).====Among the many factors linked to obesity and chronic disease, a recent line of research suggests that the structure of retail food markets contributes to poor nutrition and rising rates of obesity. Studies of U.S. markets focus on residents’ proximity to supermarkets, which are more likely to offer fruits, vegetables and other healthy foods, and their proximity to convenience stores or fast food restaurants, which sell mostly calorie dense and pre-prepared foods. Findings suggest that the presence of supermarkets in one's neighborhood is negatively correlated with body mass index (BMI) and obesity, and the presence of convenience stores is positively correlated with BMI and obesity for both adults and adolescents (Morland et al., 2006, Galvez et al., 2009, Powell et al., 2007, Marlow, 2015). Likewise, children who reside in areas without supermarkets are more likely to be obese (Thomsen et al., 2016, Schafft et al., 2009), as are those who attend school near fast food restaurants (Currie et al., 2010, Davis and Carpenter, 2009). The correlation between poor supermarket access and obesity is consistent with research finding that residents who live far away from supermarkets pay higher prices for food, have limited access to healthy foods, and consume fewer fruits and vegetables (Blanchard and Matthews, 2007, Blanchard and Lyson, 2002, Morland et al., 2002, Laraia et al., 2004).====Despite evidence of a link between food outlet availability and obesity, the effects of food outlet competition on obesity and chronic disease have not been explored, nor have the implications of either market characteristic for medical care costs. There are several reasons why food outlet competition could affect health and medical expenditures. First, competition typically lowers prices (Hausman and Leibtag, 2007, Borrescio-Higo, 2015), and decreases in the relative price of healthy (unhealthy) foods may lower (raise) the incidence and severity of chronic disease and body weight (Meyerhoefer and Leibtag, 2010, Chou et al., 2004, Powell, 2009, Schroeter et al., 2008).==== Second, competition also compels food outlets to raise product quality (Matsa, 2011), which in the case of supermarkets, could cause the substitution of more healthy food for less healthy food. Reductions in rates of obesity and chronic disease through either of these mechanisms will reduce expenditures on medical care (Cawley and Meyerhoefer, 2012, Cawley et al., 2015, Meyerhoefer and Leibtag, 2010).====We extend previous research on the connection between retail food market structure and health by investigating whether greater food outlet density and higher levels of competition impact the use and cost of medical services. In order to empirically identify these relationships we analyze unique data on the convenience store industry in Taiwan from 2002 to 2012. These data are linked to health care claims from Taiwan's national health insurance program which include approximately 0.85 million enrollees in each year. Unlike similarly named stores in the United States, Europe, or South America, convenience stores in Taiwan sell relatively healthy food and provide more nutrition information than their competitors in the market for food away from home, allowing them to compete directly with a broad segment of restaurants. This is in stark contrast to the American or European setting where ready-to-eat food offerings at convenience stores are limited and of relatively low quality, hampering their ability to compete with restaurants. In Taiwan, convenience stores account for just over half of all retail food outlets, and sales contracts with manufacturers make it easy to determine which products can be sold at different prices across convenience store chains (Taiwan Fair Trade Commission [TFTC], 2016). As a result, the convenience store industry in Taiwan is an excellent case study of the effects of inter-brand competition (i.e. competition between convenience store chains, but not between stores within the same chain) on health.====We define market areas at the township-level and calculate measures of inter-brand competition and convenience store density for inclusion in our medical expenditure models. We use a two-part model to account for the skewness of medical expenditures and include control variables for individual characteristics, the supply of healthcare providers, and local environmental conditions. Because we include township and year fixed effects in our baseline models in addition to township-specific linear time trends, identification is based on changes in inter-brand competition or store density over time within township that deviate from a linear trend. Our main findings are robust to the use of quadratic, as opposed to linear, township-specific time trends and to the subset of townships used to identify competitive effects. Specifically, our conclusions remain the same when we restrict the sample to townships without convenience store entry or exit in order to ensure that competition effects are identified solely from changes in market share among pre-existing stores.====Consistent with expectations, we find that greater convenience store density and more inter-brand competition among convenience store chains lowers medical care use and expenditures. We hypothesize that this is due to lower prices and improvements in food and service quality at convenience stores relative to Chinese restaurants, breakfast and lunch shops, night markets and traditional markets that also offer ready-to-eat food. In support of our hypothesis we conduct an additional analysis using survey data and find that greater store density and market competition is associated with an increase in the consumption of more healthy foods, and a decrease in the consumption of less healthy foods. Moreover, rates of obesity are lower among residents living in areas with more intense inter-brand competition and more convenience stores per capita.====While the effects we find are precisely estimated, they are small in magnitude. For example, a change in market structure resulting in a 500 unit reduction in the Herfindahl–Hirschman index (HHI)==== lowers the use of outpatient service and prescription drugs by only 0.14% and 0.15%, respectively. Moreover, a 500 unit reduction in the HHI reduces medical expenditures on outpatient care and prescription drugs by only 0.16% and 0.31%, respectively. This is consistent with recent studies that suggest differences in demand rather than food availability and food prices are the primary determinant of socioeconomic disparities in nutrient consumption (Allcott et al., 2017, Handbury et al., 2016). Our findings therefore suggest that pro-competitive policies applied to venders of healthy food can have small positive public benefits through modest reductions in healthcare costs. By implication, policies that promote the consumption of healthy foods will be more effective if they do not limit competition between food outlets specializing in the sale of such foods.====The results of this paper are relevant to several strands of the literature. First, we make a contribution to the growing literature on the role of food outlets in health determination. Previous studies consider only the impact of food outlet accessibility on health outcomes, without taking into account the level of competition between outlets (e.g., Morland et al., 2006, Galvez et al., 2009, Powell et al., 2007, Marlow, 2015). This may result in inconsistent findings because accessibility and competition need not be positively correlated across all geographic locations, making it difficult to determine the bias caused by the failure to account for competition. For example, it is not clear whether the sum of pecuniary and non-pecuniary costs of food is greater for a household that lives close to a supermarket facing no competition, or a household living far from a supermarket that faces significant competition. We incorporate measures of both food outlet density and competition in our models, and find that inter-brand competition is a stronger determinant of medical care costs than food outlet density as measured by the per capita number of convenience stores. We also provide evidence of the mechanisms responsible for these effects, which has been lacking in previous studies.====This paper also makes a contribution to the literature on the determinants of medical care utilization and costs. While prior studies have considered how access to and competition among medical facilities affect medical care use (e.g., Gaynor and Town, 2011), this is the first study that we are aware of to estimate the separate effects of food outlet density and competition on medical care costs. A final contribution of our study is the use of rich, administrative data on both convenience store location and sales and on medical care costs and utilization. This is particularly important for reducing the potential for measurement error to bias the estimates.","Inter-brand competition in the convenience store industry, store density and healthcare utilization",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016762961830660X,May 2019,2019,Research Article,320.0

We develop a random utility model of physician behavior and, using a range of different panel models, we estimate the likelihood of a physician prescribing a generic versus a branded version of a drug, controlling for a broad set of physician, patient, and drug characteristics. We find no evidence in support of the hypotheses of physicians’ altruism and moral hazard. We find, however, strong and robust evidence that the physicians’ decisions to prescribe branded versions of statins are habit-dependent.====Whereas most of the literature discusses moral hazard from the perspective of patient behaviour, the two hypotheses of physicians’ altruism and moral hazard have been addressed by economists from different perspectives. The role of physicians in healthcare insurance markets has been of interest to economists since the seminal contribution of Arrow (1963). Pioneering the economic analysis of physician behaviour, Arrow (1963) notices that physicians may have motives and objectives that differentiate them from purely profit-maximizing agents.====Together with Arrow (1963); Pauly (1968) develops the original “ex-post moral hazard” hypothesis, predicting that health insurance increases the consumption of healthcare and leads to excessive consumption of services in a competitive healthcare market. Ex-post moral hazard (henceforth simply labeled as moral hazard) has since then been the focus of numerous economic analyses (e.g. Feldstein, 1973;Manning et al., 1987 Dranove, 1989; Ma, 1994; Zweifel and Manning, 2000; Ma and Riordan, 2002).====Building on this literature, some studies have specifically focused on physicians’ moral hazard. Blomqvist (1991), for example, models the physician as a “double agent”, who acts simultaneously on behalf of the patient but also of the insurer (McGuire, 2000; Chone and Ma, 2011).====The double agency hypothesis has then been further developed by a strand of literature that presents physicians as being “altruist” agents who incorporate patients’ utility in their decisions (Woodward and Warren-Boulton, 1984; Ellis and McGuire, 1986; Farley, 1986; Chalkley and Malcolmson, 1998; Jack, 2005). More recently, a series of recent laboratory experiments have empirically tested the hypothesis of physician altruism with convenience samples of medical students, and have found heterogeneity in medical students’ altruistic motivation towards the patients’ health benefis (Hennig-Schmidt et al., 2011; Godager and Wiesen, 2013; Hennig-Schmidt and Wiesen, 2014; Brosig-Koch et al., 2017). There is also evidence of stronger altruistic motivation in physicians than in students (Brosig-Koch et al., 2016).====In the more specific context of prescription drugs, Hellerstein (1998) models the physicians’ moral hazard hypothesis by looking at a physician facing a choice between prescribing a branded or a generic version of a drug to her patient. Hellerstein (1998) assumes that both the (indirect) utility of the patient and the insurance expenditures enter the utility function of the physician. The physician internalises a share of the patient’s utility in her own utility function, but also a share of the drug costs covered by the insurer. In line with observational evidence, Hellerstein (1998) assumes that the branded version of the drug is more expensive than the generic version. The model shows that, if the physician places a higher weight on the patient’s utility than on insurance expenditures, an increase in the insurance coverage decreases (increases) the likelihood of the generic (branded) prescription. An increase in the insurance coverage, in fact, increases insurance expenditures and decreases patient’s expenditures, ceteris paribus. As both these variables have a similar effect on the physician’s utility, higher insurance coverage leads to a lower probability of generic prescribing when the physician values the utility of the patient more than the insurance expenditure.====A few studies have tested empirically the hypotheses of physicians’ moral hazard and altruism in the context of pharmaceutical prescriptions by looking at the physicians’ actual choices of prescribing either a generic or a branded version of the drug (Hellerstein, 1998; Lundin, 2000; Mott and Cline, 2002; Granlund, 2009; and Liu et al., 2009). However, the evidence to date in this area is mixed and not conclusive (see Section 2 for further detail on the literature). Additionally, physician objectives are modeled differently across the different studies, that often use the terms moral hazard and altruism quite interchangeably.====Our research builds on these previous contributions in that we test both the altruism and the moral hazard hypotheses in drug prescription behaviour using a national panel register of administrative data from Finland capturing physicians prescription decisions.====We first illustrate a simple theoretical model on physician decision-making based on Hellerstein (1998) which predicts that the higher is the patient’s insurance coverage for pharmaceutical expenditures, the more likely it is that physicians prescribe an expensive branded version of a drug. We use the model to explicitly define the research hypotheses on altruism and moral hazard to be empirically tested. This is important because, as mentioned, the previous literature has used different operational definitions of altruism and moral hazard, and the two terms have often been used interchangeably.====We then use a national panel dataset with ==== statins prescriptions in Finland between 2003 and 2010 to empirically test the physicians’ altruism and moral hazard hypotheses, while controlling for a broad range of physician, patient, and drug characteristics.====Our work innovatively contributes to the previous literature in five respects. First, by using a national register, we consider the entire “universe” of the statins prescriptions in Finland. Hellerstein (1998); Lundin (2000); Mott and Cline (2002); Granlund (2009), and Liu et al. (2009) all consider specific samples of prescriptions in the US, Sweden, and Taiwan. Lundin (2000), for example, only considers data for seven drugs dispensed in two pharmacies. Considering the universe of prescriptions allows us to characterise the full set of drugs competing in the market and the whole choice set of alternatives available to physicians. Moreover, considering the universe of prescriptions allows us to draw conclusions at a level that is representative of the population, alike (Leibowitz et al., 1985 and, in a different context, Coscelli, 2000).====Second, we focus on one therapeutic class of drugs that requires repeated prescriptions to target a chronic condition. Hellerstein (1998); Lundin (2000) and Mott and Cline (2002) all include very diverse types of drugs in their analyses, considering both drugs that require repeated prescriptions together with one-off drugs. For example Lundin (2000) and Hellerstein (2008) consider antidepressants and cardiovascular diseases drugs that are of repeated use together with antibiotics and laxatives that tend to be prescribed for acute episodes. Focusing on one therapeutic class of drugs that requires repeated prescriptions to target a chronic condition is important for two reasons. The first reason is that - alike Liu et al. (2009) and (Coscelli, 2000) - it allows us to assess patterns of prescription over time for the same patient, and to measure how physicians’ inertia in switching to generics is affected by their prescribing habits. This effect might be diluted when considering drugs that target both acute and chronic conditions and when considering data covering short periods of time (e.g. two weeks in Hellerstein, 2008; two years in Lundin, 2000). The second reason is that chronic conditions are of key policy interest given that they are major determinants of disease burden in OECD countries, and that the costs associated with their therapeutic management are a major driver of healthcare expenditure. In particular we focus on statins that target cardiovascular diseases, which are the first cause of death globally (WHO, 2004).====Third, we directly control for a broad range of physician, patient, and drug characteristics. This is an important innovation because neither Hellerstein (1998) nor Lundin (2000) have information on income and other patient characteristics, while Mott and Cline (2002) and Iizuka (2012) find that preferences and tastes of prescribers and patients are significantly associated with drugs prescriptions and generics substitution (a point also made by Coscelli, 2000). We also have direct information on prices for all branded and generic versions of the statins in Finland, whereas Hellerstein (1998), for example, has no information on drug prices. The characterization of the cost associated with each drug prescribed, as well as its market alternatives, is key for the assessment of moral hazard.====Fourth, taking advantage of the panel structure of our national administrative register, we directly observe the repeated prescriptions of statins by physicians over time - to the same patient as well as to the whole population of patients of the same physician. Hence, by directly observing repeated prescriptions for all physician-patient pairs over time we can explicitly model habit-dependent prescriptions in our panel estimations. This is important as Hellerstein (1998); Mott and Cline (2002), and Iizuka (2012) (as well as Coscelli, 2000) find that prescribers’ habits are significantly associated with prescriptions and generics substitution, even controlling for physician and insurer characteristics. Hellerstein (1998), however, lacks information on patients’ prescription histories since her dataset only covers a two-week period. Neither Hellerstein (1998) nor Lundin (2000) data allow capturing physician specific habit, as they do not observe all the patients of a specific physician over time. The possibility of habits persistence in pharmaceutical consumption is also acknowledged by Granlund (2009) as an important aspect to be explicitly modelled. Modelling habits persistence is particularly crucial in the context of statins and chronic diseases where physicians file multiple prescriptions over years or even decades.====Finally, our data is unique in that it contains linked information on both dispensed and prescribed drugs. This allows us to disentangle whether the generic substitution occurred by the initiative of the physician or the pharmacist. For a variety of reasons (such as pharmacy incentives, lack of stock, generic substitution policies, among others) dispensed drugs might not correspond to prescribed drugs. Therefore, using dispensing data only (as Liu et al., 2009, for example) would not allow assessing physician prescription behaviour. On the other hand, using prescription data only, and thus not observing the amount paid when the drugs are dispensed at the pharmacy (as Hellerstein, 1998), would not allow observing the costs associated with a prescription including the amount borne by the patient and by the insurer, which are both of key importance in order to test the altruism and moral hazard hypotheses associated with generic substitution by the physician.====To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first national panel register to date in which the hypotheses of moral hazard and altruism are explicitly tested in regard to drugs prescription behavior.====Our main findings are the following. We find no evidence in support of the hypotheses of physicians’ altruism and moral hazard: although, due to the large number of observations, the estimated coefficients associated with moral hazard and altruism are statistically significant, their size is very close to zero, and their effects would not be considered economically meaningful from a policy or business perspective. When the analysis distinctly accounts for the shares of statins expenditure borne by the patient and the insurer, and controls for a broad range of physician, patient, and drug characteristics, the estimated coefficients directly reject the hypotheses of physician altruism and moral hazard. Moreover, the average marginal effects of moral hazard and altruism are negligible and orders of magnitude smaller than the average marginal effects associated with other key explanatory factors, such as the class of the prescribed statins, the year of prescription, and the physician specialization.====We find, however, strong and robust evidence that the physicians’ decisions to prescribe branded versions of statins in Finland are habit-dependent: physicians who have prescribed more branded drugs in the past are significantly less likely to switch to generic versions, and the effect is prominent and economically large.====The rest of the article is organized as follows: Section 2 contains a brief literature review discussing the main existing studies in the area to date, and how our study relates to this literature. Section 3 is a self-contained description of the institutional background in Finland, in particular on the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceuticals. Section 4 presents a simple theoretical framework based on Hellerstein (1998) that generates the hypotheses to be tested empirically. Section 5 presents the data and Section 6 the econometric model.

The figures are notable: 105 merger deals were reported in 2012 alone, an increase from an average of 50 to 60 annually in the pre-ACA and pre-recession years of 2005–2007 (Dafny, 2014). Catholic hospital systems have actively participated in this merger frenzy, with 120 mergers between Catholic and non-Catholic systems between 2001 and 2016 (Uttley and Khaikin, 2016), a fifteen-year growth rate of 22%. Four out of the top ten largest health care systems (and four of the top five non-profit systems) were Catholic affiliated, and Catholic hospitals accounted for 14.5% of all acute care hospitals and one in six acute care hospital beds in 2016 (Uttley and Khaikin, 2016).====Ownership changes that affiliate a hospital with a Catholic owner, network, or system, are consequential because they reduce the set of possible contraceptive medical procedures. Specifically, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops’ (USCCB) Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services forbid sterilization procedures, contraceptives, in vitro fertilization and abortion at Catholic health care facilities (USCCB, 2009). As a result, a rise in mergers between Catholic and secular hospitals and health systems over the past decade has drawn increased attention to the directives’ impact on access to reproductive health care services at such facilities. For example, in October of 2015, the American Civil Liberties Union sued Trinity Health (the second largest Catholic Health System that owns 86 hospitals in 21 states) for not performing abortions when medically necessary. The lay press, medical and legal journals have featured discussions about the impact of these ownership changes on patient care, particularly with regard to reproductive health, such as abortions and sterilizations, and have drawn attention to the $45 billion in federal funding these hospital systems receive each year (Catholics for Choice, 2005, National Women's Law Center, 2011, Abelson, 2012, Mencimer, 2013, Martin, 2013, Lee, 2016). This is in addition to other new restrictions on reproductive health care services that proliferated over the past decade (Packham, 2017, Quast et al., 2017, Fischer et al., 2017, Cunningham et al., 2017, Bailey and Lindo, 2018, Lu and Slusky, 2018). Existing research on the potential effect of Catholic ownership on patient care has relied on qualitative interviews of patients and doctors (Rubin et al., 2006, Stulberg et al., 2014). This paper examines the effect of Catholic affiliation on reproductive health procedures and finds significant reductions in tubal ligations.====To illuminate the potential consequences of Catholic owned hospitals, we examine the effect of changes in ownership from secular to Catholic (and vice versa) on reproductive health procedures such as tubal ligation, abortion, vasectomy, hysterectomy, and dilation and curettage (D&C)==== that are likely to be affected by Catholic ownership and banned under the USCCB Ethical and Religious Directives.==== In particular, we investigate the following question: How does Catholic ownership affect the rates of reproductive procedures restricted under the USCCB Directives? We hypothesize that changes to Catholic ownership result in a reduction in the rates of these procedures. We also investigate how Catholic affiliation of a hospital affects the fertility rate, women's hospital choice, and complications after miscarriage.====To test our hypothesis, we use the universe of hospitals in six states and compile publicly available data on Catholic hospital mergers to identify hospitals that do not change location but change ownership. We use within-hospital and across-patient variation to control for potential differences in patient population across different types of hospitals, including a hospital fixed effect. In particular, our study exploits changes in affiliation only (such changes are in name, administration, and affiliation) with the hospital location unchanged. We use longitudinal data on hospital procedures to identify the causal effect of Catholic ownership on reproductive health procedures, with a particular focus on tubal ligations. We find evidence that Catholic ownership of hospitals decreases the rate of tubal ligations by 30%. We find suggestive evidence that vasectomies and abortions also decrease, but are rarely performed in an inpatient setting, so these estimates are less precise. We do not find evidence that changes in Catholic ownership are related to changes in the number of births, Caesarian sections, or miscarriages.====Anecdotal reports have suggested that Catholic hospitals are putting women in danger due to the restrictions on miscarriage management. Contrary to these reports, we find some evidence that Catholic ownership is in fact associated with a reduction in miscarriages that involve a complication, suggesting that anecdotal accounts may not be indicative of a widespread pattern. Hysterectomies are another form of female sterilization restricted by the USCCB Ethical and Religious Directives. We find a reduction in hysterectomies among women of childbearing age, which is less precisely estimated but consistent with the findings for tubal ligations. Hysterectomies are also performed in response to hemorrhage, so a reduction may also be indicative of improved quality. That said, we do not find any evidence of a decrease in severe maternal morbidity with Catholic ownership that would support an overall conclusion of improved quality.====Current literature suggests that this growth in mergers and affiliation changes are part of a broader trend in hospital consolidation likely driven by multiple factors such as economies of scale, financial distress, desires to expand market power, and risk management strategies in response to health care reform (Dafny, 2014, Uttley and Khaikin, 2016, Neprash et al., 2017). We test our identifying assumption by estimating how changes in ownership affect the composition of reproductive patients, hospital characteristics, and controlling for changes in unemployment in the county where the hospital is located. We find some suggestive evidence that after a switch to Catholic ownership, hospitals may have a slight increase in the share of reproductive patients that are Black and a slight increase in the number of beds, though neither effect is precisely estimated. When we control for these characteristics in our main specification, the results are consistent. Our results are also robust to the inclusion of the county unemployment rate.====There may be national trends in use of these reproductive procedures that are concurrent with our study period. Data from the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) from 1980 to 2014 reflect a fairly steady rate of female sterilization (i.e., tubal ligation) of 27.5% for all women and 37.8% for married women nationally (Bailey and Lindo, 2018). This rate has started to decline somewhat after 2010 with the introduction of Long Acting Reversible Contraceptives (LARC) such as IUDs. These data suggest that in the latter part of our study period, there could be secular trends reducing the use of tubal ligation. According to these national survey data, the most prevalent and persistent use of tubal ligation is among women aged 35–44; thus, we also stratify our estimates by age. Our results are robust to inclusion of state-year fixed effects that should at least partially account for changes in state-level insurance coverage for reproductive procedures that might also influence the population seeking tubal ligation.====Our paper contributes to a well-established literature that investigates the impact of access to contraception on fertility and women's health outcomes. This literature has focused on both increases and decreases in access to family planning programs, abortion clinics, and availability of emergency contraception. The conceptual framework used to understand how access to these programs affects fertility rates in particular is ambiguous. Bailey and Lindo (2018), in their recent review, argue that empirical evidence is critical to understand the direction of the effect. For example, decreases in access to abortion or sterilization may induce women to substitute toward other forms of contraception (e.g., the pill or LARC). Access to emergency contraception may increase risky sex and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) but reduce abortion rates and have little effect on overall fertility (Mulligan, 2016; Cintina and Johansen, 2015). Our findings suggest that limiting access to sterilization and abortion through Catholic ownership does not affect the general fertility rate (GFR) in the hospital referral region of hospitals that switch to or from Catholic. When controlling for an index of policies that promote access to emergency contraception, we do not find that those policies have a statistically significant effect on our outcomes of interest.====Our paper also contributes to a limited literature regarding patient loyalty and hospital choice. Lay media suggests that women may not know that their hospital is Catholic or that there are restrictions on these reproductive services.==== They may learn, however, after giving birth and may choose to switch to a different hospital for the following birth. Irace (2018) exploits hospital closures due to Hurricane Sandy and finds that patients are persistent in their hospital choice across multiple conditions. Chartock et al. (2018) find that surprise out-of-network bills on the first birth increases the odds of switching hospitals for the second birth by 13%. Raval and Rosenbaum (2018) analyze patients’ choices of hospital for childbirth in Florida and find that 70% of women return to the same hospital in a following birth and that without switching costs, their choice model would predict a 40% persistence in hospital choice, and that network restrictions like those in the ACA result in unambiguous welfare losses. This is fairly consistent with our finding that 30% of women switch hospitals between births. We find, however, that women are 50% more likely to switch to a non-Catholic hospital when their first hospital becomes Catholic between deliveries, which is likely to also result in welfare losses of the magnitude measured in their paper. We acknowledge that this switching is a plausible mechanism behind our results, but we do not believe it is the driving one.====We make some effort to estimate the welfare effect of these hospital changes by looking at racial and payer subgroups and high and low competitive hospital referral regions (HRR) to try to understand whether there are any disparities that come from these ownership changes. We find that Hispanic mothers are disproportionately affected by restrictions to tubal ligation. We also find some suggestive evidence that the reductions in tubal ligations are larger in HRRs that have less competition and fewer alternative hospitals for women to seek care. We perform a back-of-the-envelope calculation and estimate that these results translate to 10,000 fewer tubal ligations per year. This is particularly concerning for populations that use tubal ligations to prevent unwanted pregnancies.====Multiple robustness (such as sample selection, balanced panel, alternative outcome measures) and falsification checks (such as differences in miscarriages, Caesarian sections or births), including count and Poisson fixed effects models, did not show strong evidence that our results are sensitive to these alternative specifications or outcome measures. Due to the small number of switching hospitals that we identify our results off of, we use a number of clustering methods including bootstrapping our standard errors, and these results provide additional confidence in our conclusions. We further address potential concerns about bias in generalized difference-in-differences by implementing a method developed by Goodman-Bacon (2018) and show that our common trends assumption holds using a new balance test and that our results are robust to using the weights proposed.====Our paper interacts with the literature on hospital regulation by showing the consequences of the lack of regulation, where hospitals are permitted to deny procedures based on religious grounds. This is in contrast to the majority of the existing literature (e.g., Salkever, 2000, Cook et al., 2010, Dranove, 2011, Chung et al., 2017, Clemens and Ippolito, 2017) which focuses on overt regulations (e.g., pricing, staffing, payments, investments, and competitiveness), rather than services offered. In our case, a recent accommodation by the Supreme Court that allows religious non-profit and for-profit entities to opt out of providing contraceptives under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) (e.g., Burwell v. Hobby Lobby) suggests that there may be limited policy responses to curb these restrictions, and so it is important to evaluate the impact of these restrictions on fertility and ascertain which women are most likely to be affected. It is equally important to measure the impacts in order to weigh the trade-offs between a woman's autonomy over her health and body versus an organization's view of being complicit in another person's access to religiously forbidden activities. We cannot weigh these without measures of the costs and benefits.====Lack of access to reproductive procedures studied in this paper can have reverberations to women's long-term economic outcomes as well as the outcomes of their children. Bailey et al. (2018) show that children born after family planning programs were expanded from 1965 to 1973 were significantly less likely to grow up in poverty and Bailey et al. (2012) found that 30% of the convergence of the gender wage gap in the 1990s was attributed to increased access to contraception. Research has shown that unintended and mistimed pregnancies are associated with substantially higher odds of low birth weight babies (Hall et al., 2017), less prenatal care and lower breastfeeding rates (Kost and Lindberg, 2015), maternal behaviors that adversely affect child health (Joyce et al., 2000), and a higher risk of child abuse and neglect (Guterman, 2015).",Reproductive health care in Catholic-owned hospitals,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629618306581,May 2019,2019,Research Article,322.0

We estimate the impacts of information provided by Korea's National Health Screening Program by applying a ==== around different biomarker thresholds of diabetes, obesity, and ==== risk using administrative data that includes medical claims, biomarkers, and behavioral surveys over four years after screening. Generally, we find limited responses to disease risk information alone. However, we find evidence for ","Health behavior is an important determinant for health, especially in industrialized countries where morbidity and mortality are primarily related to chronic or lifestyle diseases (Cawley and Ruhm, 2012). For instance, the World Health Organization (2009) identifies that the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in high income countries are modifiable risk factors, including overweight and obesity, physical inactivity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high cholesterol, and tobacco and alcohol use. However, people often resist engaging in healthy behaviors that have positive future health outcomes. One explanation is that individuals have imperfect information about the benefits of healthy behaviors or about their own health status (Kenkel, 1991, Sloan et al., 2003).==== To address the lack of information, many developed countries provide public health screening.==== These policies assume that the information provided from screening will promote desirable health behaviors and early treatment that would prevent disease or reduce complications.====We test this assumption in this paper by investigating whether individuals modify their health behavior in response to the disease risk classification information provided in their health screening report card.==== In addition, we account for when this disease risk classification information is combined with further medical intervention—active prompting for a secondary examination and, if diagnosis is confirmed, treatment. Specifically, we apply a regression discontinuity design that takes advantage of the fact that disease risk classifications and prompting for a secondary examination for diabetes, obesity, and hyperlipidemia==== vary discontinuously with levels of fasting blood sugar, body mass index (BMI), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, respectively, at cutoffs that are arbitrary in the sense that individuals just below and just above a cutoff share otherwise similar characteristics.====Our study setting is one of the world's largest health screening programs, the National Health Screening Program (NHSP) in Korea. The NHSP provides free general health screening to the entire population aged 40 and over. The NHSP includes a variety of tests for health screening including diabetes, obesity, and hyperlipidemia, and is combined with a survey that collects information on health behaviors. We use data on a 2% random sample of the population from administrative data provided by the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) in Korea, which includes more than 350,000 screening participants observed from 2009 to 2013. The size of the dataset allows us to implement a regression discontinuity design with enough precision to estimate null impacts or rule out small impacts. Also, the richness of the dataset—longitudinal administrative data that includes medical claims, biomarkers, and a survey of health behavior over four years after screening—allows us to test the effect of screening on a range of behaviors and health outcomes, both in the short and long-term.====We find that providing disease risk classification information is, in general, not effective in inducing changes in behavior. For example, we find little to no differences in behavior around the medium risk thresholds for diabetes and obesity. In addition, we do not find changes in behavior around the high risk (disease suspected) thresholds for obesity and hyperlipidemia. Although we find an increase in the number of outpatient visits for those who were informed as high risk for hyperlipidemia, this does not translate to increased medical treatment or changes in behavior.====However, we do find increased diabetes medication and weight loss around the high risk (disease suspected) threshold for diabetes, where information is combined with prompting for a secondary examination and, if diagnosis is confirmed, treatment. Specifically, those just above the cutoff are prescribed 20.9 days more of diabetes medication (a 73.3% change), reduce BMI by 0.16 kg/m==== (a 0.6% change), and reduce waist circumference by 1 cm (a 1.1% change) in the short-run. In the long-run, however, the observed short-run impacts are attenuated and no longer statistically significant. Our results suggest that information alone is not necessarily sufficient to lead to behavioral changes and better health outcomes, and that further medical intervention in addition to the disease risk classification information could increase the marginal benefits of screening.====Our study makes three important contributions. First, this paper complements the literature on how risk information affects health behaviors and health outcomes, by studying a setting where in some instances only risk information is provided and in other instances risk information coincides with diagnosis and medical treatment. In addition, our unique setting with three major lifestyle diseases (diabetes, obesity, and hyperlipidemia) and longitudinal administrative data allows us to have a comprehensive understanding on the role of information on disease risk. These distinctions are important because earlier papers, which focus on a specific disease through a relatively short period of time, have found mixed results which may have been conditional on whether only information was provided or whether information was synonymous with diagnosis and treatment. For instance, large impacts are found in individuals with confirmed Huntington Disease, a life threatening disease with no cure (Oster et al., 2013), and in newborns with Very Low Birth Weight classification, which is combined with medical treatment (Almond et al., 2010). Modest behavior changes are found with diagnosis of diabetes (Slade, 2012, Oster, 2015), HIV (Thornton, 2008), and hypertension (Zhao et al., 2013). However, limited effects are found for overweight classification (Almond et al., 2016, Prina and Royer, 2014), diabetes genetic risk group (Wu et al., 2016), and pre-diabetes status (Iizuka et al., 2017), none of which are combined with medical treatment.====Second, the quasi-experimental regression discontinuity design that we implement allows us to control for confounding factors that would make it difficult to disentangle the endogenous relationship between information on disease risk and outcomes. In fact, the use of suitable methods to control for endogeneity is particularly important to understand the behavior changes after a disease diagnosis because the relative risk of developing a disease is often correlated with past behaviors of individuals. Among quasi-experimental studies, our study is closest to papers that employ a regression discontinuity design based on diagnostic thresholds of birth weight for very low birth weight classification for newborns (Almond et al., 2010), systolic blood pressure for hypertension (Zhao et al., 2013), BMI for obesity (Almond et al., 2016), aorta size for abdominal aortic aneurysm (Dahlberg et al., 2016), and fasting blood sugar for pre-diabetes (Iizuka et al., 2017).====Lastly, this study provides evidence of the impact of risk information from screening on outcomes at a population level, based on a national health screening program. As Kim and Lee (2017) discuss, effects in the population-based screening setting might differ from those provided by clinical RCTs due to selection and crowd out. Thus, our setting provides rare practical evidence to inform national-level screening initiatives in other countries.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

Differently from income-based measures, material hardship provides a more specific description of the concrete adversities faced by the elderly. We have used the last six waves of the Health and Retirement Study to explore the relative contributions of state dependence, unobserved heterogeneity and time-specific ==== on reporting poor health, experiencing food insecurity and medication cutbacks. We have used a Latent Markov model to estimate a multivariate non-linear system of equations for panel data allowing time-varying unobserved heterogeneity. Our results reveal a high state dependence of both health and material hardship conditions. Estimated trajectories reveal that pathways of material hardship are associated differently with health. Material hardship is also spread across its dimensions.","Empirical analyses of health dynamics have received a considerable attention in the health economics literature. Several empirical studies have focused on the relationship between socioeconomic status and health (e.g. Contoyannis et al., 2004a, Contoyannis et al., 2004b, Salas, 2002), while others have focused on how poverty harms health (e.g. McDonough and Berglund, 2003, McDonough et al., 2005). Although the direction of the causal relationship between socioeconomic status – or poverty – and health still remains unclear (e.g. Smith, 1999), many empirical findings show a positive health income gradient. Thus the lack of money restricts the access to the fundamental conditions of health: adequate medical care, good nutrition and proper housing (e.g. McDonough et al., 2005, Halliday, 2017, Meraya et al., 2018).====According to the most recent snapshot on poverty, reported by the Census Bureau in the U.S., the number of poor has decreased in the last decades for most demographic groups. However, in the last two years, adults of 65 and older were the only population group to experience an increase in poverty (Semega et al., 2017). For this reason understanding poverty among the elderly is becoming ever more important. Moreover aging and the growth of the related health care costs pose a serious threat to social programs for the elderly and their financial security (Ozturk and Macdonald, 2017).====However, income-based measures may not be fully adequate to capture individual well-being, as income only indirectly captures people's capabilities, material deprivation and hardship (Iceland and Bauman, 2007). Thus, going beyond income poverty and using more general measures based on material hardship – such as food security, cutting back on medications because of its cost, difficulty in paying bills etc. – might provide a better picture of individual condition. Material hardship refers to the inadequate consumption of very basic goods and services. The measures used to describe hardship focus on individual experiences and living conditions (e.g., food insufficiency, housing quality), rather than consumption in relationship to the needs.====Several empirical analyses in the U.S. have shown that income poverty and material hardship are not the same, that is, poor families and those experiencing material hardships are distinct concepts, whose groups may have only partially overlapping membership (Short, 2005). Moreover, measures of material hardship are a potentially useful tool for policy analysis and program evaluation, especially when “in-kind” benefits and service-based cash transfers (e.g., food stamps, Medicaid, work supports and services) are involved (Ouellette et al., 2007).====Many works have focused on material hardship among non-elderly population in the US, such as single-mother families (Iceland and Bauman, 2007) and children (Bhattacharya et al., 2004). However, very little has been done among the elderly (Charles et al., 2006, Levy, 2015). The distinction between poverty and material hardship may become even more relevant in this context. Particularly, age-related decline in physical and cognitive health may exacerbate individual well-being even when income level is relatively high (Levy, 2015).====Given the above issues, the aim of this paper is to explore the dynamics of health and material hardship among the elderly in the U.S. and, in doing so, we have concerned ourselves with three tasks.====First, we aim to gain a better understanding of the ==== evolution of material hardship and health. While many empirical studies have investigated the determinants of the dynamics of health and poverty trajectories separately (Contoyannis et al., 2004b, Contoyannis et al., 2004a, Halliday, 2008, Ozturk and Macdonald, 2017, Meraya et al., 2018), little, if no attention, has been devoted to material hardship and health. Nevertheless, only a few studies have addressed the question on how these two processes have evolved over time. McDonough and Berglund (2003) and McDonough et al. (2005) explore the relationship between poverty and long-term health posing great emphasis on the role of time on being poor or not poor. In particular, they note that long periods of poverty differ so fundamentally from the short ones. Therefore, the causes and consequences on health are substantially different. They find that poverty history of any kind is health damaging, although different types of long-term poverty patterns (e.g. stable nonpoor, exiting poverty, entering poverty and stable poor) affect self-rated health trajectories in different ways. However, heterogeneity in poverty patterns may also systematically reflect heterogeneity in health trajectories. Following this perspective, it is possible that some unobservable factors, which systematically affect health, may also be associated to material hardship.====Second, we have evaluated the relative contribution of time-varying unobserved heterogeneity and state dependence to health and material hardship. The standard approach to study either health or poverty transitions relies on setting a dynamic model and capturing the state dependence (Heckman, 1981a). This is the direct effect of having experienced a certain situation on the probability of experiencing the same situation in the subsequent period by controlling for unobservable factors (e.g. environment, individual ability, time preference, risk aversion, etc.). However, unobservable factors are generally assumed not to vary over time, while in practice this is possible. For example, Wilde and Nord (2005) studied the effect of Food Stamp Program (FSP) on food insecurity. They found that this effect drops substantially when controlling for time-varying factors. They interpret this result as evidence that time-varying observable and unobservable factors are crucial in explaining food insecurity, since they affect hardships strike from time to time. Moreover, the assumption that unobserved heterogeneity is time-constant, when health dynamics are considered could be very restrictive.====Third, we aimed to capture how time-specific shocks affect material hardship and health status. In particular, changes in material hardship may have a long-term or a short-term effect on health status, this is generally captured by state dependence or unobservable factors. However, it is plausible to expect that a time-specific shock affecting the probability of reporting poor health might also increase the probability of experiencing material hardship in the same period. This effect is particularly relevant as it describes how a current, rather than persistent, change in any unobservable factors affect the relationship between health and material hardship conditions.====In order to study the dynamics of material hardship and health among individuals aged sixty-five and older, we exploited the last six waves of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), and used Self-Assessed Health (SAH) status to measure individual health. To measure individual's hardships we used one indicator of food insecurity and one capturing the occurrence of cutbacks on medications because of cost.====Differently from the standard random effects model used to study health dynamics, we exploit some recent developments on marginal Latent Markov (LM) model (Bartolucci and Farcomeni, 2009) to estimate a multivariate dynamic random effects with time-variant heterogeneity. This model allows to capture the time-varying unobserved heterogeneity in a relative flexible way by also taking into account state dependence and other possible sources of residual time-specific correlation. Time-varying heterogeneity is modelled by a set of subject-specific parameters, which are time-varying and follow a first-order Markov chain. These parameters reveal the structure of the underlying unobserved heterogeneity by identifying different unobserved “types”, which lump together individuals with similar trajectories in material hardship and health. Particularly, we have identified three types, corresponding to different subgroups in the population. The first two groups do not experience material hardship, although the first one is healthier than the second one. Finally, the third group identifies individuals sharing the same propensity of suffering material hardship with poor health condition. From this perspective these are the most disadvantaged individuals.====The paper is organized as follows: the next section describes the data; in Section 3, we set up our empirical strategy; Section 4 explores our findings. Finally, Section 5 concludes and discusses the relevance of our findings for health policy.",The unobserved pattern of material hardship and health among older Americans,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629618301255,May 2019,2019,Research Article,324.0

To explain these empirical observations, I propose a model of motivated belief formation, in which an agent's decision to engage in health risk denial balances the psychological benefits of reduced anxiety with the physical cost of underprevention. I use the model to study firms’ price-setting behavior and incentive to innovate. I also show that tax-funded prevention subsidies are welfare enhancing.","People cope with their anxiety about falling ill in two distinct ways. They either take preventative measures or deny the severity of the health risk they face. These two coping mechanisms are strategic substitutes. A person who takes sufficient precautions is likely to remain healthy and has no reason to be anxious and engage in denial. Conversely, a person who engages in denial about the health risks she is facing will deem preventative health care investments less essential. I formalise this tension between coping by investing in prevention and coping by denying reality in a simple model.====Consider an agent who experiences anxiety about contracting a disease in the form of anticipatory utility, as in Loewenstein (1987) and Caplin and Leahy (2001). For her, optimism about health risks has the psychological benefit of reducing anxiety but also carries the physical costs associated with failing to make some sensible investments in her health. Suppose that the agent chooses the belief that is optimal in light of this trade-off, as in Brunnermeier and Parker (2005) and Oster et al. (2013).====Choosing optimistic beliefs, or engaging in health risk denial, is more attractive to the agent if her ==== is limited. A limited ability to act may be brought about by a low income, a lack of empowerment, or prevention technologies that are unavailable, expensive or ineffective. These factors keep the agent from taking action, leave her relatively exposed to health risks and therefore imply large psychological benefits from engaging in denial.====By decreasing the perceived value of preventative health care investments, motivated denial decreases the demand for prevention. It also makes demand more sensitive to the price and the effectiveness of the prevention technology. A price increase not only decreases demand through a standard price effect, but also increases the degree of optimism, which in turn further decreases demand. Demand is especially low and especially price-sensitive in resource-constrained settings, where, due to the agent's limited ability to act, motivated denial will be most severe.====A denialist's subjective health risk and her resulting valuation of a prevention technology are responsive to features of the market for preventative health care. Both subjective risk and valuation are higher in the low-price environment of perfect competition than under monopoly. However, because denialist consumers are more price-sensitive than rational consumers, a monopolist charges them lower prices.====Lower monopoly prices lead to lower profits, which in turn discourage R&D spending on the invention of new prevention technologies, especially for developing-country diseases. The effect of motivated denial on a monopolist's incentive to invest in marginal improvements in the effectiveness of her product is more ambiguous. While the agent's lower demand level provides a disincentive, her higher demand sensitivity provides an incentive for the monopolist to invest. In resource-constrained settings, the former dominates and incentives for marginal innovations are blunted.====My model helps explain several findings in the empirical literature on health behavior (see Section 2.1 for a discussion). This literature documents optimistic beliefs about health risks, low demand for prevention, highly price-sensitive behavior and little investment by firms in R&D. Moreover, these tendencies appear to be more pronounced in resource-constrained settings. Of course there are competing explanations for each of these findings. But my model offers a parsimonious unifying explanation that the disparate arguments found in the literature fail to provide. For example, underprevention in resource-constrained settings may be explained by liquidity constraints, exogenous overoptimism, or impatience. However, as I show in Appendix D, unlike motivated denial, these other impediments to demand generally imply behavior that is not very responsive to changes in the environment.====The model also yields an important policy implication. In the absence of health externalities, a rational agent's preventative efforts should never be subsidized, because her decision already optimally trades off the costs and benefits of investing in prevention. In contrast, for a denialist, a tax-funded prevention subsidy increases overall welfare, because it commits her to invest in prevention more frequently, thereby decreasing the physical cost associated with motivated denial.====This paper applies the motivated cognition framework (Akerlof and Dickens, 1982, Bénabou and Tirole, 2002, Brunnermeier and Parker, 2005) to the prevention of health risks. I follow the optimal expectations model (Brunnermeier and Parker, 2005, Oster et al., 2013) in assuming that people obtain utility from their beliefs and that beliefs are objects of choice. I go beyond the current literature by demonstrating that motivated cognition can lead to behavior that is highly sensitive to changes in the environment; by being the first to study the interaction of rational firms and denialist consumers; and by showing that motivated denial implies welfare gains from prevention subsidies.====The assumption that individuals choose their beliefs is an “as if” representation of denial. Evidence suggests that individuals arrive at their desired beliefs through a myriad of processes, including biased recall, self-deception, the manipulation of evidence and selective information processing (see Bénabou and Tirole (2016) for a review). Since the model's main predictions are driven by the incentives to hold biased beliefs (i.e. the demand for beliefs), they are likely to apply under more elaborate assumptions about how people arrive at them (i.e. the supply of beliefs).====The next section discusses the stylized empirical facts my model seeks to capture and reviews related papers in psychology and behavioral economics. I set the model up in Section 3 and derive its main results in Section 4. Section 5 features two extensions to the model. First, I analyse contexts in which, contrary to the baseline model, anxiety may induce the agent to invest in prevention. This allows me to ask when policy initiatives, such as the use of emotive warning labels, may backfire. Second, I follow Bénabou and Tirole (2002) by introducing present bias and the possibility of defensive pessimism into the model.

We also find that competition in the equity market makes a buyout by one of the two firms more profitable to a research biotech than to a clinical services unit, and can stimulate early-stage investments. However, this long-term incentive can be minimal, notably if the superior efficiency of outsourced operations originates from economies of scope that can hardly be exploited when a firm takes control of the external unit exclusively for itself. R&D outsourcing thus does not always qualify as a relevant pathway to address the declining productivity in innovation that has characterized the industry over several decades.","A decline in R&D (research and development) productivity has been observed in the biopharmaceutical industry over several decades (Munos, 2009, Pammolli et al., 2011). While the number of new molecular entities and biologics that are approved annually by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has remained around the same level since 1950, when measured per billion US dollars spent on R&D this number has halved roughly every 9 years (Scannell et al., 2012). The scale of the productivity problem can be gauged by considering changes in the average full cost estimate of bringing a new compound to the market. This estimate is $451 million in DiMasi et al. (1991), $1031 million in DiMasi et al. (2003), and $2558 million in DiMasi et al. (2016).====There is also evidence that pharmaceutical companies that engage in internal R&D increasingly outsource specific tasks: “The global drug discovery outsourcing market was USD 14.9 billion (2014) and is expected to reach USD 25 billion by 2018, while the market for CRO [contract research organization]-conducted clinical trials was USD 23.1 billion (2014) and is expected to increase to USD 35.8 billion by 2020” (Schuhmacher et al., 2016, p. 8). It is believed in the industry that R&D outsourcing can reduce costs by increasing efficiency in the discovery and testing steps toward new medicines (e.g., Taylor et al., 2016, Sancheti et al., 2018). On the demand side of the R&D market, the tasks that pharmaceutical companies choose to contract out cover a large range of activities, including target validation, genetic engineering, chemical synthesis, compound screening, lead compounds evaluation, preclinical studies, and clinical (in-human) trials. On the supply side, science-based biotech firms specialize in early-stage research activities for the discovery of new chemical or biological molecules, while CROs deliver later-stage development services for the safety and efficacy assessment of drug or vaccine candidates.====Despite the observed decline in R&D productivity, as gross margins in medication markets have evolved in parallel with R&D spending, the net profit returns in the biopharmaceutical industry have remained persistently high at the aggregated level since the early 1960s (Scherer, 2001, Scherer, 2010). However, the average profitability of biotech units that specialize in the discovery of new treatments or preventives has remained low since the emergence of genetic engineering in the 1970s (Pisano, 2006a, Pisano, 2010). Biotech firms also face greater financial risk and are more sensitive to policy shocks that affect expected future profitability than the average large pharmaceutical company (Golec and Vernon, 2009). A recent empirical analysis of a comprehensive sample of 1066 companies in the period 1930–2015 confirms these observations by disaggregating the financial performance across the pharmaceutical and biotech subsectors: “[o]ur empirical results show that investments in the pharmaceutical industry have outperformed the broader stock market over a long period of time, whereas investments in the biotech industry have underperformed the market” (Thakor et al., 2017, p. 1154), and the performance differential appears especially pronounced after 2001. Moreover, by decomposing the risk of the pharma and biotech portfolios into factors arising from general economic conditions (systematic risk) and factors that are unique to the individual company or project (idiosyncratic risk), it is found that the majority of the total risk for the pharmaceutical subsector is of the systematic type while, in contrast, “the biotech portfolio has both systematic risk and idiosyncratic risk, with a much higher idiosyncratic risk than in the pharma portfolio” (p. 1153). Moreover, the systematic risk in biotech firms is as large as – and in some periods can even be substantially higher than – that of the pharma companies. The latter empirical analysis does not include the subsector of CROs involved in the clinical assessment of drug or vaccine candidates. For these organizations, business information abounds that describes more favourable financial conditions, such as “high visibility of revenues, excess cash generation, strong balance sheets and limited exposure to a number of risks that commonly affect biopharma companies…” (Bali et al., 2013, p. 3). As a consequence, unlike biotech firms, “CROs have historically traded at a 21% premium to the S&P 500 over the past 14 years” (Wilson et al., 2016, p. 41).====How does the distribution of industry profits among pharma companies, biotech firms, and CROs, relate to the functioning of the R&D market? Can technological characteristics of contracted-out operations explain the low average profitability of biotech units, and the higher financial returns of CROs? Are the risks inherent to discovery and clinical development activities mitigated by outsourcing contracts? What are the consequences for early-stage investment incentives? In order to answer these questions, we draw on documented characteristics of the biopharmaceutical industry to construct a model in which a for-profit upstream external unit (e.g., a biotech startup, or a contract research organization) conducts specific R&D tasks as solicited non-cooperatively by two downstream firms (big pharma), which also run R&D operations internally before competing in a final market. The external unit interacts with the two firms by responding to their contract offers, and can choose to serve both firms, only one, or none. The firms can substitute internal resources for some or all of the external unit's operations, and their contract offers reflect multi-stage strategic interactions in the intermediate R&D market and in the final product market. Overall, the formal analysis leads to new insights on the functioning of R&D outsourcing and its implications for biopharmaceutical firms and their external partners, with strong and intelligible connections to the recent empirical evidence on the relation between contracted-out and in-house technological activities, on the nature of knowledge externalities in discovery and (distinctively) clinical development, and on merger activity in the equity market.====More specifically, our main results establish simple conditions on the model primitives for the total equilibrium R&D benefits to be either fully appropriated by the two firms, or partially retained by the external unit. These conditions, which can explain the persistently low average profitability of biotech firms, relate to indirect and direct technological externalities. There are ==== technological externalities if the cost of R&D, as conducted by the external unit for the two firms, reflects economies or diseconomies of scope. There are ==== technological externalities if some of the knowledge received or produced by a firm impacts the gross profit of its competitor. We connect the sign and magnitude of these externalities with the distribution of profits among participants in the intermediate market for R&D.====Situations of positive indirect (through the external unit) and direct (inter-firm) externalities correspond mainly to early-stage discovery activities, in which biotech units are typically involved, and where economies of scope across research projects and significant inter-firm knowledge spillovers have been evidenced in the empirical literature (Henderson and Cockburn, 1996).==== In the theoretical context of our model, we find that the external unit exactly breaks even, and hence investors have no positive incentive to engage financial resources, precisely in circumstances where outsourcing the tasks of the most fundamental nature can reduce the costs of discovering new medicines. We also demonstrate that downstream firms can use ==== contract offers in order to transfer – at least partly – the burden of unfavorable realizations of uncertainty to the external unit, via adjusted payments. With an expected payoff at the upstream stage equal to zero, an unfavorable realization of uncertainty then implies a negative return, and thus possibly leads the external unit to shut down, although its activities generate a positive – and possibly very high – industry profit. This (intermediate) market failure outcome suggests that protection measures for the external unit (e.g., a lower bound to milestone payments in case of adverse events) can be necessary to avoid the abandonment of socially valuable research projects.====However, in our model, when an aggregate measure of technological externalities is negative, the external unit can appropriate a positive share of total profits that can be derived analytically. In that case the downstream firms earn only their marginal contribution to the industry value, and the payoff to the external unit depends on the magnitude of externalities. This situation is consistent with the empirical studies that identify diseconomies of scope and nonexistent spillovers in the late-phase clinical trials of candidate drugs (Danzon et al., 2005, Macher and Boerner, 2006), such as conducted by specialized CROs. Then the positive profit to the external unit is an effect of competition between the contract offers of the two firms for the orientation of R&D resources toward specific needs. The intensity of that competition depends on the nature of R&D activities – as conducted by the external unit and by the two firms – and then on the effect of these activities on downstream cost and demand characteristics, which in the end also impact final market interactions.====We also connect the technological conditions that drive the distribution of R&D benefits to the firms’ incentives to participate in the equity market, where big pharma companies acquire specialized innovative units involved in promising research or clinical development programs. For example, in the oncology domain, AbbVie agreed to buy Pharmacyclics for $21 billion in 2015, and Pfizer acquired Medivation for $14 billion in 2016. Such acquisitions, which substitute for contractual outsourcing relations, are viewed by industry leaders as another response to the declining R&D productivity problem (Comanor and Scherer, 2013). Still the high transaction prices observed in the equity market suggest that pharmaceutical firms pay more for R&D by acquiring an external unit than by contracting with it as a partner, or by carrying out the R&D internally (Pisano, 2015). Acquisitions usually conclude a bidding contest where several big pharma rivals compete for the same buyout target,==== leading to equity valuations often considered excessive by industry analysts and experts.====Two categories of cases are identified that depend on the ability of firms to bid or not for the external unit, in relation to financial, managerial, or governance constraints of all kinds. If such constraints are binding, either positive technological externalities dominate and the firms remain independent, or negative externalities lead the firms to choose to coordinate horizontally their R&D outsourcing (as in Majewski, 2004). Otherwise, should the firms be unable to commit to ==== unilaterally considering vertical integration, one of them does acquire the external unit. Whether one or the other firm is the acquirer occurs with equiprobability, independently of firm asymmetries. The main outcome is that the competition for the control of the external unit leads to overbidding (an issue discussed in Higgins and Rodriguez, 2006), although the premium can be nil in the case of negative externalities (diseconomies of scope and inexistant inter-firm spillovers), as characteristic of late-stage development tasks. We thus obtain that biotech founders engaged in early-stage research – more than owners of contract research organizations – may reappropriate in the equity market part of the value transferred to their sponsors in the R&D market.====Our formal analysis relates to a stream of theoretical papers – starting with Aghion and Tirole (1994), Anton and Yao (1994), Bhattacharya and Guriev, 2006, Bhattacharya and Guriev, 2013 – which investigate a variety of issues that pertain to R&D outsourcing, although most models in that stream of literature==== adopt a general approach with no specific reference to the biopharmaceutical domain. Our approach is complementary to recent analyses by Spulber (2013) and Allain et al. (2015) that characterize the connection between the intensity of downstream competition – which depends on the number of client firms – and upstream incentives to engage in R&D operations. As in Spulber (2013), in our model an appropriability problem may lead to integrate R&D and production vertically, and as in Allain et al. (2015) the vertical division of labor in R&D operations is driven by the nature of competition among client firms. A distinctive feature of our model is that the intensity of competition is a consequence of the exact effects of external and internal R&D operations on cost and demand conditions. We also share with Ho (2009) and Lai et al. (2009) the assumption that the downstream firms write contract offers, to which the external unit responds, and which can lead to multi-contracting. Moreover, in our model the firms condition their payments on a measure of the external unit's operations, as in Vencatachellum and Versaevel (2009). It follows that the external unit's operations are ==== conducted ==== the client firms’ choice of payment schemes, consistently with contractual situations in the biopharmaceutical context. These payment schemes are the firms’ instruments that determine the equilibrium distribution of industry profit among contracting parties.====As the firms’ non-cooperative choices of payment schemes depend on technological characteristics of R&D activities, our model specifications also relate to the empirical evidence on the existence of economies of scale or scope in early-stage research and later-stage clinical development. By using data collected at the firm level and at the level of individual R&D projects, Henderson and Cockburn (1996) find economies of scope and significant knowledge spillovers in early-stage drug “discovery” tasks (those on which biotech units typically focus). Conversely, Danzon et al. (2005) and Macher and Boerner (2006) identify diseconomies of scope and nonexistent spillovers in the late-phase clinical trials of candidate medicines (the “development” activities that are usually outsourced to specialized CROs). Our main theoretical propositions clearly echo these contrasted empirical results, and show their relevance for explaining the distribution of industry profits between an external unit and its client firms.====The paper is organized as follows. Characteristics of the biopharmaceutical industry are presented in Section 2, in connection to the model specifications introduced in Section 3. The distribution of industry profits is characterized in Section 4, and incentives to shift to a more integrated structure are investigated in Section 5. Final remarks are in Section 6.

The insurer developed a claims-based algorithm to derive a member-level healthcare utilization risk score. Members with the highest scores were contacted by a care management team tasked with closing gaps in care. The number of members outreached was dictated by resource availability and not by severity, creating a set of arbitrary cutoff points, separating treated and untreated members with very similar predicted risk scores. Using a regression discontinuity approach, we find evidence that predictive analytics-driven interventions directed at high-risk individuals reduced emergency room and specialist visits, yet not hospitalizations.","The distribution of healthcare spending in the U.S. is highly skewed, with 21% of spending concentrated among the top 1% of spenders and nearly 50% of spending concentrated among the top 5% of spenders (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2010). A large body of literature shows that Medicare recipients consume a disproportionate share of health care services (Card, et al. 2009; Finkelstein, 2007; Niska et al., 2010). While people over age 64 in 2009 comprised 13% of the US population, they made up 38.2% of the top 5% and 40% of the top 1% of highest spenders (NIHCM Foundation Data Brief, 2012). Even among Medicare recipients, the driver of hospitalizations and ED visits are patients with chronic conditions such as congestive heart failure (AHRQ, 2013). To reduce unnecessary and preventable care, the fast-changing healthcare landscape is often characterized by a shift from fee-for-service with an emphasis on volume to a value-based reimbursement structure (Miller, 2009). To thrive in this new environment, providers must be proactive as opposed to reactive (i.e. anticipate problems before they arise versus be there to escalate care when an individual patient’s condition deteriorates). Similarly, insurance providers are interested in reducing preventable hospitalizations and shifting expensive emergency department (ED) visits to the primary care setting. One such proactive clinical decision-making approach entails the use of real time risk stratification of their patient population to close gaps in care and therefore prevent costly and potentially unnecessary service use (Bates et al., 2014).====The effort to contain cost, improve care quality and reduce wasteful care, by improving access to primary and preventive care has received attention in the literature. Cost and downstream healthcare utilization were influenced by a focus on population health management and continuity of care (Dusheiko et al., 2011; Kranker, 2016) as well as improved access to care (Alexander et al., 2017; Dobkin et al., 2016; Finkelstein et al., 2012; Taubman et al., 2014; Miller, 2012). Opportunities for closing gaps in care through enhanced coordination are likely large among the Medicare population. The typical Medicare beneficiary receives care from eight distinct providers per year while the top decile has seen over 21 providers per year (Agha et al., 2017). Care fragmentation is especially damaging for chronically ill patients and have led to adverse health outcomes (McWilliams, 2016; Milstein and Gibertson, 2009).====Most individuals, even those at high risk, are not medically supervised around the clock. Therefore, the ability to maintain an active lifestyle, balanced diet, medication adherence, and escalate care in the face of sudden health changes is essential for successful disease management. In a way, if the member is not very efficient in interpreting health signals and turning them into health actions, preemptive interventions by third party payers with access to detailed individual level data can strengthen the connection between observing certain health signals and effectively acting on them. Put differently, data-driven claims-based analysis can serve to raise the probability of healthy, cost-lowering, and quality enhancing choices for patients.====To our knowledge, this is the first evaluation of an intervention designed to improve care coordination and close gaps in care in a high-risk chronic population that was driven by a preemptive, data-driven, claims-based analysis. We utilize data from an insurer-driven intervention to reduce hospital and emergency department utilization among their fully-insured Medicare Advantage member population who were diagnosed with Congestive Heart Failure (CHF). Efforts to reduce healthcare utilization for Medicare CHF patients has the potential of leading to significant savings for the insurer and increase well-being for their members. The annual cost of avoidable or preventable hospitalizations and emergency room visits surpasses 25 billion dollars per year (AHRQ, 2004). There are more than 1 million CHF hospitalizations annually, with over 70% of hospitalizations in the Medicare population (NCHS Data Brief, 2012), and CHF accounted for 21.1% of all potentially avoidable hospitalizations in 2009 (Segal et al., 2014).====The insurer utilized a proprietary algorithm to derive a risk score for each member based on patterns of healthcare consumption, medication use, demographic characteristics, and additional proprietary member experience data from different sources. The higher the risk score, the more likely the member is to experience gaps in care and be at risk for hospitalization. A designated care coordination management team was tasked with identifying and closing gaps in care by contacting members with relatively high-risk scores. However, members were not chosen for treatment based on an absolute level of risk, but rather the care management team’s resource availability determined how many members they could reach out to. Every time the algorithm was run it produced a ranking of members and a corresponding set of arbitrary cutoff points for each outreach wave, separating treated and untreated members with very similar predicted risk scores.====This study has two primary aims. First, we assess whether the algorithm-derived risk score is predictive of hospitalizations and ED visits. Second, we use an intent-to-treat approach to estimate the causal effect of the care management intervention on inpatient and outpatient healthcare utilization over time. Here, our main analyses utilize the ad-hoc cutoffs across waves and between treatment and control groups, and rely on a Regression Discontinuity (RD) design that compares individuals above and below the threshold of selection into the outreach program.====We find that the risk score is a strong predictor of hospitalization and ED visits 30, 90, 180 and 360 days after the algorithm was run. Our estimates suggest that the outreach program reduces the number of ED visits across all post treatment periods, and some evidence of a reduction in cardiologist visits. Specifically, we find that the number of outpatient ED visits decreases by about 40% within the first year following treatment. At the same time, while directionally similar, we find little or no statistically significant impact of the outreach program on the number of PCP visits or hospitalizations. Along the extensive margin, we find strong evidence that the probability of having any cardiologist and ED visit decreases sharply. Specifically, we find that in the short- and long-term the probability of having a cardiologist visit decreases by 14 percentage points. We also find stronger effects in the long-run for ED, suggesting that the probability of having an ED visit decreases by 12 percentage points. In terms of PCP visits and hospitalizations, we find no changes in the probability of having such event. We conduct several robustness checks to test the validity of the RD design and sample selection. In all cases, our results are relatively stable and unaffected by the change of specification and bandwidth selection.",The effect of predictive analytics-driven interventions on healthcare utilization,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629618305095,March 2019,2019,Research Article,327.0

We find that UPK increases the probability that a child is diagnosed with asthma or with vision problems, receives ==== for hearing or vision problems, or receives an immunization or screening during the pre-kindergarten year. These effects are not offset by lower rates in the kindergarten year, suggesting that UPK accelerates the rate at which children are identified with and treated for conditions that could potentially delay learning and cause behavioral problems.","A growing body of literature suggests that early childhood education improves lifetime outcomes, especially for disadvantaged children (Heckman, 2011; Muennig, 2015). In response, many states have expanded funding for pre-kindergarten programs. By the 2014–2015 academic year, 42 states and District of Columbia had established state funded pre-K programs serving 4-year-olds. Across the nation 1.2 million 4-year-old children, who account for about 30% of the total population of 4-year-old children, were enrolled in a state funded pre-K program (Barnett et al., 2016).====While evidence for the long-term benefits of preschool is strong, it is more challenging to identify how these benefits are achieved. Many studies find that pre-K programs improve children’s academic skills (literacy, language and math), cognition, and test scores in the short run, but often find these effects fade out over time (Weiland and Yoshikawa, 2013; Gormley and Gayer, 2005; Fitzpartick, 2008; Lipsey et al., 2013; Wong et al., 2008; Cascio and Schanzenbach, 2013; Hill et al., 2015; Gormley et al., 2008). One potential pathway is through the impact of early childhood programs on non-cognitive skills, though the evidence in support of this is equivocal ((Zigler et al., 1994; Janvier et al., 2016) (Magnuson et al., 2007; Baker et al., 2008). There is very little evidence, however, about how UPK programs affect physical health, and particularly aspects of physical health that may be correlated with subsequent school performance, such as vision (D’Onise et al., 2010). This is surprising because most early childhood programs include some form of physical health screening or a co-located medical provider in their designs.====In this paper, we focus on the potential of UPK to address physical health conditions, and, in particular, identify and address sensory problems (such as vision deficits) early. Vision problems are prevalent among children in poor urban environments (Gould and Gould, 2003), are correlated with low academic performance and subsequent well-being (Krumholtz, 2000; Polack et al., 2008; Rein et al., 2006), are associated with social and emotional difficulties (Zaba, 2001; Johnson et al., 1996) and are readily addressed through screening and treatment Basch (2011).==== Prior research has likewise suggested that hearing problems may negatively impact academic performance, self-esteem, and social functioning (Daud et al., 2010; American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2017; Theunissen et al., 2014) and that early intervention is essential for closing the developmental gap (Mellon et al., 2009; Eriks-Brophy et al., 2012). The proactive diagnosis and treatment of vision and hearing problems among pre-K children may provide them with early advantages for succeeding in social environments that in turn shape their lives down the line.====The introduction of universal pre-kindergarten (UPK) in New York City, the nation’s largest school system, offers an opportunity to assess how a highly regulated, standardized UPK program affects health outcomes in the short-run. The substantial size of the program; the design and financing of the program, which suggest that it offers standardized care of relatively high quality, including standardized protocols for screening and follow-up of sensory problems; and the timing of the roll-out make the NYC case a valuable case-study.====As with other US UPK programs, New York’s program is currently voluntary. This means that enrolled children may differ from those whose parents choose other options. An analysis that does not take into account the endogeneity of enrollment (and the difference in children’s age by design) is likely to lead to biased results (Gormley and Gayer, 2005; Lipsey et al., 2015). We exploit two distinct sources of variation to avoid this endogeneity: the introduction of the program and the rules governing eligibility, which use a strict January 1 birthdate cutoff. The introduction of the program provides variation for before-and-after comparisons (as in a first-difference design) and the age cutoff allows us to compare outcomes for children who are just a little too old (young) to be eligible for the program with those for children who are just young (old) enough to be eligible (as in a regression discontinuity design). Each of these sources of variation alone, however, could mask other confounders.====To address these potential biases, we adopt a difference-in-regression-discontinuities design (DRD), coupling the age-cutoff RDD with a difference-in-differences analysis. We identify the effect of UPK as the difference between the estimated effects on health of an RDD around the age cutoff in the year before the UPK expansion and an RDD around the age cutoff in the year after the UPK expansion.====Our study contributes to the literature in several ways. First, while most of the existing literature on UPK programs focuses on school readiness, we examine the effect of UPK on a range of short-run health outcomes during the pre-K year and in the Kindergarten year. We focus on low-income children who are enrolled in Medicaid, a group that is the target for most UPK programs.====,==== Second, the large-scale UPK program in NYC, with clear guidance and regulation, provides us with evidence from a relatively homogenous, regulated-quality program, as well as a large data set. Third, we adopt a difference-in-regression-discontinuities design to identify plausibly causal effects.====We find that the NYC UPK program led to increases in rates of diagnosis of asthma and vision problems, to increased rates of screening for immunization or infectious disease, and to increased rates of treatment of hearing and vision problems. UPK eligibility (attendance) increased the probabilities of being diagnosed with asthma and vision problems by 1.3 (3.8) and 1.9 (5.6) percentage points respectively, which correspond to percentage increases of 9.4% (27.5%) and 18.8% (55.4%) from baselines. UPK eligibility (attendance) also increased the probabilities of receiving treatment of vision and hearing problems and immunization or infectious disease screening by 2.2 (6.5), 0.9 (2.6), and 2.5 (7.4) percentage points respectively, which correspond to percentage increases of 15.3% (45.3%), 21.7% (62.7%), and 6.2% (18.5%).==== Our findings indicate that UPK may accelerate the rate at which children are identified with and treated for conditions that could potentially delay learning and cause behavioral problems.====Our main findings, especially the effects on the diagnosis and treatment of vision problems, are quite consistent across specifications and robust to a series of robustness checks. We find similar results for the further roll-out of UPK in 2015, for children who were just old enough for pre-K, and for children who were just young enough for pre-K. We follow the first UPK cohort into the second academic year after the UPK expansion, when they are in kindergarten. We find that the increased screenings and treatments during the pre-K academic year are not offset by a reduced rate of diagnosis or treatment during the kindergarten year. This implies that our UPK findings reflect more than differences in the timing of screenings associated with school entry -- children eligible for UPK receive both earlier and more treatment for these problems. We show that UPK increases the propensity for children to get timely care after a diagnosis. Getting treatment earlier for vision and hearing problems, which might otherwise interfere with learning and cause behavioral problems, could generate short-run benefits for children development, and might contribute to lifetime benefits as well.",Seeing and hearing: The impacts of New York City’s universal pre-kindergarten program on the health of low-income children,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629618302935,March 2019,2019,Research Article,328.0

We analyze how patient socioeconomic status mediates these responses. We show theoretically that patient socioeconomic status systematically influences the way physicians respond to ==== changes, and we identify the channels through which these effects operate. We use two Medicare reimbursement changes to investigate these insights empirically. We confirm that a given physician facing an increase in reimbursement boosts utilization by more when treating richer patients. We show that average supply price elasticities vary from 0.02 to 0.18 for a given physician, depending on the patient’s socioeconomic status. Finally, we show that the Medicare reforms we study led to overall reimbursement increases that raised healthcare utilization by 10% more for high-income patients compared to their low-income peers.","Economists have long emphasized the peculiarities of healthcare markets, compared to other markets for goods and services. Since at least Kenneth Arrow’s pioneering paper on the subject, economists have recognized two features in particular: the altruism of healthcare providers towards their patients and the reliance of patients on their physicians for information and guidance (Arrow, 1963).====Altruism encourages physicians to faithfully represent their patients’ interests. An altruistic physician will tend to economize on the use of scarce inputs and attempt to improve the well-being of her patients. On the other hand, the informational advantage of physicians creates a classic agency problem that physicians might exploit to pursue their own interests at the expense of their patients’ (for example, Dranove and White, 1987; Blomqvist, 2002; Emanuel and Emanuel, 1992; Mooney and Ryan, 1993; Zweifel et al., 1997). These countervailing incentives produce conflicting implications for pricing. Self-interested physicians will respond to higher prices by performing more procedures. Altruistic physicians, on the other hand, will protect their patients from higher prices by performing fewer procedures. Prior literature has investigated these complex implications of physician altruism on a variety of outcomes, including physician labor supply, patient health, patient treatment plans, responses to reimbursement changes, optimal insurance design, and quality of care (Chone and Ma, 2011; Clemens and Gottlieb, 2014; Dickstein, 2016; Dranove, 1988; Ellis and McGuire, 1990, 1986; Godager and Wiesen, 2013; Jack, 2005; Jacobson et al., 2017; Liu and Ma, 2013; McGuire, 2000; Rochaix, 1989; Glied and Zivin, 2002).====Less attention has been paid to the influence of patient socioeconomic status on physician decision making. Intuitively, if physicians care about patient utility, then factors that affect marginal utility– such as patient wealth and income– might systematically alter how a physician behaves, even for otherwise clinically similar patients. Fig. 1 offers some suggestive evidence of what this might mean empirically.====The figure reports a weighted price index over time for Medicare, alongside an index of utilization by high-income and low-income patients. The price index measures the average change in reimbursements for a fixed basket of procedures that are weighted by the intensity required to perform them. In the wake of rapid acceleration in prices, the utilization of high-income patients appeared to rise more rapidly than that of their low-income counterparts.====In this paper, we investigate theoretically and empirically how patient socioeconomic status influences altruistic physicians facing reimbursement changes. We rely on well-established models of physician behavior to explore how patient socioeconomic status influences physicians when patients face positive cost-sharing. We demonstrate theoretically that there are two components to the effect of socioeconomic status. First, when utilization is held fixed across all patients, physicians’ supply response to higher reimbursements will be larger (i.e., more positive) for richer patients. Richer patients face lower marginal disutility of price increases because of their higher incomes. Thus, on the margin, it is less costly for altruistic physicians to “harvest” higher utilization from these patients. Second, however, differences in utilization across richer and poorer patients always give rise to a countervailing “utilization effect” that we elucidate theoretically. Thus, economic theory predicts that the same physician might respond differently to a price change when treating a richer patient, even holding clinical considerations fixed. The direction of the effect becomes an empirical question of interest.====Empirically, we estimate the effect of patient socioeconomic status on physician supply responses by using two exogenous policy shocks to Medicare payments: the 1997 consolidation of geographic payment regions and the 1999 change in estimation of practice expenses. Our results indicate that a given physician’s supply response is stronger when she treats richer patients. Moreover, the variation in price elasticities matters quantitatively. Within physicians, average price elasticities vary from 0.02 to as high as 0.18, when treating patients in the bottom or top socioeconomic status deciles, respectively. Finally, we estimate that our two exogenous policy shocks increased utilization among high-income patients by 10% more than among low-income patients. This effect accounts for about 53% of the divergence across income groups that we see in Fig. 1.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we investigate the theoretical relationship between patient socioeconomic status and physician supply responses. In Section 3, we discuss the empirical approach for estimating the effects of socioeconomic status on supply responses.

A policy rule in The Netherlands states that low-risk deliveries before week 37 should be supervised by physicians and later deliveries only by midwives with no physician present. This creates large discontinuities in the probability of receiving medical interventions only physicians are allowed to perform. Using a regression discontinuity design, we find that babies born slightly before the week-37 cutoff are significantly less likely to die than babies born slightly later. Our data suggest that physician supervision of birth reduces the likelihood of adverse events such as ==== or emergency C-section. Our results indicate that low-income women benefit from receiving a higher level of medical care even if no explicit risk factors have been recognized, pointing to challenges in identifying all high-risk pregnancies. “Back-of-the-envelope” calculations suggest this additional care is highly cost-effective.","Medical expenditures increased tremendously over the last few decades throughout the entire developed world. In the United States, health care spending in 2016 reached almost 18% of gross domestic product. Most of this increase is attributed to changes in medical technologies (Newhouse, 1992). However, there is substantial heterogeneity in treatment effects across patients (Chandra and Skinner, 2012). As such, decision-makers are debating the possibility of slowing down the growth of medical expenditures by reducing the use of inefficient technologies. One specific policy focus concerns the technology of childbirth and proposes the expanded use of lower-cost physician extenders instead of higher-cost physicians for low-risk patients (Fuchs, 1998). In this paper, we investigate the impact of perinatal medical care on the short-term health of low-income low-risk newborns.====Empirical estimation of the returns to medical treatments is complicated by selection issues. Even among observably low-risk women, those with worse expected birth outcomes usually receive more (intensive) treatments, leading to biased estimates in simple regressions. In order to eliminate this bias, we exploit a policy rule in The Netherlands that provides exogenous variation in the medical care for low-risk deliveries. The Dutch system is unique in its division between the primary care provided by midwives and the secondary care provided by obstetricians (OB/GYN). Low-risk women, i.e., women without known medical risk factors, start their pregnancy under the supervision of a midwife and stay under the supervision of a midwife as long as no risk factors appear. Their delivery is supervised by a midwife, who is prohibited by law from performing any medical intervention. The birth can take place either at home or in a hospital, and in both cases no OB/GYN is present. However, if labor is premature (i.e., before 37 completed gestational weeks), the woman should be referred to an obstetrician. In this case, the OB/GYN supervises the delivery, which always takes place in a hospital. Thus, the “week-37 rule” generates a discontinuity at 37 completed gestational weeks in the medical professional supervising the delivery (OB/GYN instead of midwife) and possibly also in two other important medical inputs: the location of delivery (hospital versus home) and all the medical treatments that physicians are allowed to perform during and immediately after birth (e.g., use of forceps and vacuum, administration of antibiotics).====We investigate the effect of the week-37 rule using a regression discontinuity (RD) design among the sample of low-income mothers, defined as women residing in postal codes in the lowest quartile of average monthly household income.==== There are three reasons for our focus on low-income women. First, the week-37 rule may be more relevant for them because the classification as low- or high-risk may be more error-prone among low socioeconomic status (SES) women. In general, the week-37 rule is most relevant for women (and deliveries) with unrecognized risks: a premature delivery might be life-saving because it will make them end up with the care that they need because of the unrecognized risk. If higher-income women have better health education, are better able to communicate with midwives, and follow their instructions, midwives might be better able to identify higher-income mothers at risk and refer them to an OB/GYN. The week-37 rule would then be of little benefit for them. In contrast, higher rates of unrecognized risks among lower-income women might mean that the extra care provided under the week-37 rule can be beneficial in general, i.e., that low SES may in itself be regarded as a proxy for risk factors. Consistent with this, a survey by the Royal Dutch Organisation of Midwives reports that midwives needed on average 23 percent extra time when caring for low-income women (Buisman and Gerats, 2008). The need for extra time was due to difficulties in collecting relevant (medical) data, additional education on prevention, lifestyles and risk, more frequent home visits, and consultations to exclude uncertainties.====Second, it is a stylized fact that there are significant socioeconomic disparities in the prevalence of prematurity (Institute of Medicine, 2007). Given the increased burden of prematurity on families with lower socioeconomic status, studying the returns to perinatal medical interventions for this group is interesting in its own right.====Finally, the key identification assumption in the RD design requires that individuals do not have precise control over the assignment variable. We exclude induced and stimulated births from our sample, as well as planned C-sections, which are rare within our sample.==== Hence, a manipulation of birth dates with the goal of ending up on a specific side of the cutoff is unlikely in our sample of spontaneous births. Nevertheless, as we will argue later on, physicians may induce births differentially across cutoff and thus excluding induced and stimulated births may lead to a bias toward zero, especially among higher-income women. Correspondingly, we find evidence that the key identification assumption is potentially violated among higher-income births. While the identification assumptions in this RD design are more likely to hold among low-income mothers, it is important to emphasize that they are ultimately not directly testable. Therefore, we devote a significant portion of the results section to discussing their plausibility.====To preview our results, we find that the week-37 rule generates substantial variation in medical care parameters among low-income women with pregnancies classified as low-risk. For example, the probability that a birth is supervised by an obstetrician increases by 28.4 percentage points below the 37-week threshold. Similarly, newborns slightly below the week-37 cutoff are 16.4 percentage points more likely be delivered in a hospital and 4.5 percentage points more likely to be admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). These estimates are economically large and correspond to increases of 23–62% when compared to the mean above the cutoff. Our results also indicate economically large health gains to preterm newborns resulting from the week-37 rule: babies born slightly before 37 completed gestational weeks are significantly less likely to die when compared to newborns who are slightly above the week-37 cutoff. In order to shed some light on the mechanisms behind these health gains, we further examine the presence of discontinuities among a number of health outcomes that are related to the skill of the birth attendant. Our results point to economically large reductions in the likelihood of presence of meconium in amniotic fluid, emergency C-section or birth trauma/perinatal asphyxia (oxygen deprivation). Finally, our “back-of-the-envelope” calculations suggest that the week-37 rule is a highly cost-effective measure. This is especially important in light of the growing emphasis on cost reduction through increased use of physician extenders (Institute of Medicine, 2011).====Our study fits broadly in the previous economics research on returns to medical technologies. A large part of this literature investigates treatments for adults, such as for heart attack (Cutler et al., 1998, Skinner et al., 2006) or HIV/AIDS patients (Duggan and Evans, 2008). More recently, a growing number of papers examine returns to early-life medical interventions, with a special focus on treatments for very low birth weight children. Increased treatments for this group are generally shown to reduce mortality (Cutler and Meara, 2000, Almond et al., 2010, Bharadwaj et al., 2013, Daysal et al., 2018). Research on the returns to medical care for low-risk infants is limited with mixed results. While Almond et al. (2011) show that longer hospital stays do not affect infant health outcomes after uncomplicated deliveries, Miller (2006) finds that midwifery-promoting public policies were associated with lower neonatal mortality.==== Particularly relevant to our study is Daysal et al. (2015), who also use data from The Netherlands and an instrumental variables strategy to find that giving birth in a hospital (as opposed to home) leads to reductions in the mortality of low-risk newborns. The authors provide suggestive evidence that proximity to other medical technologies, such as neonatal intensive care units (NICU), may be an important channel contributing to the health gains from a hospital birth.====Our paper makes several contributions. First, we exploit a new source of variation in perinatal medical treatments that affects children on the borderline of prematurity (37 weeks of gestation). Prematurity is the most important cause of death within the first month of life and it ranks as the second cause of all deaths for children under 5 (March of Dimes et al., 2012). Focusing on the understudied group of premature children on the borderline of prematurity yields widely relevant findings because “[o]n a global level, given their relatively larger numbers, babies born at 34 to 36 weeks are likely to have the greatest public health impact and to be of the most importance in the planning of services.” (March of Dimes et al., 2012, p. 30)====Second, our results suggest that ensuring access to additional medical care may improve newborn outcomes even among low-risk women living in a developed country. The Netherlands is a country where maternity care is provided using a rigorous process of risk selection based on past medical history, the current health status of the mother and the fetus, and their development throughout pregnancy. Yet, even with a relatively sophisticated model of risk selection, we find that the babies of some women classified as low-risk benefit from the additional medical treatments provided by obstetricians in a hospital.",Low-risk isn’t no-risk: Perinatal treatments and the health of low-income newborns,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629617305313,March 2019,2019,Research Article,330.0

Using a unique policy change and administrative data from Switzerland, I show that medical review reduces DI incidence by 23%. Incidence reductions are closely tied to difficult-to-diagnose conditions, suggesting inaccurate assessments by treating physicians. Due to a partial benefit system, reductions in full benefit awards are partly offset by increases in partial benefits. More intense screening also increases labor market participation. Existing benefit recipients are downgraded and lose part of their benefit income when scheduled medical reviews occur. Back-of-the-envelope calculations indicate that external medical review is highly cost-effective. Under additional assumptions, the results provide a lower bound of the effect on the false positive award error rate.","Targeted programs constitute the most common form of social protection worldwide. Benefit payments are disbursed to groups identified by a common characteristic—families, the unemployed or persons with a work-limiting disability. Among the different social programs, disability insurance (DI) is by far the most costly. The average OECD country spends about 2.3% of GDP on disability-related benefits (OECD, 2010). In both the United States and Europe, the number of DI beneficiaries has been rising throughout the late 20th and early 21st century and recently stabilized on a high level—on average about 6% of the working age population in OECD countries receive disability benefits (OECD, 2010). Increases in DI beneficiaries have often been associated with imperfect screening of DI applicants (e.g. Autor and Duggan, 2003). One indication for this is that the relative prevalence of difficult-to-diagnose health conditions like musculoskeletal or mental health problems on the DI rolls has increased at a higher rate than prevalence in the general population (Campolieti, 2002, OECD, 2010). Across OECD countries, 60% of DI inflow can be attributed to muscoloskeletal conditions or mental health claims (OECD, 2009).====Disability benefit decisions are made based on medical assessments of individuals’ residual functional capacity, i.e., their remaining ability to work. However, the medical assessment process required for eligibility determination differs across countries. In 40% of the OECD countries surveyed in OECD (2003), the first gatekeeper to the DI system is the treating physician. In Norway, Switzerland and the United States—countries which are characterized by high rates of DI prevalence—treating physician testimony has historically often been decisive for claims decisions. Treating physicians also hold an influential role in the DI determination process in Australia, Denmark, Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. In these DI systems, the treating physician submits the medical documentation of applicants’ diagnosis and treatment history to the DI administration. After submission, the documentation is reviewed by caseworkers—and potentially also by DI physicians.====Whether treating physicians or DI-appointed physicians alone should assess residual functional capacity of DI applicants remains an open question. Treating physicians are considered to have an informational advantage, hence their recommendation is often influential in award decisions. The United States Social Security Administration (SSA) even adopted a ‘treating physician rule’ in 1991, giving ‘controlling weight’ to the treating physician's opinion. At the same time, treating physicians are known to diagnose clients favorably in the context of sick-listing, possibly to prevent harming a long-standing physician-patient relationship (e.g. Zinn and Furutani, 1996, Englund et al., 2000, Kankaanpää et al., 2012). Moreover, treating physicians are often general practitioners and not clinical specialists, and it is unclear whether complex disabling conditions can be accurately diagnosed by treating physicians. For these reasons, treating physicians’ assessments are commonly subjected to ==== by DI physicians, who are often clinical specialists.====This paper evaluates the effectiveness of external medical review and its implications. Identification relies on quasi-experimental policy variation generated by an extensive pilot program that preceded the nationwide introduction of mandatory medical review in Switzerland. For the analysis, I develop a combined difference-in-differences and spatial matching approach, embedded in an age-based duration analysis framework for estimation. The results indicate that introducing medical review reduces DI admissions by 23%. Reductions are closely tied to psychological and musculoskeletal conditions, diseases which are more prone to inaccurate diagnoses. Medical review also increases labor market participation. In an extension to the main analysis, I provide explicit identifying conditions under which the inflow reduction can be interpreted as a bound on the reduction in DI award errors. Looking at the stock, I find that existing benefit recipients are downgraded and lose part of their benefit income when scheduled medical reviews occur. Finally, I demonstrate that medical review is highly cost effective.====In 2005, external medical review became mandatory for all DI applications in Switzerland. This reform was preceded by a pilot, which introduced mandatory medical review in several Swiss cantons already in 2002. Medical review in this context means file-based review, exchange with treating physicians and personal examinations by official DI and other third-party physicians. The reform had three major components. First, it substantially increased the medical staff and funding directed towards reviewing DI applicants’ cases, more than doubling the number of full-time equivalent staff positions. Screening quality was improved by substantially reducing the individual DI physicians’ caseload and by directing cases to physicians’ specialized in the relevant field. Second, the physicians are mandated to review all DI applications, to conduct medical checks if required and to provide the responsible DI caseworker with better information about applicants’ health. Before the policy change, caseworkers relied on information provided by applicants’ treating physicians for their decision, as the DI offices had insufficient resources to screen individuals. Third, the policy also abolished legal obstacles that prevented DI physicians from examining applicants in person or requesting further documentation. Meanwhile, the decision structure remains unchanged, the final eligibility decision remains with the responsible DI caseworker.====This paper contributes to the literature on screening in DI by investigating medical review, a form of screening which has so far been largely neglected. DI screening involves two distinct aspects: ==== and ====. Interestingly, while screening has received considerable attention in the literature on DI, studies on screening in DI almost exclusively focus on variations in screening stringency and use them to obtain a control group to identify the disincentive effect of DI on labor supply (e.g. Karlström et al., 2008, Mitra, 2009, de Jong et al., 2011, Staubli, 2011, Maestas et al., 2013, French and Song, 2014). These studies rely on either explicit or implicit changes to eligibility criteria and the admittance threshold for identification and generally find positive labor supply effects of screening. For example, de Jong et al. (2011), Maestas et al. (2013) and French and Song (2014) rely on variations in adjudicator stringency, while Karlström et al. (2008) and Staubli (2011) rely on explicit policy reforms that limited eligibility for certain groups. Looking at DI in Austria, Staubli (2011) shows that stricter eligibility requirements both reduce insurance prevalence and increase labor supply. Naturally, these studies also often find lower take-up rates of DI because individuals become mechanically ineligible for DI due to changes in the admittance criteria.====In this paper, I focus on the implications of medical review, an intervention that influences screening quality by providing more information on individuals’ underlying capacity to work. Looking at medical review allows abstracting from mechanical inflow effects which arise due to implicit eligibility requirement changes. Unlike stringency changes, medical review does not inherently involve a trade-off between false positive and false negative decision errors (e.g. Kleven and Kopczuk, 2011, Low and Pistaferri, 2015). Since medical review is primarily targeting new DI applicants, I focus explicitly on insurance ==== (inflow) in the analysis, since ==== (stock) is likely to be more inert. In addition, research has shown that inducing work take-up among long-term beneficiaries can be difficult and results regarding the employment capabilities of this group are mixed (e.g. Kornfeld and Rupp, 2000, Adam et al., 2010, Borghans et al., 2014, Bütler et al., 2015, Moore, 2015, Garcia Mandico et al., 2018).====Moreover, the results in this paper also relate to the findings of health condition-dependent effect heterogeneity in the literature on disincentive effects of DI and the literature on misreporting of health status. In a seminal paper, Bound (1989) finds that up to half of DI recipients in the US would be working in the absence of DI. Newer studies have confirmed Bound's (1989) main result, but also show that there is considerable effect heterogeneity (e.g. Chen and van der Klaauw, 2008, von Wachter et al., 2011, Maestas et al., 2013, French and Song, 2014). Results by von Wachter et al. (2011) indicate that especially employment of younger individuals and those who applied based on mental health and muscoloskeletal conditions would be non-negligible in the absence of DI. Related to this, Campolieti (2006) notes that stricter DI entry requirements cause fewer reports of these difficult-to-diagnose conditions among older males.==== Using administrative records, I show that medical screening reduces insurance inflow of difficult-to-diagnose conditions and increases labor market participation. This effectively ties excess inflow of individuals capable of working to certain conditions and suggests that medical review is a cost-effective policy to reduce it.====Finally, an extensive theoretical literature investigates the implications of imperfect tagging in social insurances. Since disability status is private information, it is inferred by the insurance with error. The seminal work by Akerlof (1978) has been extended to include two-sided classification errors and applied to the DI context by Sheshinski (1978), Parsons (1996) and Kleven and Kopczuk (2011), among others. Few empirical studies have attempted to estimate the size of classification errors directly. Given auxiliary assumptions, the results in this paper provide a tentative lower bound estimate of the effect of medical review on the false positive classification error rate in these models. In addition, the results suggest that award errors most likely exceed rejection errors, a finding that diverges from the results for the US. Although not an exact quantification, these results, unlike earlier studies, do not rely on small sample expert reviews and the assumption of subsample perfect classification (Nagi, 1969, Smith and Lilienfeld, 1971) or a comparison with self-reported disability status (Benitez-Silva et al., 2004).====Taken together, many results in the paper are also closely related to the findings by Low and Pistaferri (2015), who analyze the trade-off between incentives and insurance in DI using a life-cycle model. Among other results, they find that false acceptances exist especially among individuals with moderate limitations, which can be related to the result that medical review is especially effective for soft, difficult-to-diagnose health conditions, which are only partially work limiting. Since welfare effects in their model are dominated by coverage for the severely work-limited, they pose whether allowing for partial disability and partial benefits may be a way to reduce incentive costs. While I cannot make a statement about costs relative to a binary DI system, my results are obtained within a partial benefit system, indicating that incentive costs still matter with partial classifications and that misclassification is a question of degree.====In sum, the paper provides three distinct contributions. First, I show that medical review is cost-effective in reducing and downgrading inflow of DI recipients. Second, I demonstrate that reductions are exclusively tied to difficult-to-diagnose conditions. Together with the fact that screening increases labor supply, this suggests a combination of inaccurate diagnoses by treating physicians and possible moral hazard on the side of applicants. Third, I provide explicit conditions under which the inflow reduction implied by the reduced-form estimate can be interpreted as a net reduction in DI award errors.====The paper proceeds as follows: The next section discusses the institutional setting and the role of medical screening in DI, Section 3 introduces the data, Section 4 covers identification and estimation methods, Section 5 discusses the results and Section 6 concludes.",Does external medical review reduce disability insurance inflow?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629618303783,March 2019,2019,Research Article,331.0

We measure attitudes toward correlation and attitudes toward higher order dependence structures such as cross-prudence and cross-temperance, making use of the risk apportionment technique proposed by Eeckhoudt et al. (2007). For multivariate gains, we find correlation aversion and cross-prudence in longevity and wealth. For losses, we observe correlation seeking and cross-imprudence. We do not find clear evidence for cross-temperance. Our results indicate that longevity and wealth are considered to be substitutes for gains, but not for losses. Second, univariate (higher order) risk preferences are comparable for longevity and wealth, although somewhat closer to linearity for wealth. Third, we find evidence that attitudes toward dependence structures in the health domain are sign-dependent.","Health and health care are surrounded by a lot of uncertainty, both in terms of diagnostic and treatment risk, risk of future diseases, and financial risks. As a result, it is widely recognized that risk preferences are an important determinant of health-related decisions. The recent theoretical literature has shown that many health-related behaviors in unidimensional settings should not only be governed by ====, but that the higher order risk preferences ==== and ==== complement risk aversion in important ways (Courbage and Rey, 2006; Felder and Mayrhofer, 2014; Pauker, 2014).==== Intuitively, prudence governs how optimal behavior changes in the presence of a background risk, while temperance determines whether independent zero-mean risks should be aggregated or not (see Section 2 for details). For example, in the wealth domain, agents who are prudent and temperate should save more, but should invest fewer of these savings in risky assets, than those who are neither prudent nor temperate (e.g. Eeckhoudt and Schlesinger, 2006; Gollier and Pratt, 1996; Kimball, 1990). In the case of health, Courbage and Rey (2006) observe that the level of prudence is a main determinant of the optimal level of prevention for health risks, while Felder and Mayrhofer (2014) show that prudence and temperance affect optimal medical test and treatment decisions. As a result, Pauker (2014) advocates that the study of higher order risk attitudes should receive priority on the research agenda of medical decision making.====Many health-related decisions are, however, not unidimensional; they are taken in the presence of other – often uncontrollable and undiversifiable – risks. For instance, the decision to purchase health insurance typically involves both health and wealth related risks, and the treatment of a particular disease may involve multiple independent health risks (comorbidities). Recent theoretical literature has shown that decisions in these multidimensional settings are not only driven by univariate risk preferences, but also by the multivariate risk preferences ====, ==== and ==== by governing the interaction of univariate risk preferences for different attributes (Bleichrodt et al., 2003a; Dardanoni and Wagstaff, 1990; Ebert and van de Kuilen, 2018; Eeckhoudt et al., 2007; Rey and Rochet, 2004).====Taking health status and wealth as attributes, correlation aversion implies that the individual prefers to disaggregate fixed reductions in health and wealth, suggesting that, under expected utility (EU), the marginal utility of wealth increases as individuals become less healthy. If given a choice, a correlation averse individual would thus rather be rich in the state of the world in which she is sick than in the state in which she is healthy. Consequently, Eeckhoudt et al. (2007) show that a correlation averse individual whose health is declining over time will be inclined to save more in a simple two-period saving model. This is because the higher future wealth level allows her to better cope with the decline in health state.====Cross-prudence for health and wealth implies that the individual can better cope with the “pain” of facing a health risk when she has more wealth (and vice versa). As a result, an individual who is cross-prudent in health will spend more resources on preventive tertiary care if her future wealth risk increases (Eeckhoudt et al., 2007). Finally, an individual who is cross-temperate for health and wealth prefers to disaggregate health and wealth related risks over different states of nature (see Section 2 for details).====Despite the importance of multivariate risk preferences for health-related behaviors from a theoretical perspective, there is surprisingly little empirical evidence regarding the prevalence of multivariate risk preferences in the health domain. In this study, we report the results of an experiment designed to elicit multi- and univariate higher order risk attitudes for health (longevity) and wealth, using the risk apportionment method introduced by Eeckhoudt et al. (2007). The main strength of this method is that it identifies multivariate risk preferences in a model-free way, i.e., without having to assume that individuals maximize a particular preference model such as EU. This is especially important given the fact that EU has often been found to fail as an accurate descriptive model of decision making in the health domain (e.g. Bleichrodt and Pinto, 2000; Bleichrodt et al., 2001; Loomes and McKenzie, 1989). Another strength of the measurement method is that is based on direct choices between two lotteries, making it well-suited for experimentation.====We make the following contributions to the literature on risk preferences in the health domain. First, we contribute to the fast-emerging literature on higher order risk preferences (e.g. Deck and Schlesinger, 2014, 2018; Ebert and van de Kuilen, 2018; Ebert and Wiesen, 2014; Noussair et al., 2014; see Trautmann and van de Kuilen, 2018 for an overview). Only Krieger and Mayrhofer (2012) have elicited higher order risk attitudes in a health context, where they observed risk aversion and prudence. Krieger and Mayrhofer (2012) used monetary outcomes to proxy suffering from a disease. The advantage of this approach is that real incentives can be used, but the downside of the approach is that it is invalid if subjects value being ill and receiving less money differently. For this reason – and to avoid combining real incentives for one attribute with hypothetical incentives for another – we use hypothetical outcomes for wealth and longevity in this study. An advantage of this approach is that we are able to investigate higher order risk preferences in the health domain for significant outcomes. Although it is common practice in experimental economics to adopt a real incentive scheme, there is evidence suggesting there are no systematic differences in the results obtained with hypothetical incentives compared to real incentives for monetary outcomes (e.g., Abdellaoui et al., 2011; Bardsley et al., 2009; Cohen et al., 2016).====Second, we provide model-free direct evidence on whether individuals exhibit a nonlinear preference toward correlation for wealth and health (longevity). Several papers have investigated attitudes toward correlation for wealth and health indirectly by estimating the interaction between the marginal utility of wealth and health status, finding mixed evidence (Brown et al., 2015; Domeij and Johannesson, 2006; Edwards, 2008; Evans and Viscusi, 1991; Finkelstein et al., 2013; Gyrd-Hansen, 2016; Lillard and Weiss, 1997; Sloan et al., 1998; Tengstam, 2014; Viscusi and Evans, 1990). Other papers have investigated attitudes toward correlation between longevity and health states, generally finding correlation seeking for chronic health states, e.g., people typically prefer to live either long without pain or short with pain rather than living long with pain or short without pain (e.g. Pliskin et al., 1980; Wakker, 2010). We take longevity and wealth as attributes and use a model-free approach, i.e., without assuming that individual maximize a particular preference model such as EU.====Third, we provide the first empirical measurements of the prevalence of cross-prudence and cross-temperance for longevity and wealth in our sample. As shown by Eeckhoudt et al., (2007), saving behavior in the presence of health risks is determined by these risk traits. In a survey of retired individuals, Edwards (2008) found indirect evidence for cross-temperance for wealth and health by observing that the proportion of risky financial assets held by respondents’ decreases with increases in perceived future health risk. We are the first to test this conjecture directly in a controlled environment without making the assumption that individuals maximize EU.====Fourth, we investigate whether higher order risk preferences for longevity and multivariate risk preferences for longevity and wealth are sign-dependent. Previous literature has shown that attitudes towards risk depend crucially on whether outcomes are in the gain or in the loss domain (Tversky and Kahneman, 1992). Several recent papers have studied the robustness of higher order risk preferences toward framing of the outcomes (Deck and Schlesinger, 2010; Ebert and van de Kuilen, 2018; Ebert and Wiesen, 2011; Maier and Rüger, 2011). The common finding of prudence and temperance for wealth appears to be robust to such framing effects. In most of these studies however, subjects are asked to apportion either improvements (gains) or reductions (losses) across equally likely states of nature. The final outcomes of the lotteries are kept constant by manipulating the initial endowment from/to which these reductions or improvements are added/subtracted. As noticed by Bleichrodt and van Bruggen (2018), this manipulation does not affect the reference point of subjects if one uses the expected value of a lottery, the maximum of the minimum outcomes of a lottery, or the status quo as a reference point. The fact that these studies did not replicate the commonly found risk aversion for gains and risk seeking for losses for moderate probabilities, indeed suggests that these studies did not induce a shift in the reference point. Bleichrodt and van Bruggen (2018) do observe sign-dependence for prudence preferences in a setting where outcomes are framed as reductions or improvements compared to a (salient) initial endowment. We investigate whether multivariate risk preferences toward wealth and longevity are sign-dependent by considering the apportionment of reductions and improvements of wealth and longevity, while keeping initial endowments constant.==== We observe pervasive univariate risk aversion and prudence for monetary gains combined with risk aversion and prudence for gains in longevity. In the loss domain, however, we observe a shift toward more neutrality for risk and prudence for outcomes in euros and outcomes in life years. More importantly, individuals are correlation averse for wealth and longevity for gains, but correlation seeking for wealth and longevity for losses, suggesting that attitudes toward correlation might be sign-dependent. Finally, in the gain domain we observe cross-prudence for wealth, which implies part of precautionary savings by households might be driven by the desire to protect oneself against future longevity risks with higher wealth. More generally, our findings provide evidence on the validity of assumptions underlying models on demand for health insurance, prevention behavior and demand for medical care.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

In the U.S. Medicare and Medicaid programmes, hospitals are paid by Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) since 1983. Medicare and Medicaid cover respectively individuals older than 65 years and poor patients. The DRG system involves paying a fixed tariff for every patient treated. In the United Kingdom, under a policy commonly known as ‘Payment by Results’, hospitals are also paid a tariff for every patient treated, and patients are free to choose the hospital. Hospital competition is also present in other countries such as Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, and Norway. The idea is that hospitals ‘compete’ on quality to attract patients and are rewarded financially for doing so.====Opponents of hospital competition argue that these policies will harm equity. For example, high-quality hospitals will respond to competition by improving even more, while low-quality hospitals will be left behind. A recent report by the European Commission highlights that despite the extensive literature investigating the effect of competition in the health sector, there is very limited literature focusing on its equity implications (EXPH, 2015). Reduction in health inequalities is an ubiquitous policy objective, and it is surprising that it has received little attention in relation to competition. We contribute to fill this gap in knowledge.====In this study we extend the received theoretical literature by investigating (i) whether competition increases or reduces the gap in quality between high- and low-quality hospitals, and (ii) whether, as a result, competition increases or reduces health inequalities. We focus on two dimensions of (pure) health inequalities (Wagstaff and Van Doorslaer, 2000, Section 5). The first type of health inequalities is what is commonly known, in the hospital context, as inequalities due to ‘postcode lottery’: a patient living close to a given hospital might receive much poorer quality compared to a patient living close to a good hospital (Dalton, 2014, p. 4). We refer to this as ====. The second type of health inequalities relates to disparities in health across patients with different severity: if high-severity patients benefit less from competition than low-severity patients, health inequalities will worsen. The equity concern across severity groups is regularly reflected in sub-group analysis (by severity type) in cost-effectiveness analyses (Sculpher and Gafni, 2001). Given that we have two sources of health inequalities, we also investigate how competition affects the Gini coefficient, a commonly used measure to empirically assess health inequalities within or across countries (Wagstaff and Van Doorslaer, 2000).====Our choice of theoretical framework is a Hotelling model with two hospitals located at the endpoints of a unit line and competing on quality. In this respect we follow the existing theoretical literature, where quality competition is typically analysed within a spatial competition framework. We allow one hospital to have a comparative advantage so that hospitals provide different qualities in equilibrium. We also assume that only a fraction of patients make choices about which hospital to attend for treatment (with the remaining patients being treated as the closest hospital). This fraction represents the degree of ====, which we use as our measure of competition. This is a highly policy relevant competition measure in hospital markets, since patient choice can be stimulated by the introduction or the enhancement of public reporting of quality indicators (Siciliani et al., 2017).====Our key findings are as follows. Whether competition increases or reduces ==== across hospitals is generally ambiguous, and depends on three key factors related to the demand for health care and the cost of health care provision, namely (i) decreasing marginal health gains from quality, (ii) differences in price-cost margins between high- and low-quality hospitals, and (iii) quality-dependent unit treatment costs. The first and third of these factors contribute in the direction of quality ==== as a result of more competition, whereas the second factor contributes in the opposite direction.====Whether competition increases or reduces ==== depends on the type of inequality, and the effect does not necessarily go in the same direction as the change in hospital quality differences. If health gains are linear in quality, postcode inequalities go hand in hand with quality differences: they increase (decrease) whenever competition induces quality dispersion (convergence). However, if health gains are strictly concave in quality, then health inequalities can reduce even if competition induces quality dispersion. Thus, competition is more likely to reduce postcode inequality if marginal health gains from quality decrease at a higher rate, which also increases the scope for quality convergence as a result of more competition in the first place.====On the other hand, when considering inequality across severity groups, competition generally ==== health inequalities between high- and low-severity patients, because high-severity patients benefit more from higher quality than do low-severity patients. However, this reduction can be strengthened or weakened by what we refer to as ‘composition effects’, which arise when competition induces high-severity patients to exercise choice to a larger extent than low-severity patients, by selecting hospitals with higher quality.====We then derive the effect of competition on aggregate measures of absolute and relative inequality, namely the Generalised Gini and Gini coefficients, respectively. These measures are conceptually distinct from the above-mentioned measures of dispersion across hospitals and severity groups. Consider for example the special case with just one severity group. Even if competition increases differences in health outcomes across hospitals (i.e., an increase in postcode inequality), the Generalised Gini coefficient may still reduce if competition induces more patients to go to the high-quality hospital. Similarly, even if competition has no effect on differences on health outcomes, the Gini coefficient, which measures relative inequality, will still reduce as a result of the overall increase in quality.====In the full model with two severity groups, we identify two key factors that play a crucial role in determining the effect of competition on aggregate (absolute or relative) inequality, namely (i) the distribution of high- and low-severity patients and (ii) the degree to which health benefits are concave in quality. Since competition tends to reduce inequalities between high- and low-severity patients, it also tends to reduce aggregate inequality if the relative shares of these two patient groups are not too unequal, which means that inequality along this dimension has a large weight in the aggregate inequality measure (Gini or Generalised Gini). Furthermore, if marginal health gains decrease at a sufficiently high rate, competition also tends to reduce postcode inequality, as explained above, which further increases the scope for competition to reduce aggregate inequality.====Finally, although our analysis is predominantly positive, we also include a section where we place our analysis in a normative context by specifying a policy objective function that incorporates concerns for health inequalities. Following the approach by Wagstaff (2002), we define a ‘health achievement’ index that reflects both average health and inequality in the distribution of health, and that is based on an extended Gini coefficient that allows for different degrees of inequality aversion. In this part of the analysis we show that a sufficient (but not necessary) condition for competition to increase overall health achievement is that the market share of the high-quality hospital does not decrease as a result of more competition.====In line with the existing literature, our theoretical model rests on the assumption that hospitals are profit maximisers and suggests that an increase in competition increases quality (Ma and Burgess, 1993, Wolinsky, 1997, Gravelle, 1999, Beitia, 2003; Nuscheler, 2003; Brekke et al., 2006, Brekke et al., 2007, Gaynor, 2006, Karlsson, 2007). This result also holds with altruistic providers but only if the degree of altruism is not too high (Brekke et al., 2011, Brekke et al., 2012; see also Barigozzi and Burani, 2016).====Equity is not addressed in the existing theoretical literature on hospital competition, though, with the exception of Halonen-Akatwijuka and Propper (2013), who investigate hospital managers’ incentive to invest in differential effort for two types of patients. They find that competition could favour the majority group at the expense of the minority one driven by cost substitution across efforts. However, their analysis is different from ours in many respects. First, hospitals are symmetric in costs, therefore ruling out postcode inequalities, which is a key focus for us. Second, patient benefits are linear in effort, so that health inequalities always coincide with quality inequalities. We instead show how increased inequalities in quality are compatible with reduced health inequalities. Third, managers are semi-altruistic and are paid a fixed salary under no competition, while they have a no-profit constraint based on a tariff system under competition; therefore, competition is modelled as a dichotomous variable which introduces a monetary incentive to provide effort. We instead treat the degree of competition as continuous, through a variable which relates to the responsiveness of demand to quality (i.e., the degree of patient choice). Fourth, manager effort varies by patient type, the cost function is quadratic in effort, and efforts can be cost substitutes or complements. We instead assume that quality is common across patient types and adopt a general cost function. Finally, we investigate measures of dispersion such as the Gini index, and the Health Achievement index.====In the empirical literature, the seminal study by Kessler and McClellan (2000) suggests that competition increases quality. This result is also confirmed by Tay (2003), but only partially by Shen (2003), while Gowrinsankaran and Town (2003) find a negative effect. The latest evidence from England suggests that competition, as measured by the introduction of patient choice policies, increases quality under different empirical approaches (Cooper et al., 2011, Gaynor et al., 2013, Bloom et al., 2015). There is only one empirical study which directly tests the effect of competition on equity. Cookson et al. (2013) find that competition did not harm equity, as measured by differences in hip replacement utilisation across socioeconomic status in England. This study is not directly relevant for us given the focus on utilisation as opposed to quality and health outcomes, and the focus on socioeconomic inequalities as opposed to pure health inequalities. Although not focusing on equity, Kessler and Geppert (2005) find that competition improved health for high-severity patients but not for low-severity patients, therefore providing indirect evidence that health inequalities across severity groups reduced.====As previously stressed, our approach is mainly positive rather than normative. Although we could derive the optimal pricing rule set by a welfare maximising regulator, in reality hospital prices are fixed and are set to reflect average treatment costs. We therefore prefer to investigate how competition affects health inequalities under current common financial arrangements. Similarly, although optimal cost regulation (à la Laffont and Tirole, 1993) could be introduced by a regulator to mitigate the implications of cost heterogeneity across hospitals, we are not aware of policy examples where regulators combine price regulations with partial cost reimbursement.====The study is organised as follows. In Section 2, we present the model and derive equilibrium quality.

Yet, little is known about consumer tastes for network breadth and how they affect plan selection. I estimate demand for health plans in California’s Marketplace, Covered California. Using 2017 individual enrollment data and provider network directories, I develop a geospatial measure of network breadth that reflects the physical locations of households and network providers. I find that households are sensitive to network breath in their plan choices. Mean ","Limited provider network health insurance plans, commonly known as “narrow” network plans, have grown in popularity since the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2014. They have become common in the Health Insurance Marketplaces created by the ACA, but also are expanding in employer-based health insurance markets. Approximately 21% of 2017 Marketplace health plans had narrow networks (Polsky et al., 2017); 9% of large employers offered a narrow network plan in 2017 (Claxton et al., 2017). Narrow network plans tend to have lower premiums (Polsky et al., 2016; Sen et al., 2017; Dafny et al., 2017, Dafny et al., 2015), but they may adversely impact enrollees’ access to and choice of providers, timely receipt of care, and financial security (Baicker and Levy, 2015; Corlette et al., 2014).====It is not clear to what extent Marketplace consumers are willing to trade lower premiums for a narrower provider network. Survey evidence suggests both premiums and networks are important components of health plan choice for Marketplace consumers (Hamel et al., 2015). Commonwealth Fund researchers report that, among surveyed Marketplace enrollees that had the option to choose a narrow network with a lower premium, 45% did so and 54% did not (Gunja et al., 2017). Recent studies of Marketplace health plan demand indicate that consumers are premium elastic (Abraham et al., 2017; DeLeire and Marks, 2015; Saltzman, 2019), but they do not estimate network elasticities. And while the literature does examine the relationship between networks and plan choice in other contexts, such as employer-sponsored insurance (Gruber and McKnight, 2016; Ho, 2006) and the pre-ACA Massachusetts health exchange (Shepard, 2016; Ericson and Starc, 2015), these studies may not be generalizable to the post-ACA individual insurance market. Furthermore, with the exception of Gruber and McKnight (2016), these studies all focus on hospital networks. I fill these gaps in the literature by estimating willingness to pay for physician network breadth in an ACA Marketplace.====Because of the decreased access and choice that may result from enrolling in narrow network plans and their prevalence in the individual health insurance market, it is important that policymakers understand the trade-off consumers are willing to make between network breadth and premiums. I analyze demand for health insurance plans in 2017 in California’s State-Based Health Insurance Marketplace, Covered California. Covered California is the largest Health Insurance Marketplace. It covered over 1.5 million Californians in January 2017, which was 13% of Marketplace enrollment nationwide (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2017a, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2017b). In 2017, each of Covered California’s 19 rating areas – geographic units in which insurers offer plans – had at least three competing insurers, each offering at least five plans. This, in conjunction with standardized benefits that drastically limit variation in plan characteristics except for premiums and network breadth, make it an ideal context in which to study Marketplace consumers’ tastes for network breadth. My examination of Covered California complements two studies of demand for network breadth in the pre-ACA Massachusetts individual market (Shepard, 2016; Ericson and Starc, 2015), as well as two other studies of demand for health plans in Covered California (Tebaldi, 2017; Saltzman, 2019).====I use two rich data sets from Covered California on plan enrollment and provider networks to estimate plan choice. I obtain individual-level enrollment data from the 2017 plan year (i.e., the fourth open enrollment period). These data contain information on consumers’ plan choices, geographic location, and demographics. I also obtain audited 2017 network directories from Covered California which list providers by their associated networks.====With these two data sets, I estimate discrete choice models of health plan choice using random parameters mixed logit models. I then calculate own-network breadth and own-premium elasticities and semi-elasticities of demand for different demographic groups. Own-network breadth semi-elasticities increase with age, income, and household size; own-premium semi-elasticities decrease with age, income, and household size. I also calculate willingness to pay for a broad network plan relative to narrow network plan. Using a two standard deviation change in network breadth to define the difference between a broad and a narrow network plan, I find that the mean household is willing to pay roughly $46 in monthly premiums to enroll in a broad network plan (relative to a narrow one). This parameter, however, hides large heterogeneity in willingness to pay, particularly on age. For example, the mean single household with a premium tax credit in the youngest age group (18–29) is willing to pay about $6 for a broad network plan relative to a narrow network one. Their counterpart in the oldest age group is willing to pay roughly $50. This gap in willingness to pay between age groups indicates that a selection mechanism exists whereby older households sort into plans with broader networks, though this is complicated by considerable heterogeneity in willingness to pay ==== age groups.====I also find that Covered California households are highly sensitive to premiums in their plan choices, more so than in other individual insurance markets. This finding is consistent with recent literature that finds that product standardization and standardized presentation of products results in more price sensitive consumers (e.g., Schmitz and Ziebarth, 2017).====This study makes a methodological contribution to the literature by developing a geospatial measure of network breadth to use in demand estimation. Specifically, I define network breadth as the percentage of providers within a fixed-mile radius - 15 miles - of consumers’ homes covered by a network. This measure is more precise than those that defined network breadth as the percentage of in-network providers covered within geopolitical units such as counties or rating areas (e.g., Polsky et al., 2016; Dafny et al., 2017; Sen et al., 2017), which may exhibit drastic variation in size and not capture network breadth as it is experienced by consumers. For example, in Covered California, rating area 1 consists of the northern third of California, while rating area 4 is San Francisco County. In rating area 1, consumers can live hundreds of miles away from in-network providers from whom they are unlikely to seek care. Yet, consumers living in rating area 4 could easily seek care outside of their rating area. As this example makes clear, measures of network breadth based on geopolitical boundaries are unlikely to capture variation in network breadth as it is experienced by consumers.====The literature does contain another geospatial measure of network breadth known as network value (Capps et al., 2003). Network value is the sum of the consumer surplus provided to health plan enrollees by a given plan’s network. It is calculated by first estimating demand for providers, typically hospitals, in a market. Distance to the provider is often a covariate in the demand model (e.g., Ho and Lee, 2013). Then, using the estimates of provider demand, a consumer surplus measure is constructed and added to a separate model of demand for health plans. The creation of the network value measure, aside from requiring the estimation of a separate demand system, often requires that the researcher have access to an all-payer claims database. My geospatial measure of network breadth preserves the geospatial component typically used in network value measures without placing these constraints upon the researcher.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the market structure of the Health Insurance Marketplaces and Covered California. Section 3 reviews data sources and develops my network breadth measure. Section 4 specifies a discrete choice logit model of plan choice for Covered California health plans, develops an empirical model, and discusses identification. Results are presented in Section 5. Section 6 discusses findings and reviews policy implications.

While the financial costs associated with this surgical procedure are well recognized, less is known on the intangible health costs borne by mothers and their families. We contribute to the debate by investigating the effect of unplanned ==== on mothers’ mental health in the first nine months after the delivery. Differently from previous studies, we account for the unobserved heterogeneity due to the fact that mothers who give birth through an unplanned caesarean delivery may be different than mothers who give birth with a natural delivery. Identification is achieved exploiting exogenous variation in the position of the baby in the womb at the time of delivery while controlling for ==== unobserved factors. We find that mothers having an unplanned caesarean section are at higher risk of developing ==== and this result is robust to alternative specifications.","Over the past few decades, a dramatic growth in the caesarean section (CS) rate has been recorded in many developed countries, regardless of the type of healthcare system (and relative incentives for physicians) and women's health needs (Bragg et al., 2010, Gibbons et al., 2010). In England, for example, the overall rate was about nine per cent during the 1980s, while nowadays more than one-fourth of women gives birth through caesarean delivery (Health and Social Care Information Centre, 2012, OECD, 2017). This implies that the incidence of this surgical procedure has almost tripled over the last 30 years. Similar patterns have been experienced by other OECD countries (Declercq et al., 2006, Macfarlane et al., 2015, OECD, 2015), raising questions regarding the economic implications of alternative delivery methods.====Concerns about the increase in caesarean section utilisation are justified by the higher economic and health costs associated with this procedure compared to a normal delivery (Koechlin et al., 2010). Indeed, while it is undeniable that caesarean deliveries have life-saving effects for mothers and children, especially for those who have concurrent health conditions (Gholitabar et al., 2011), it is also recognised that this procedure is very expensive, being the cost of a caesarean delivery between 66 and 88 percent higher than the cost of a natural delivery (Gruber and Owings, 1996, Petrou et al., 2002, Epstein and Nicholson, 2009). Besides the financial impact, the World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted the association of this procedure with short- and long-term health risks for the mother (WHO, 2015).====This paper aims to contribute to the debate by analysing the causal impact of unplanned caesarean sections on first-time mothers’ mental health after childbirth. While the negative effects for mothers’ physical health in terms of longer postpartum recovery and prolonged pain are well-known (Lydon-Rochelle et al., 2001; Jensen and Wüst, 2015), less evidence is available on the effect on their psychological well-being. Mental health issues in general, and postnatal depression in particular, have been found to largely impact the mother's life, as well as being associated with a deterioration of her physical well-being and the relationship with her partner (Mutryn, 1993). Previous studies have also shown a strong link between maternal mental health and child development (Minkovitz et al., 2005, Propper et al., 2007, Kiernan and Mensah, 2009, Coneus and Spiess, 2012), rates of infections, hospital admissions and completion of recommended schedules of immunization for children (WHO, 2015), child health (Perry, 2008), long term child educational, labour market and criminal outcomes (Johnston et al., 2013).====For identification, we focus on unplanned deliveries. This is justified by two reasons. First, elective and unplanned caesarean deliveries may have different impacts on mother's mental health. Indeed, unplanned caesareans are unexpected, usually mentally and physically stressful, and associated with a loss of control and unmatched expectations (Soet et al., 2003, Lobel and DeLuca, 2007). On the contrary, planned caesareans are scheduled in advance, allowing for the possibility for women to adjust (at least partially) their expectations for this event. The second motivation concerns a limitation of the data employed in the analysis. We cannot distinguish among planned caesarean deliveries, those that have been scheduled because of the mothers’ or babies’ health needs and those requested by mothers for other reasons (the so-called ====). Distinguishing between the two cases may be important because a different psychological impact of this procedure is expected depending on the reason why it has been implemented.====Most of the medical studies investigating the relationship between the delivery method and maternal mental health find that caesarean deliveries are expected to carry higher risks for mothers’ mental health compared to natural deliveries. Indeed, women who have a caesarean delivery are more likely to suffer from physical pain after childbirth and have longer and more difficult postnatal recovery (Lydon-Rochelle et al., 2001, Cooklin et al., 2015), both conditions that also affect their psychological well-being. Additionally, caesarean deliveries may have a direct effect on mothers’ mental health due to separation of mothers and their babies in the instants after the delivery (Mutryn, 1993). However, previous literature investigating this topic has not reached a unanimous consensus on whether having a caesarean delivery increases the risk of postnatal depression. This may depend on the limitations that characterise some of these studies, such as the small sample usually restricted to a particular geographic location or a population cohort, which does not allow to generalise the results to the entire population (Fisher et al., 1997, Koo et al., 2003). Failure to distinguish between elective (i.e. planned) and unplanned caesarean deliveries might also represent an issue, given that people tend to adjust better to traumatic events when they can predict or prepare for them (Clement, 2001). Additionally, the variability in the source of information on mothers’ mental health (e.g. medical visits, self-completion questionnaires) and in the length of the postnatal period during which mothers develop depression (from a few weeks to one year after childbirth), can contribute to explain such heterogeneity (Robertson et al., 2004, Patel et al., 2005a, Patel et al., 2005b, Carter et al., 2006).====In general, these studies are characterised by the common assumption that the treatment (i.e. giving birth through an unplanned caesarean delivery) is randomly assigned. In other words, they implicitly assume that women who have an unplanned caesarean do not differ from those who give birth naturally except through observable characteristics for which we can control.==== However, because of data limitations and the multiplicity of factors that can have an impact on both the delivery method and the mothers’ mental health, it is very unlikely to be the case. As a result, the estimates reported in these studies may be (downward) biased.====This paper builds on the previous research by addressing some of these issues. It investigates the effect of caesarean deliveries on the risk of postnatal depression by employing a nationally-representative sample of mothers during their first pregnancy experience, obtained from the first sweep of the UK Millennium Cohort Study. We use a medium-term measure of maternal postnatal depression, which captures a period of sadness in the first nine months after childbirth. More importantly, this study represents the first attempt to identify the ==== link between unplanned caesarean deliveries and mothers’ mental health, by accounting for unobserved differences between mothers who give birth through different delivery methods (endogeneity). While other papers in the economic literature have dealt with this issue when analysing the causal effect of the delivery method on mothers’ (Halla et al., 2016) and children's outcomes (Jensen and Wüst, 2015, Costa-Ramon et al., 2018 Costa-Ramon et al., 2018), none of them have looked at the psychological consequences for mothers, yet the econometric methods they have employed are different from those used in this study.====We identify two main sources of endogeneity. One is due to the unobserved hospital characteristics that can both affect the choice of the delivery method as well as the risk of developing postnatal depression. For example, the level of resources available in a hospital in terms of staff and operating rooms may affect the level and standard of care. More specifically, in a hospital with a low nurse-to-patient ratio, women may receive less attention both during the labor and after the delivery. This may translate into (a) more compilations during labor, and therefore, into a higher risk of having an unplanned caesarean and (b) less psychological support after the delivery. At the same time, because the caesarean section is a surgical procedure, which requires it to be performed in operating rooms by surgeons, medical staff may decide to opt for this delivery method only in extreme cases and they may prefer to perform a natural (or instrumental) delivery whenever possible.====The second potential source of endogeneity is related to the fact that mothers who have an unplanned caesarean section might be systematically different from mothers who give birth naturally, in terms of their own health and of the health of their babies. While we can control for some characteristics (e.g. maternal age and baby's health at birth) which the literature has identified as driving the risk of having an unplanned caesarean delivery, there may be other factors we cannot observe due to data limitations, such as the mother's mental and physical health before and during the pregnancy. Also, we do not have detailed information on what occurred during the delivery and whether pain relief was used. However, epidural anesthesia has been found to increase the risk of unplanned caesarean delivery, and it is also associated with a reduction of pain during labour, which turns into a lower psychological impact from this event. As a result, failing to account for this factor can affect the estimation results.====In order to overcome these problems, we adopt an instrumental variable approach combined with hospital fixed effects, the latter being used to control for time-invariant characteristics at hospital level. As source of exogenous variation we exploit, for the first time in the literature, the position of the baby in the womb at the time of delivery. It has been shown that, conditional on the mother's observable characteristics, the probability of having babies in an abnormal position (i.e. with shoulders or feet first) is random==== and mothers cannot affect it with their behavior (Impey et al., 2017).====Our results show that having an unplanned caesarean delivery increases the risk of postnatal depression. Without accounting for endogeneity, we find that a woman who gives birth through this procedure is 2.5 percentage points more likely to experience postnatal depression. The sign of this effect is confirmed by the IV estimates, even if in this case marginal effects are larger (15.1 percentage points). Results are robust to a number of specifications.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 summarises previous literature on this topic. Data are described in Section 3, while Section 4 presents our empirical strategies. Section 5 shows the main results and discusses the validity of the instruments employed in the analysis.

Common regulations for promoting equitable access to insurance include limitations on insurer price discrimination and requirements to offer insurance to all consumers, including those with preexisting conditions. These regulations can exacerbate adverse selection, reducing the economic efficiency of health insurance provision (Handel et al., 2015). Strategies adopted under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) for mitigating the effects of adverse selection include both policy “carrots,” such as subsidies for purchasing health insurance, and policy “sticks,” such as penalties for not having insurance. Understanding how consumers respond to these financial incentives is critical in assessing the efficacy of these alternative strategies.====In this paper, I analyze demand for health insurance by studying consumer behavior in the ACA exchanges. The ACA exchanges provide an appealing context for analyzing health insurance demand. First, the setting provides an opportunity to assess how consumers respond to both policy carrots and sticks that incentivize enrollment. Second, analysis of the ACA setting helps to address some of the data shortcomings of examining the pre-ACA individual market, such as measurement error of premiums, choice sets, and other key variables (Auerbach and Ohri, 2006).====I estimate demand for health insurance using consumer-level data from the California and Washington ACA exchanges. My data contain about ==== million records in California and ==== records in Washington across the 2014 and 2015 plan years, accounting for approximately ====% of nationwide enrollment in the ACA exchanges (Department of Health and Human Services, 2015). Detailed demographic information on income, age, smoking status, and geographic residence enables me to precisely calculate (1) the premium that consumers face for each plan in their choice sets; (2) the consumer-specific subsidy received for each plan; and (3) the consumer-specific penalty imposed for forgoing coverage. I combine the consumer-level demand data from the exchanges with data on the uninsured from the American Community Survey (ACS) to form the universe of potential exchange consumers.====Using these data, I estimate nested logit discrete choice models of demand for health insurance at the consumer level for both California and Washington. To address potential endogeneity of the premium, I exploit consumer-level variation in premiums created by exogenous ACA regulations, including subsidy eligibility thresholds, exemptions from the individual mandate, and the phase-in of the mandate between 2014 and 2016. I also estimate the model with the control function approach of Petrin and Train (2010).====My empirical findings suggest that exchange consumers are highly premium sensitive. I estimate that the mean own-premium elasticity of demand ranges from ==== to ==== in California and from ==== to ==== in Washington. The mean premium elasticity for exchange coverage is ==== in California and ==== in Washington. I also find that young adults are considerably more premium sensitive; in California, the mean own-premium elasticity of demand ranges from ==== to ==== for adults between the ages of ==== and ==== and from ==== to ==== for adults over the age of ====. Low-income individuals, smokers, racial minorities, and males also have more premium-elastic demand.====My demand estimates also indicate that the mandate penalty ==== has a relatively small impact on consumer choice, but the penalty's ==== motivates some consumers to purchase insurance. I find evidence of a “taste for compliance” with the individual mandate that has been theorized in the ACA literature (Saltzman et al., 2015, Frean et al., 2017). A taste for compliance is a consumer preference for being socially responsible and complying with the law, regardless of the penalty amount. The taste for compliance could also be described as an aversion to paying a fine or experiencing a loss (Kahneman and Tversky, 1984).====I then use the demand estimates to simulate the impact of policies targeting adverse selection, including the individual mandate and premium subsidies. The mandate represents an economic tradeoff between addressing underenrollment of low-risk consumers that may result from adverse selection and compelling consumers to purchase insurance against their will. Another potential impact of the mandate is a higher rate of underinsurance, which I investigate in concurrent work (Saltzman, 2018). I find that repealing the individual mandate modestly increases consumer surplus because the ACA's price-linked subsidies protect most consumers from premium increases that may result from repeal and some consumers are not compelled to purchase insurance against their will. In contrast, repealing the mandate when fixed subsidies or vouchers replace the ACA's price-linked subsidies would result in a sharp decline in consumer surplus because vouchers expose consumers to premium increases. Hence, the policy rationale for the individual mandate depends on the extent of adverse selection and the presence of other policies such as price-linked subsidies that are designed to mitigate the effects of adverse selection.====I make several contributions to the literature. First, my empirical work uses consumer-level data with exogenous variation in premiums to estimate consumer premium elasticities in two state ACA exchanges. Second, I formalize the notion of a taste for compliance with the mandate in terms of compensating variation and find empirical evidence to support the hypothesized taste for compliance. This result has important implications for the efficacy of policy sticks relative to policy carrots in incentivizing the purchase of health insurance. Third, my counterfactual analysis reveals an important interaction between policies targeting adverse selection that warrants discussion in the health reform debate.====This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 surveys the relevant literature. Section 3 provides a brief overview of the ACA. Section 4 develops a model of health insurance demand. Section 5 describes the data I use in my analysis.

To affect these outcomes, family midwives consult mothers at their homes for up to two years after birth to enhance maternal skills (e.g., attachment behavior, interactions, and teaching skills) and increase the women's personal strengths (e.g., self-efficacy, problem-solving abilities and self-esteem). Such home visiting programs are popular public health policies in many developed countries. For example, in the United States the federal government initiated the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program (MIECHV Program) to support state implementation of early childhood home visiting programs. Between 2012–2015, the annual funding for the MIECHV program which served more than 300,000 disadvantaged families and children was $500 million (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2015). In the UK home visiting programs deliver services to 16,000 disadvantaged new families each year (UK Department of Health, 2013).====Although home visiting programs aim at improving aspects of the maternal life course, it is arguable whether they actually achieve this aim. On one hand, the intervention could be successful, leading to higher maternal workforce participation through improving mothers’ awareness of their personal strengths. Due to their higher occupational aspirations, these mothers may decide to delay further births. On the other hand, the intervention could increase women's satisfaction with their maternal role by improving their maternal skills. Greater maternal satisfaction and well-being could increase either fertility or the length of time mothers want to stay at home with their child. Both possibilities could lead to longer absences from the workforce. Therefore, which of the two effects predominates remains an open empirical question.====This paper presents the first economic analysis investigating the effects of one such home visiting program on maternal outcomes by exploiting a randomized controlled trial (RCT). The program, named ====, delivers home visits starting during pregnancy until two years after birth for disadvantaged first-time mothers. ==== is the German adaptation of the Nurse Family Partnership (NFP) program, widely considered the most important subprogram of the MIECHV Program.====The results suggest that the intervention ==== fertility and ==== employment. The effects are sizable, implying that among the intervention group, the probability of a second birth increased by 35 percent (from 18.3 to 24.7 percent) and employment decreased by 18 percent (from 50.7 to 41.4 percent). The effect on fertility is explained mainly by a reduction in abortions in this group of women. Since I observe several secondary outcomes which are not direct targets of ====, such as partner stability, child care use, contraceptive use and maternal life satisfaction, I can investigate potential channels for effects on the primary ==== outcomes. I exclude more favorable family environments, such as more stable partnerships in the treatment group, as a potential mechanism for the fertility effect. However, in line with the goals of the intervention, it decreased maternal perceived stress and increased life satisfaction, indicating that mothers in the treatment group are more satisfied with their maternal role. This higher satisfaction is strongly correlated with the mothers’ decision to have more births in the treatment group and it may have caused the mothers to choose to stay longer at home with their child.====My analysis provides the rare opportunity to draw on both administrative data from the German social security system including information on employment, wages, welfare benefits, and household composition, and survey data from biannual telephone and face-to-face interviews. The administrative data are available for over 90% of the sample for the first three years after the birth of the first child. These data are objectively measured and thus should not be biased by the treatment and control groups’ differentially reporting outcomes. The survey data allows me to examine a much richer set of outcomes (e.g., conception, abortions, childcare use, and subjective statements about perceived stress and life satisfaction), allowing me to identify channels for the findings derived from the administrative data.====The results from ==== question the findings from U.S. medical studies using RCTs that home visiting, in particular NFP, decreased fertility and welfare dependency and increased maternal employment (Olds et al., 2007, Olds et al., 1997, Brooks-Gunn et al., 1994). These results received extensive attention among policy makers, and the fiscal savings due to lower welfare payments representing one reason that governments expand home visiting programs (e.g., Miller, 2015). Because the content, implementation, and participants were very similar in the ==== and U.S. studies, a compelling explanation for the different results may be the specific arrangements of the welfare state. For example, the German welfare programs include means-tested welfare payments that do not include work obligations or benefit cuts until the child's third birthday.====Additionally, financial incentive programs effective at encouraging work among low-income families with children, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in the U.S. (e.g., Hoynes and Patel, 2015), do not exist in Germany. As the German welfare state environment provides few incentives for maternal workforce participation, the intervention's impact on maternal skills and life satisfaction might predominate over its impact on personal strengths, leading to longer maternity leave periods and subsequent births instead of higher employment. In contrast, in a stricter welfare environment, the effect on personal skills may predominate because mothers gain a larger utility increase from early employment. Given that welfare arrangements for mothers strongly vary among U.S. states, home visiting may have similar effects on the life course as the ==== intervention in states with more generous welfare.====The findings of this paper are highly relevant because they contribute to the growing literature investigating how early childhood interventions generate effects on children. This literature has rarely considered maternal life course as relevant channel so far.==== In the analyzed intervention, shorter spacing between births may have negative effects on children's test scores and health outcomes (Buckles and Munnich, 2012, Conde-Agudelo et al., 2006). Additionally, a literature in economics has shown that children from larger families tend to have lower educational attainment, lower IQ scores, poorer employment outcomes, and a greater likelihood of engaging in risky behavior (Kessler, 1991, Hanushek, 1992, Black et al., 2010). However, mothers decided to work less after birth and reported higher well-being, which both can positively affect child development and child health (Bernal and Keane, 2011, Carneiro et al., 2015, Berger and Spiess, 2011). The findings of Sandner and Jungmann (2017) and Sandner et al. (2018) that the ==== program has smaller positive effects on infant health and development compared with studies in the U.S. suggest that, at least in the short term, the development and health reducing effect predominates in Germany.====The findings of this paper also provide new insights into the fertility decision of disadvantaged women. Several studies have investigated whether family planning services or economic circumstances (e.g., media influence, regional income inequality, and welfare policies) affect the fertility behavior of disadvantaged women (e.g., Paton and Wright, 2017, Packham, 2017, Kearney and Levine, 2015b, Kearney and Levine, 2014, Grogger and Bronars, 2001). These studies present mixed findings with mostly small effect sizes. However, most studies in this fertility literature concentrated only on birth as the fertility outcome rather than identifying what role contraceptive use or abortions played in changing the birth rates. In contrast, in addition to births, the ==== study also observes, contraceptive use, conception, abortions, and miscarriages. Furthermore, so far research has paid little attention whether maternal well-being and satisfaction with the maternal role are related to fertility decisions of disadvantaged women. My results therefore much more broadly show through which channels policies and economic circumstances affect the fertility of young low-income women. As the ==== results suggest, the abortion margin and perceived well-being play important roles when disadvantaged women make decisions about fertility.====Finally, the findings on maternal welfare dependency and employment decisions are of high short-term fiscal relevance because disadvantaged mothers receive a substantial share of total welfare payments in many developed countries.==== In addition, Dahl et al. (2014) show that increases in the welfare participation of one generation can affect the participation behavior of the next generation as well. Given this finding, the effects of home visiting on maternal welfare might also increase their children's receipt of welfare and have long-term fiscal consequences. However, a cost-benefit perspective that considers the positive effects on life satisfaction and fertility (assuming that home visiting increases completed fertility) may conclude that – despite higher welfare expenditures – the life course effects add more benefits than costs.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the literature on the effects of home visiting on maternal life course. Section 3 and 4 provide descriptions of the ==== program, the experimental design, the baseline sample, and the data used in this study. Section 5 proves the validity of the experimental design, and Section 6 presents the estimation strategy. Section 7 shows the results, and Section 8 compares them with the results of U.S. studies.

I estimate the health impacts of the ==== Zone (EZ) program—a federal program that gave sizeable grants and ,"Poor neonatal health imposes large costs on individuals and society. Despite low birth weight rates of only 8 percent nationally, low birth weight babies incur nearly half of all neonatal hospital costs (Almond et al., 2010; Russell et al., 2007). Additionally, rates of low birth weight differ greatly by race, with non-Hispanic blacks nearly twice as likely as non-Hispanic whites to have a low birth weight baby (Reichman, 2005). The costs of low birth weight are not limited to hospital costs: low birth weight is predictive of worse later-life education, labor market, and health outcomes as well (see e.g., Almond and Currie, 2011). Therefore, policies that improve birth outcomes, especially among high risk mothers, are important.====In this paper, I explore whether the empowerment zone (EZ) program—a federal stimulus package aimed at improving infrastructure and labor market conditions in low-income, high-poverty urban areas—had unintended effects on fertility and health. The EZ program is a place-based policy, meaning that the program benefits have to be spent within the program’s geographic limits or claimed by individuals living within the zone. While most previous place-based research has focused on employment and wage effects of the policies, the effect of place-based programs on health is an integral, understudied area. This study provides the first analysis of the EZ program on fertility and health, an important extension of the overall effects of both the place-based policy literature more broadly and the EZ literature specifically. The EZ program offered generous tax credits to businesses both operating in these areas and hiring EZ residents, and granted $100 million for infrastructure projects. The EZ program increased employment and earnings among zone residents (Busso et al., 2013; Ham et al., 2011). In addition to potential income effects on health, place-based programs may also have network effects in which residents help nearby residents find jobs (Bayer et al., 2008; Neumark and Simpson, 2015), and influence health insurance decisions and health behaviors (Grossman and Khalil, 2017). The potential for knowledge spillovers is another mechanism through which a place-based policy may effect health (Glaeser and Gottlieb, 2008).====I use vital statistics natality data from 1990 to 2002, which I link for 9 cities and states to create a unique data set.==== The data set consists of restricted-access, administrative records with geocoded census tract of residence for mothers. Using a difference-in-differences model, I compare areas that received Round I EZs to areas that applied for but did not receive EZs or received EZs at a later point in time. These control areas all qualified for EZ status under the program guidelines and are a natural comparison for the EZs. Indeed, these are the areas used as control zones in much of the previous EZ literature (Busso et al., 2013; Hanson, 2009; Hanson and Rohlin, 2011a,b, 2013,Reynolds and Rohlin, 2015).====I find a large and statistically significant effect of EZs on fertility rates, birth weight, and low birth weight. Fertility rates decrease by 10 births per 1000 females of age 15–44 in EZs compared to control areas, an 11 percent decrease. Fertility effects by age provide evidence that the decreases in fertility do not reflect women delaying pregnancy to a later point in time, but an overall decrease in fertility. Birth weight increases by 26 gs on average in EZs, a 0.8 percent increase, while low birth weight rates decrease by 0.8 percentage points in EZs compared to control zones, an 8 percent decline. While some compositional change in mothers occurred, it was not large enough to explain the improvements in infant health.====To test for pre-trends in the data and to allow for dynamic treatment effects, I also perform event study analyses. These results demonstrate that treatment effects grow over time while showing little evidence of pre-trends. Addressing concerns about whether control areas from different cities differ on unobservable characteristics, I perform all analyses using an alternate control group composed of areas in the same city as the EZs. Results are consistent across these alternative methods and specifications.====This paper contributes to the growing literature on the effects of the social safety net on birth outcomes. Previous work has demonstrated that income-targeted programs, including the earned income tax credit (Hoynes et al., 2015) and food stamps (Almond et al., 2011), reduce low birth weight rates, while having little effect on fertility rates (Baughman and Dickert-Conlin, 2009). Where my work differs and provides an additional contribution is that it studies a policy targeting a particular area.====These results suggest that policy makers and researchers should consider the health effects of any program that affects income and infrastructure when developing and evaluating these programs. Ignoring the health effects of these programs underestimates the overall program effect, especially given the importance of birth outcomes on later life labor and health outcomes.====I describe the institutional details of the EZ program in Section 2. Section 3 provides a literature review and discusses potential channels through which the EZ program may affect fertility and health. Section 4 discusses the data. Section 5 describes the methods and identification strategy. In Section 6, I present the main findings, heterogeneous treatment effects, and robustness checks.

Using data from up to 22 years after the lottery, we find that in most years after ==== dentists earn around 50,000 Euros more than they would earn in their next-best ","Governments in many countries limit the number of people working in the medical sector. This is often achieved by restricting access to medical training places. Arguments to restrict supply are that training people for medical professions is costly and that additional supply may create its own demand.==== To avoid that reduced supply translates into excessive rents for medical professionals, many governments regulate the prices that can be charged for medical services. It is, however, hard to assess whether the resulting earnings for medical professionals are “correct”. One way to assess the correctness of earnings of medical professionals is to compare their earnings with what the same workers would have earned in alternative professions. This is for example the question that researchers try to answer when calculating the public-private wage gap (e.g. Bradley et al., 2017, Hartog and Oosterbeek, 1993).====In this study we focus on dentists in the Netherlands and try to answer the question how much more dentists earn compared to what the same people could have earned in another profession. To do so, we take advantage of the fact that in the years 1991–1999, there were always more applicants for dental schools in the Netherlands than available places and that a lottery determined which applicants were admitted. In this design, losers of the admission lotteries serve as comparison group. This creates an arguably more convincing comparison group than is usually the case when earnings are compared across different occupations or sectors. In those cases identification is typically based on a conditional independence assumption.====Combining data on results of the admission lotteries with data on later earnings allows us to estimate the causal effect of studying dentistry on earnings. In addition to earnings outcomes, we also examine whether studying dentistry instead of the next-best field, affects working hours, human capital investments and private-life outcomes.====We are not the first to relate the earnings of dentists to limited supply and contribute to a broader literature on occupational licensing (for example Kleiner, 2000) and one on dentistry in particular. In an early study, Shepard (1978) compares prices for dental services and mean dentists’ income between thirty-five states in the US that restricted licensing of out-of-state dentists and fifteen states having reciprocity agreements recognizing each other's licenses. He finds that prices and incomes are 12–15% higher in the non-reciprocity states (p.200). Using a more refined measure of states’ strictness in licensing, Kleiner and Kudrle (2000) confirm Shepard's results with respect to prices of dental services and mean dentists’ income. In addition, they find no evidence that stricter licensing influences the quality of dental services.====Our paper also contributes to the recently emerging literature that examines payoffs to specific fields of study (e.g. Hastings et al., 2013; Grosz, 2016; Ketel et al., 2016 and Kirkebøen et al., 2016; see also: Altonji et al., 2012, Altonji et al., 2016). Most related is our previous paper (Ketel et al., 2016) where we use admission lotteries to estimate the financial payoffs to completing medical school in the Netherlands. There we find that in every year after graduation doctors earn at least 20% more than similar applicants who end up in their next-best profession.====Almost immediately after graduation the annual gross income of people who studied dentistry is on average 50,000 Euros higher than what they would have earned in their next-best field of study. This amounts to a premium of 63%. We have information up to 22 years after students’ first application to study dentistry and find that the annual gain is fairly stable over this period and is driven by income generated from self employment. We do not find that dentists work longer hours, incur larger investments during their studies in terms of forgone earnings and direct expenses, or make larger sacrifices in private-life outcomes. Given that there are about twice as many applicants than available places also speaks against the explanation that the high payoffs compensate for other unattractive features of the work as such a compensation should only make the marginal dentist indifferent.====One plausible explanation for the high payoffs for dentists is that they earn a monopoly rent due to the limited supply. To investigate this further we regressed earnings of dentists on the relative supply of dentists in local labor markets controlling for region and year fixed effects. Consistent with the monopoly rent explanation we find that dentist's earnings decrease with dentist density. Also the fact that the supply of dentists in the Netherlands is lower than in most other countries, and that payoffs are equally high for low-GPA dentists as for high-GPA dentists are consistent with rents explaining the high returns. Other potential explanations for the high payoffs are supplier-induced demand due to asymmetric information between dentists and patients, and comparative advantage where dentists possess a unique bundle of skills that makes them very productive as dentists but not very productive elsewhere. Our research design does not allow us to disentangle between the supplier-induced demand, the comparative advantage and the monopoly-rent explanations.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The next section provides further details about the institutional context and the admission lottery to the study of dentistry. Section 3 describes the data used in this paper. Section 4 discusses the empirical model and the identification. Section 5 presents the main results, while Section 6 assesses the heterogeneity of treatment effects between men and women and by high school GPA. In that section, we also compare the payoffs of completing dentistry to the payoffs of completing medical school. Section 7 discusses possible reasons for the large earnings premium. We consider working hours, costs of studying, compensating differentials, comparative advantage and monopoly rents.

To this end, we exploit closures and openings of entire cancer clinics in Swedish hospitals which provides sharp and arguably exogenous variation in case volumes. Using detailed register data on more than 100,000 ==== episodes of advanced cancer surgery, our results suggest substantial positive effects of operation volume on survival. Complementary analyses point to learning-by-doing as an important explanation.","In most Western countries, high-volume hospitals perform better than low-volume hospitals (Halm et al., 2002, Kizer, 2003, Chowdhury et al., 2007). A question of major importance is whether such patterns reflect a causal effect of operation volume on patient outcomes. Several professional organizations in the health care sector argue so and have advocated the establishment of minimum volume standards for certain medical procedures. In the US, the Leapfrog Group, a coalition of 140 Fortune 500 employers and public-sector purchasers of health care have established such standards for a number of complex surgical procedures.==== A similar initiative has been taken by the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) who created a Centers of Excellence accreditation program, where accreditation partly depends on fulfilling certain volume standards. Similar guidelines are under development, or already in place, in many other Western countries as well.====Advocates of minimum volume standards refer to learning-by-doing and economics of scale as possible mechanisms behind the volume–outcome relationship (Luft et al., 1987). The debate about the direction and existence of causality between hospital volume and health outcomes is far from settled, however. Differences in outcomes between high and low-volume hospitals may also reflect ==== where high-quality hospitals attract more patients. Moreover, individuals may self-select into areas with certain types of hospitals. These competing explanations have very different policy implications and to date, there is limited evidence on whether the volume–outcome relationship reflects a causal effect of operation volume.====In this paper, we contribute to the debate by estimating the effect of operation volume in cancer surgery on patient outcomes in Sweden. In order to address the selection problem, we introduce an empirical design that exploits rapid shifts in operation volume following from closures and openings of entire cancer clinics at hospitals.==== We take advantage of an institutional feature of the Swedish public health care system, where a closure of a cancer clinic means that the remaining cancer clinics in the same region have to take on the patients from the closed clinic's catchment area, leading to sharp discontinuities in operation volume within health-care regions. We use data from the health registers to identify all closures and openings of cancer clinics in Sweden between 1998 and 2007 and use the closures and openings as instruments for operation volume at the remaining clinics.====We use data on all breast cancer, prostate cancer and colorectal cancer surgical procedures performed at Swedish clinics between 1998 and 2007 — in total more than 100,000 episodes. The data includes rich and detailed information about the type of surgery, complementary treatments, date of clinic admission and discharge, prevalence of post-surgery complications and comorbidities for each patient. Cancer surgery constitutes an interesting case study since a strong association between operation volume and patient outcomes has been reported in the medical literature and since cancer presents a major health care challenge in all OECD countries.====To rule out that our results are driven by changes in the patient mix following from the closures and openings of clinics, we exploit an institutional feature of the Swedish health care system in which individuals are assigned to a clinic based on their geographical location. We are thus able to keep the underlying patient population constant by ==== studying the outcomes of those patients that belonged to a clinic's catchment area ==== the inflow of additional cancer patients from the closed clinics, ensuring that the population studied remains the same in terms of both observed and unobserved factors. The comparison group thus ==== consists of patients at clinics in regions where no closures or openings took place in the same year.====We deal with several other threats to our empirical design. First, the exclusion restriction would fail if the closure or opening of cancer clinics cause more general organizational changes in remaining clinics. We would then see effects on other types of surgery in the same hospital, but we find no evidence of this. Second, we pay special attention to comorbid conditions and control for specific conditions, such as hypertension, tumor metastases, diabetes and congestive health diseases as well as the Elixhauser comorbidity measure (Quan et al., 2005).====Our results suggest large returns to operation volume. Our instrumental variables estimate imply a mean mortality rate elasticity with respect to operation volume of about −0.12. We can relate the size of this effect to the variation in volume across cancer clinics in Sweden, implying that increasing the volume of a clinic from the 25th percentile to the 50th percentile of the volume distribution (i.e., from 70 to 130 annual operations) would decrease 4 year post-surgery mortality with about 2.7 percentage points, or by 11.1% at the mean.====We also use our estimates to perform policy simulations. We consider how different minimum case volume thresholds would affect the mortality rate and the number of cancer clinics. We find that a minimum volume threshold of 160 cases per year would decrease the number of clinics in Sweden by 50% and 4-year mortality by about two percentage points. These quite substantial effects suggest that there are large potential gains from concentrating the number of cancer clinics to fewer units (keeping overall case volume constant). This result lends some support to recent initiatives to establish minimum operation volume thresholds for advanced surgical procedures.====Our results also provide some evidence on possible mechanisms behind the observed volume effects. Initially, we use detailed data on medical technology, such as complementary treatments and robot surgery, to examine if the increased case volume cause changes in medical technology. We find no evidence of any such changes. The closures may also affect the composition of cancer surgeons and thereby also patient outcomes. However, by exploiting linked employer–employee data from administrative registers we conclude that changes in surgeon characteristics is an unlikely explanation for our estimated effects.====Instead, we find evidence in line with a learning-by-doing interpretation. We show that while case volume increases, the number of surgeons remains unchanged, implying that each surgeon takes on more patients. We also find that the volume effects increase with the complexity of the procedure. Moreover, we find that higher operation volume reduces the probability of the patient having a subsequent cancer surgery and reduces the probability of complications during surgery. If learning-by-doing is an important mechanism, we also expect that cumulated operation volume should matter and not only current volume. Estimating the effect of both current and cumulative operation volume over several years, we find that both current and past experience seem to matter.====We also examine whether the learning effects are more likely to reflect individual or organizational learning-by-doing. Here we follow the approach by Levitt et al. (2013), who argue that, if organizational learning-by-doing is important, learning should be the same in organizations with high and low employee turnover. If the entire organization learns, then the fact that employees are constantly replaced in high turnover organizations should not affect the relationship between volume and quality, whereas if experience is mainly embodied in individual employees, we should observe stronger volume effect for clinics with a low turnover. We find strong effects for clinics with low turnover but not for clinics with a high turnover, hence suggesting that learning is mainly embodied in individual surgeons.====Our paper relates and contributes to the volume–outcome literatures in economics and medicine. The medical literature typically attempts to address endogeneity of patient volume by controlling for observable patient characteristics, such as age, gender, and reported health conditions.==== In order to account for unobserved heterogeneity across hospitals, a few papers have utilized longitudinal data in order to estimate hospital fixed-effects models (Hamilton and Hamilton, 1997, Hamilton and Ho, 1998).====In the economics literature, a few US-based studies have used an instrumental variables design to address the endogeneity of hospital volume. Gaynor et al. (2005) find that higher volume decreases in-hospital mortality following heart surgery, using the number of hospitals offering CABG operating in a specific radius around the hospital of treatment and the number of patients living in this radius as instruments for volume. They also study to what extent the volume–outcome relationship can be explained by learning-by-doing.==== Gowrisankaran et al. (2006) use hospital distance interacted with hospital and patient characteristics as an instrument and find negative volume effects on in-hospital mortality after heart surgery.==== These studies provide new and valuable insights on the volume–outcome relationship, but, as this brief literature review shows, the current literature on the causal effect of volume is still in its infancy and more knowledge is clearly needed.====The remainder of the article proceeds as follows: Section 2 provides a discussion on the closures and openings of cancer clinics that we use in our empirical design.

Through exploiting variation in the number of years individuals have lived in their neighborhood, using a data set from California, I examine if there exist causal effects of exposure to neighborhoods with high potential effects on one's BMI. The identifying assumption is that there are no unobserved individual level characteristics correlated with both BMI and moving, after controlling for observables. I find evidence that suggests that neighborhoods do not have a causal impact on BMI.","There exists great regional variation in obesity rates and BMI across the United States. This geographic variation can be due to the causal effects of neighborhoods, or due to the sorting of individuals choosing to live close to those who are similar to themselves. Disentangling these effects can be important for policy — if neighborhood causal effects exist, then certain programs and interventions may be able to reduce obesity rates and improve public health. In fact, the US government has implemented measures to increase access to grocery stores as well as outdoor parks and recreation.==== However, conclusions from studies examining the causal effects of neighborhoods are mixed.====A large literature, in economics as well as in fields such as epidemiology, sociology and medicine, have investigated the impact of both the physical environment and social environment on BMI. While some papers find that supermarket access, green spaces, physician density and walkability of a neighborhood can encourage a healthy weight, and proximity to restaurants and overweight peers can contribute to weight gain (Macintyre et al., 2002, Xu and Wang, 2015, McCormack et al., 2010, Dur et al., 2011, Davis and Carpenter, 2009, Diez Roux and Mair, 2010, Christakis and Fowler, 2007, Carrell et al., 2011, Currie et al., 2010, Anderson and Matsa, 2011, Slack et al., 2014), others find that neighborhood environments do not have an impact on BMI or healthy food choices (Elbel et al., 2015, Allcott et al., 2017, Handbury et al., 2015, Block et al., 2011).====There are identification challenges to studying the causal effect of neighborhoods on health and BMI. Several papers that find the existence of neighborhood effects do not take into account the selection, or sorting, of healthier individuals into healthier neighborhoods. In addition to the causal effects of neighborhoods, there are other reasons why there are differences in health behavior across regions. It is unclear whether neighborhoods, both the social and physical environment, cause individuals to have higher BMI, or if similar people choose to live among each other.====In this paper, I make progress in identifying if there exist causal effects of neighborhoods on BMI. I do not distinguish between the role of particular aspects of the social or physical environment on BMI. Instead, I group these potential channels into an all-encompassing “neighborhood effect.” To explore neighborhood effects, I exploit variation in neighborhood exposure, defined as the number of years an individual has lived in his neighborhood. I implement this strategy using the California Health Interview Survey, a dataset from the state of California which documents the number of years individuals have lived in their current neighborhoods. I use median neighborhood BMI, defined as the median BMI of non-movers, as a proxy for the influence of both the social and physical environment.====The identification strategy consists of two steps. First, I select zip codes (interchangeable with ==== in this paper) with the largest potential treatment effects, which are those that have a large potential location effect on BMI. This is calculated by examining residuals aggregated at the zip code-level of a regression of individual BMI on individual covariates. An area with a large potential location effect on BMI would have a large residualized BMI, meaning the BMI of non-movers is higher than can be explained by observed individual characteristics alone. This indicates that these areas have certain attributes which make them heavier above and beyond what can be predicted by individual covariates such as income, age and education. These attributes can include unobserved neighborhood characteristics, as well as unobserved individual characteristics.====I note that areas with high residualized BMI have high ==== neighborhood effects — the procedure of identifying these neighborhoods alone does not allow me to distinguish whether the geographic variation in BMI is due to sorting or neighborhood exposure effects. Similarly, I do not assume that areas with residuals of a small magnitude have a small neighborhood effect. In these areas, I cannot distinguish between neighborhood effects and sorting. To disentangle selection or sorting effects from neighborhood causal effects, I focus on high residualized BMI neighborhoods, where the potential for neighborhood effects is greatest. The second step of the two-step empirical strategy involves examining how the effect of location changes over time as a “mover” lives in his neighborhood for longer. As with non-movers, I assume that the BMI of movers can be explained by both individual covariates, as well as a residual term that includes potential location effects. These neighborhood effects can be plausibly interpreted as causal, under assumptions that I describe below. In my study, the difference between initial movers and non-movers in high treatment effect zip codes is around 1.5 points in BMI, or roughly 10 pounds.====I find evidence suggesting that locations barely affect BMI for movers over time, even in these neighborhoods where the potential location effect is high. The BMI of movers does not converge to the BMI of non-movers in areas of high residualized BMI. In order to interpret this result as causal, the identifying assumption I make is that conditional on observed characteristics, there are no unobserved characteristics correlated with both moving and BMI. This is a strong assumption, but if the assumption were violated, estimates of the location effect would be biased away from zero. Since my estimate of the location effect is small and insignificant, concerns of endogeneity affecting the interpretation of the results are alleviated in my setting. My results are consistent with locations not having a causal impact on BMI in high residualized BMI areas.====One potential explanation for these results is that the geographic variation in BMI is primarily driven by sorting. Additionally, my results do not rule out habit formation in early life. It is possible that neighborhoods may have a causal impact on individuals, but only during one's youth.==== Neighborhood effects are potentially no longer salient for adults. In the population that I study, I do not find convergence of the BMI of movers to the BMI of the non-movers, indicating that for adults, the role of habit formation may be limited. Adults may not respond by converging to their surroundings because their habits have been potentially ingrained during childhood.====Several papers have used natural experiments and identification strategies to study the causal effects of neighborhoods on BMI and related health behaviors. These papers find mixed results. On the one hand, Currie et al. (2010) find that living near fast food restaurants may lead to weight gain and increase obesity rates for schoolchildren and pregnant women, by using a large dataset and precise geographical information, as well as exploiting timing of exposure. Courtemanche and Carden (2011) find that living near Walmart Supercenters increases BMI, by using an instrumental variables approach that exploits the geographical pattern of expansion around Walmart's headquarters. Antecol and Bedard (2006) find that the BMI of immigrants converges to the BMI of natives in the United States. On the other hand, Anderson and Matsa (2011) find that living near restaurants has no impact on obesity, by using the presence of interstate highways as an instrument for the supply of restaurants. Handbury et al. (2015) find that disparities in food choices among socioeconomic groups persist even when controlling for food access, indicating that policies to improve healthy food access would be ineffective for the very groups these policies would target. Allcott et al. (2017) find that neighborhood environments do not have meaningful effects on healthy eating by exploiting supermarket entry and moving to healthier neighborhoods.====Random assignment has also been used to study peer effects on BMI and physical fitness. Lim and Meer (2018) use random assignment to study the effect of peer influence on one's own BMI, finding the existence of network effects. Carrell et al. (2011) study peer effects of physical fitness, using randomly assigned friends in the military. They find that peer effects are statistically significant, with the effects concentrated among those with poor fitness.====My paper closely complements work studying health outcomes in the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) program. MTO was a random assignment program in which low income individuals were given vouchers to move into higher income neighborhoods. Kling et al. (2007) examine health consequences five years after the implementation of MTO, finding that moving to a lower poverty neighborhood has a substantial effect on reducing obesity, which is partially inconsistent with my findings. However, they caution that this statistically significant result was one of many analyzed from a family of outcomes from the MTO study, and thus may be a false positive. They also find that the program had no effect on physical well-being, but had substantial effects on mental health for adults and female youth. Ludwig et al. (2013) also examine the effects of MTO on health, but over a longer time horizon of 10–15 years. They find that cases of extreme obesity (BMI greater than 40) were reduced. Over the longer time horizon, MTO also improved physical and mental health. I contribute to this literature by examining a broader population, rather than focusing on low income movers who volunteered to take part in the experiment. I also use a treatment which is more specific to the outcome of interest, BMI, rather than a treatment of moving to a lower poverty neighborhood.====Previous work has also discussed the associative relationships between neighborhood characteristics, and BMI and associated health behaviors. Walkability of a neighborhood (Xu and Wang, 2015) and proximity to parks, recreational areas and green spaces have been found to encourage physical activity (McCormack et al., 2010). Children with better access to parks have been found to be less likely to experience increases in BMI (Dur et al., 2011). Social connectivity has also been associated with lower BMI (Diez Roux and Mair, 2010). Kramer et al. (2016) find that the geographic variation in obesity rates is associated with the activity environment and availability of recreational facilities, but not the nutrition environment. They find that socioeconomic status is strongly correlated with county-level obesity as well. Slack et al. (2014) find that obesity is positively correlated with unemployment and less education, and negatively correlated with physician numbers. They also find that the effect of the food environment does not have a significant effect on obesity rates. This accords with the review study conducted by Cobb et al. (2015), who find limited evidence for the role of the local food environment on obesity (though they warn to interpret this result cautiously due to the low quality of the available studies on the topic). Sanchez-Vaznaugh et al. (2008) finds that longer residence in the United States is associated with greater BMI for foreign-born adults. However, many of these papers describe associative relationships, and not necessarily causal ones.====This paper contributes to the growing literature that seeks to disentangle causality from correlation in the context of neighborhood effects on health and BMI. While there is mounting evidence that particular aspects of communities, such as availability of fast food restaurants or grocery stores, do not matter for obesity or healthy eating, I attempt to paint a broader picture of the effect of neighborhoods as a whole on BMI. In my context, neighborhood can reflect both the availability of food options, as well as other physical characteristics such as the availability of green spaces, or peer effects. Instead of investigating each particular factor separately, I find evidence that suggests that neighborhoods as a whole may not matter for obesity and BMI. The previous literature provides the more specific mechanisms and factors for why this may be true.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 documents the data. Section 3 discusses the empirical framework and identification strategy. Section 4 presents the results. Section 5 presents robustness checks.

Our identification relies on the exploitation of the exogenous variations of the maximum UI weekly benefits across states and over years. Instead of focusing on all unemployed people, we concentrate on those who are eligible for UI benefits. We find that when the maximum UI weekly benefit level increases by $100, ==== increases by approximately 2.9 percentage points among the UI-eligible unemployed. The results are robust to various model specifications. We also explore the mechanism and find suggestive evidence that the increase in the maximum UI weekly benefit leads to a decrease in the probability of over-work of the respective spouse. Moreover, the unemployed who are less educated are more responsive to the increasing UI benefits.","The smoking rate among the U.S. population has been declining since 1995, because the government has invested considerable efforts to control tobacco and related substance abuse. The current smoking rate among adults (aged 18 years or older) has declined from 20.9% in 2005 to 16.8% in 2014 (C.D.C, 2014)====. However, the trend varies significantly among labor force groups. Smoking prevalence among the unemployed is much higher than that among the employed (Fig. 1). Specifically, in 1995, approximately 36% of the unemployed and approximately 26% of the employed smoked. Although smoking prevalence in both groups has gradually decreased since 1995, smoking prevalence among the unemployed has reduced much more slowly than that among the employed. In 2011, the smoking prevalence rate among the unemployed was approximately 30%, nearly twice as high as that among the employed.====High smoking prevalence among the unemployed population has been paid increasing attention in recent decades. The literature provides substantial evidence for unemployment resulting in a high possibility for the unemployed to exhibit health-risk behaviors (Bolton and Rodriguez, 2009; Classen and Dunn, 2012; Deb et al., 2011; Falba et al., 2005; Kuhn et al., 2009; Montgomery et al., 1998), including hazardous drinking, excessive amount of cigarette consumption, and heavy dependence on illicit and prescription drugs====. The transition to unemployment implies a consequential future earning loss (Jacobson et al., 1993) and is associated with psychological distress (Tefft, 2011; Thomas et al., 2005). Cigarettes as well as alcohol and drugs are universally viewed as methods of dealing with stressful and uncontrollable social or economic problems for short-term pressure relief (Jarvis and Wardle, 1999)====.====Hazardous health behaviors during unemployment impose remarkably negative impacts on the unemployed. As an apparent outcome, the unemployed are at a high risk of a deterioration in not only their physical health (e.g., a high risk of cardiovascular diseases (Walter et al., 2014), strokes (Gallo et al., 2004, 2006), and mortality (Browning and Heinesen, 2012; Clemens et al., 2009; Eliason and Storrie, 2009; Sullivan and Wachter, 2009)), but also mental disorders (Bartley, 1994; Gallo et.al, 2006; Mandal et al., 2011). This results in a substantial social cost. For the entire population, from 2000 to 2012, the U.S. tobacco-related health care cost amounted to $133 billion====. With an increase in the prevalence of smoking in the unemployed population, tobacco-related health care costs may also substantially increase in this population. Moreover, unemployment induces people, particularly young people, to establish life-long patterns of hazardous behaviors (Montgomery et al., 1998), forming a vicious cycle; these risk behaviors subsequently increase the likelihood of future unemployment and decrease the possibility of finding and holding down a job (Henkel, 2011).====Although smoking prevalence among the unemployed is a major concern, few government programs for smoking problems are specifically designed to target this population. In this paper, we use the unemployment insurance (UI) benefit system, the largest U.S. safety net program during the Great Recession (Bitler and Hoynes, 2016), as an example and substantiate whether increasing UI benefits reduces smoking among unemployed workers, which is a scarcely discussed topic in the literature on UI. We believe that this research offers valuable policy insights into the problem of smoking among unemployed workers.====This paper uses the data from the U.S. Current Population Survey-Tobacco Use Supplements (CPS-TUS) from 1995 to 2011, except 2000====, to explore the effects of increasing UI benefits on the smoking behavior of the UI-eligible unemployed by exploiting the exogenous variations of maximum UI benefits across states and over the years. We merge the state maximum UI weekly benefit data with the CPS-TUS data. Consistent with the previous literature (e.g., Kenkel et al., 2014; Liu, 2010), we define two binary types of smoking behaviors: current smoking participation and smoking cessation over the past year. Considering the eligibility of the UI recipiency, we divide the unemployed sample into four groups: involuntary job losers, job leavers, those with recall expectations, and re-/new entrants (Krueger and Mueller, 2010). We investigate the effects of UI benefits on involuntary job losers who have been unemployed for less than 26 weeks==== because they are UI-eligible and likely to receive UI benefits. They are supposed to be affected by the UI policy changes. We discuss the sample construction in the following sections.====Our empirical results reveal that the generous UI program can significantly increase smoking cessation among the UI-eligible unemployed. With the maximum UI weekly benefit level increasing by $100, smoking cessation can increase by approximately 2.9 percentage points. In addition, those who face more severe unemployment shocks benefit more from the state UI policy expansion. For example, less-educated unemployed individuals are more responsive to UI benefits, indicating that to a certain extent, the vulnerable population that needs social assistance the most may benefit more from the UI benefits. Moreover, the UI benefits expansion also exerts positive spillover effects on the spouse of the unemployed; specifically, when unemployed workers receive higher UI benefits, their spouses are less likely to over-work because the increasing UI benefits ease the family’s financial pressure caused by the unemployment. Finally, we also discuss the potential sample selection bias. Our results are relatively robust according to a series of tests.====Our paper contributes to the literature in several aspects. First, in contrast to previous studies on smoking, which have used the entire unemployment population, we construct and focus on a more precise UI-eligible unemployed sample. The advantages of the UI-eligible sample allow us to directly estimate the health effects of UI on the UI-targeted population; thus, the effects would not be masked by the UI-ineligible population in the total unemployed. Second, this study is among the few to address the effects of UI on individuals’ health behaviors. We consider the smoking behavior as an example, which provides an alternative insight into the association between health and the UI policy benefits. Third, we provide suggestive evidence for the UI alleviating financial pressure by comparing the heterogeneous effects of UI benefits across subgroups with different levels of financial pressure and by investigating the effects of UI on the over-work probability of the spouse.====Our paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we provide a brief introduction of the state UI policy; in Section 3, we review the relevant literature; in Section 4, we describe the data sources and construction of the sample; in Section 5, we explain the identification strategy and model specification; in Section 6, we present the baseline results and robustness tests; in Section 7, we discuss the heterogeneous effects of UI benefits on the labor market outcomes of unemployed people’s spouse; and in Section 8, we present the conclusion.",Unemployment insurance and cigarette smoking,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629618300560,January 2019,2019,Research Article,344.0

We find a positive and statistically significant association between migration, its timing and physical health for migrant females, which we show are likely to represent rural females in both the early and the late cohort. We find less defined evidence of migration-health association for mental health. We link our findings to the economic transition and labor market transformation that Italy witnessed in that era. Male migrants were likely to be positively selected to migration, but harsh working conditions were likely to downplay this differential. On the contrary, women migrants, by and large, would not engage in the formal labor market avoiding the ill effects of working environments, at the same time benefiting from better living conditions and ==== in the destination regions.","The analysis of migration flows, their determinants and effects on a wide range of socio-economic phenomena have received extensive attention in the literature. The seminal contributions are those of Chiswick (1978) and Carliner (1980) who use cross-section of earning functions to investigate earning profiles for native born and immigrants in the United States. Jasso and Rosenzweig (1986) and Borjas, 1985, Borjas, 1987 extended this analysis using panel data techniques that allowed for the disentangling of aging from cohort effects. These, and other similar analyses, have focused either on the determinants of migration decisions or on the effects of migration on labor market outcomes and earnings and have been mostly confined to the United States. More recently, Antolin and Bover (1997) and Giannetti (2001) have explored migration related issues within Europe, investigating why the rate of European Union internal migration has been very low, despite the pronounced regional disparities which persist in many European Union countries.====The relationship between migration decisions and migrant health status (especially in the long-run) still remains a relatively unexplored topic in the economics literature. According to Hull (1979) individual health status can affect migration decisions (the health selection hypothesis), and migration can affect the health of those who move (due to disruption of individual life and adaptation to new environments and due to better health care services in the hosting country), those who stay (due to remittances from migrants), and perhaps even the health of the hosting populations (due to diffusion of new pathologies and/or new life styles). From an economic standpoint, understanding the effect of migration on health status is important for several reasons. In terms of economic growth the “healthy body” drain could negatively affect sending countries and benefit hosting counties. In addition, this drain could have significant long-term public finance consequences for origin and destination countries. In fact, the benefits of increasing productivity and higher economic growth due to migration flows could be counter-balanced by long-term health care and social assistance costs if migration results in deteriorating health status. The relevance of these problems has been magnified in recent years as migration flows have dramatically increased.====Italy has had a relatively unique migration experience, which makes it a valuable case study. Migration took place in two concentrated episodes, the first abroad and the second within Italy from the South and Northeast regions (often collectively referred to as the South) to the Northwestern and Central regions near the capital city of Rome (collectively referred to as the North). These migration flows were a direct consequence of particularly harsh living conditions in the South and were accompanied by two secular societal changes. First, employment for women virtually collapsed. Second, the agricultural sector shrank dramatically, especially in the Northwest, as industrialization made rapid strides. The historical record shows that men led the migration process and that women and children followed, i.e., men went to the North for “work reasons”, while women followed for “family reasons” (Bonifazi and Heins, 2000, Favero and Tassello, 1978).====In this paper, we study the health effects of internal migration from the Southern regions of Italy to the Northwestern ones and to the Central region around Rome, which was concentrated over a relatively short period of time from 1950 to 1970. We thus analyze the differences in current health status at the origin between migrants and non-migrants, in relation to differences in living conditions between the South and the destination regions. Our study provides a substantial contribution to the existing literature.====First, we provide a thorough analysis of the effects of migration on health by distinguishing between the decision to migrate and the time of exposure to living conditions in the South prior to migration. We do so by exploiting the information on the region of birth and that of residence of each person and the age at which the migration occurred within or out of the Southern area. We thus identify the association between migration and health based on the migration decision and the marginal effect of an additional year of exposure to the origin location. Second, although the estimates are not produced in a proper causal framework, we try to address some of the selection issues typical of the migration studies. We reweight the sample such that the covariates distribution between migrants and stayers groups are alike. For this purpose we use entropy balancing (Hainmueller, 2012) to estimate weights that balance covariates within each cohort. Also, in order to wash out possible unobserved heterogeneities and improve the precision of our estimates on the decision to migrate and its timing across various destination areas, we employ finite mixture models. Additionally, we produce our estimates conditional on individual height, which is likely to grasp to some extent the effects of migrant selection on health. Third, we quantify the above-mentioned associations after a substantial time lag, by comparing the health status of migrants and non-migrants after 30–40 years from migration. In fact, our sample consists of two cohorts of individuals, both born in the Southern regions of Italy, which comprise the set of potential migrants in the early wave and the late wave of migration within Italy. Four, the setting of the analysis is particularly favorable, as we examine the phenomenon of internal migration within a relatively small country. As such, barriers relative to legal aspects, culture, language and travel costs between the origin and the destination regions were considerably minor than it would be in case of international comparisons.====There are many intuitive reasons to expect health-effects of migration to be heterogeneous across the population. We distinguish between effects on women and men as we expect the existence of important differences driven by gender specific work experiences in the regions of origin and destination. We also distinguish the experience of “early” migrants from that of “late” migrants, as health effects of migration are likely to be influenced by whether the migrants were “pioneers”. Moreover, since the living conditions and labor market opportunities changed across the origin and destination regions and over time, it is likely the case that the relative health effects of migration are different. We also expect heterogeneous effects according to the type of migration, precisely, whether it was rural–urban or urban–urban. While the data at hand do not provide us with this type of information, we elicit this unobserved heterogeneity employing finite mixture models.====In what follows, Section 2 introduces a short review of the literature on the relationship between health status and migration decision. Section 3 provides a historical overview of internal migration in Italy since the second World War. Section 4 describes the data source, samples and variables. Next we describe our empirical strategy and the econometric model in Section 5. Section 6 presents the descriptive statistics of our variables followed by the empirical results and discussion.

While there is general agreement that advances in medical technologies underlie much of this improvement, there is less consensus surrounding the role of insurance as a facilitator of access to life-saving treatments. I analyze this link in the context of expenditures for Medicaid prescription drug coverage, which was extended to low income households during the program's early years.====Recent studies of broader health insurance expansions, such as Medicare implementation and the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, have emphasized the financially protective role of health insurance (Finkelstein and McKnight, 2008, Baicker et al., 2013). One reason for this focus involves lack of strong evidence of health or mortality effects (Finkelstein et al., 2012, Baicker et al., 2013); faced with a life or death choice, we expect patients will choose to get treatment if at all possible. This raises the question of when, if ever, insurance might play an essential role as a facilitator of access to life-saving treatments.====Existing evidence suggests a variety of reasons why prescription drug coverage may play an important role in ensuring access and adherence to courses of therapy. First, several studies find high responsiveness to copays for drugs (Chandra, Gruber, and McKnight, 2010; Johnson et al., 1997, or Soumerai et al., 1991, Soumerai et al., 1994). Second, adherence rates are often low, even for life threatening diseases (Baicker et al., 2012, Choudhry et al., 2011, Federman et al., 2001, or Steinman et al., 2001). Finally, obtaining prescriptions requires regular access to medical professionals. I examine the potential effects of expenditures resulting from prescription drug expansions for the poor with these considerations in mind.====Medicaid implementation provides a unique opportunity to study the effect of prescription drug expenditures on mortality because states had significant flexibility regarding timing of adoption and which services and populations to cover (beyond those mandated). Prescription drugs were one such service; while their financing benefited from federal support, states were not obligated to provide drug coverage to their Medicaid beneficiaries. I evaluate the effectiveness of these drug coverage expansions by measuring the effect of the associated drug spending on mortality. With wide variation in the breadth and timing of drug coverage expansions, I use an instrument to isolate plausibly exogenous variation in prescription drug spending. This instrument, which reflects the differential expansions over time and across states, serves to remove endogeneity between prescription drug expenditures and other unobservables that might be correlated with mortality.====I find that Medicaid prescription drug spending reduced state-level mortality. Overall, when states increase Medicaid prescription drug expenditures by $1 per state resident, state-wide mortality from internal causes drops by 2.0 deaths per hundred thousand, a decline of 0.23% from an average of 859 deaths per hundred thousand. Disease-group results are consistent with aggregate improvements in life expectancy, as these mortality gains are disproportionately concentrated among cardiovascular, circulatory, respiratory, and infectious diseases. The reduction in all internal-cause mortality resulting from Medicaid drug spending suggests a cost per death averted of roughly $49,600 and cost per life-year saved of $19,600 (in 2013 dollars).====The science around heart disease and its treatments provides the opportunity to perform some interesting falsification tests. For example, beta-blockers were available during this time frame and were indicated for the treatment of hypertension. However, I should only find an effect for hypertensive diseases which pose a serious risk of near-term death since I analyze contemporaneous mortality. I find that deaths from malignant hypertension, which poses serious risk of near-term death, declined significantly. On the other hand, I find no effect on essential benign hypertension, which usually takes decades to cause serious risk of death. Also, while modern science has revealed that beta-blockers lower the risk of death from congestive heart failure (CHF), at the time they were specifically contraindicated for these patients because it was believed that the drugs would exacerbate the condition. Since the only other CHF therapies available at the time have since been shown clinically to have no effect on mortality, there should be no effect of prescription drug expenditures on this disease. As expected, I find no effect of prescription drug spending on mortality from CHF.====I also use the fact that I am studying the effect of ==== prescription drug expenditures to see how the mortality effects vary by county. Since Medicaid eligibility is based on having a low income, I would expect that for a given level of state spending on pharmaceuticals, poor counties which receive more of the state funds should see a larger effect on mortality than rich counties. For non-southern counties, I do find that the effect is indeed much larger in poor counties: when states increase Medicaid prescription drug expenditures by $1 per state resident, mortality declines in poor counties by 1.76%, but is unchanged in wealthy counties. For southern counties, there is less heterogeneity, but the low and medium poverty counties have no statistically significant effect while the high poverty counties have a weakly significant effect.====Since obtaining a prescription requires access to medical professionals, I also investigate how the effect of prescription drug spending on mortality varies by certain characteristics of the health care market. If appointment availability is limited, the effectiveness of a prescription drug program could be diminished. In addition, if certain areas tend to have a bigger focus on using medicine for disease treatment rather than surgery (when both are viable), then I would expect to find a larger effect of state drug spending in areas where medicine is utilized at a relatively higher rate than surgery. With this in mind, I evaluate the effect of Medicaid drug spending on mortality for areas with a low, medium, or high number of physicians per capita, and also for areas with a low, medium, or high ratio of medical to surgical physicians.====My results indicate that counties with a low number of physicians per capita have essentially no effect of prescription drug spending on mortality, while counties in the highest tercile of physicians per capita have a much larger effect. In these high physician-to-population counties, I find that when states increase Medicaid prescription drug expenditures by $1 per state resident, mortality declines by 0.27% for all internal causes. I also find that the medical versus surgical focus of a county is important for the effect of prescription drug coverage. In areas with a high medical to surgical physician ratio, the internal-cause mortality reduction from $1 in prescription drug spending per state resident is 0.30%, but there is essentially no effect in areas with a low ratio.====These estimates are among the first quasi-experimental results to find a strong link between prescription drug coverage and mortality. The results show that not only did prescription drug coverage play an important role in achieving Medicaid's primary goal of improving the health of the poor, it also contributed to the overall life expectancy gains in the United States made since the 1960s.

Many health care markets, such as nursing homes, home health care, and hospice, have a meaningful mix of both for-profit and nonprofit providers.==== In this paper, we present a general theoretical framework for nonprofit and for-profit coexistence, with an empirical application to the hospice industry in particular.====The hospice industry has grown tremendously over the past 15 years, serving an estimated 1.6 to 1.7 million patients in 2014. Approximately 40 percent of Medicare decedents used three or more days of hospice services in 2014 (NHPCO, 2015). Although there is a well-developed literature on ownership differences in hospitals (See Sloan (2000) for a summary), nursing homes and hospice care markets have significant differences; providers are smaller and more capacity constrained and care is provided over longer periods of time. In our theoretical framework, we show these characteristics affect the assortment of patients who are served, and that the type of patients served depends on ownership type. We find that hospice markets with a mix of both nonprofit and for-profit providers serve a greater range of patient types than those markets served by only for-profit or only nonprofit hospices. Having two ownership types actually expands the range of consumers being served.====The market in our theoretical framework provides a good or service which is consumed over extended time periods. The key dimensions which differentiate this market are that consumers are heterogeneous in expected number of consumption periods and that the service may have benefits which accrue to individuals other than the consumer (or accrue beyond current consumption, either to the direct consumer or to individuals other than the consumer.) This spillover of benefits beyond the direct consumer interacts with the heterogeneous types to make different segments of the market more desirable to each ownership type.====The driving difference between the nonprofit and for-profit firm is that nonprofits can accept donations from (or on behalf of) the consumer. Donations occur after a consumption spell directly from the consumer, or can result from benefits of the service that accrue to others (for example, “in lieu of flowers” donations). Firms are price takers and capacity constrained. This means that referral networks and targeting are important to fill capacity with the most profitable consumers. There is a high initial fixed cost (e.g., a set-up cost) to serving each consumer and a constant per unit-of-time cost, so that firms’ average cost curves exhibit increasing returns in service duration. Consumers are heterogenous in the number of periods they expect to consume the service, which cannot be changed by the services provided by the firm. If payment is only per period of service, then short-stay consumers (consuming fewer units of time) will be less profitable than long-stay consumers. However, per consumer donations cause the incentive structures to diverge between the two ownership types. With per consumer donations, taking many short-stay consumers may be more profitable to the nonprofit rather than taking fewer long-stay consumers, with fewer associated donations. If this is the case, nonprofit and for-profit firms now have different target populations within the heterogenous consumer base, even if both behave like simple profit-maximizers.====Three main behavioral predictions emerge from the theoretical framework. First, nonprofit firms should focus on consumer types with shorter expected durations of consumption and combine the per unit-of-time revenue with end-of-stay donation revenues. Second, nonprofits should focus more on components of the service which have a greater donation potential. Third, of particular innovation in this work, because nonprofit and for-profit firms each focus on a different segment of the heterogeneous consumers, markets with a mix of ownerships should see a wider range of consumers served along the dimension of heterogeneity.====We test this theoretical framework using data from the U.S. hospice industry, 2000–2008. Our data captures over 90 percent of all U.S. freestanding hospice providers during this period. For the years 2002–2005, we also link hospice firms directly to the 100% Medicare beneficiary data, providing controls for individual patient characteristics by hospice as well as firm-level characteristics. Hospice care provides comfort, pain relief, and social services to patients with a terminal diagnosis at the end of life. Care is delivered in various settings, most often a patient's home, but also in nursing homes and occasionally institutional settings. Care is not curative, but instead palliative, so many of the services focus on nursing visits to improve comfort or social services to help the patient and family address end-of-life issues. The predominant payor in the market is Medicare, with 90.3 percent of patient days from 1.7 million patients in 2014 covered by the Medicare hospice benefit. In our empirical section, we show that the trends in hospice market patient mix during 2000–2008 match the predictions from the theoretical framework described above. For-profit hospices focus on patient diagnoses with long expected stays in hospice, such as Alzheimer's disease and dementia, as per our first prediction. Nonprofits target the short-stay portion of demand, such as cancer patients. We show that nonprofits focus more on bereavement services, a service that is practicably nonexcludable in nature.==== Bereavement services benefit the patient's family and loved ones, even after Medicare reimbursement ends and so may serve to encourage ==== donations. Finally, we offer evidence that local markets with an even balance of nonprofit and for-profit firms actually serve a wider range of patient types, as measured through average length of stay.====Previous work on ownership types has focused on how for-profits may provide lower levels of desirable characteristics, such as quality (for example, Sloan et al. (2001), Glaeser and Shleifer (2001), Eggleston et al. (2008), and Chou (2002)), quantity (for example, Horwitz and Nichols (2009), Jacobson and Chang (2017)), or treatment choice and control (for example, Bayindir (2012), Dalton and Warren (2016)). On the other side of the coin, there is a literature that focuses on the equivalence in behavior between for-profit and nonprofit firms – “for-profits in disguise.” These papers often find little difference across the two types in terms of costs, patient mix, or quality, beginning with Weisbrod (1988). One of the important contributions of this paper is we show conditions where nonprofits and for-profits bring independent benefits to the market. In contrast to existing theoretical and empirical research, we show the existence of both types of firm in the same market actually expands the range of consumers who will be served.====One important exception is Lakdawalla and Philipson (2006), who model nonprofits with a competitive advantage due to a preference for output, which makes these firms the more stable incumbents, whereas for-profit firms are more likely to enter on the margin. However, this behavior is due to different optimization goals. In our work, we will show how mixed ownership in a market can actually arise from underlying heterogeneity in market demand, without nonprofit preference for output, altruism, quality, etc. Nearly all the nonprofit behavior literature explains nonprofit presence through differences in objectives, or in the dimension of market information. One notable exception is David (2009), who shows that changes in economic environments alter firms’ incentives to remain nonprofit. Our paper offers a unique contribution by showing conditions where underlying heterogeneity in consumer types can lead to profitability that is ownership-specific.====Finally, our empirical work contributes to the growing need to document firm behavior in the hospice industry. Previous summary work has been laid out by Lindrooth and Weisbrod (2007), Connor et al. (2004), Noe and Forgione (2014), and Gandhi (2012). This paper provides an exceptionally complete look at the freestanding hospice market, with approximately 90 percent of freestanding hospice firms over nine years. This is also the first paper, to our knowledge, to link the firm data to individual beneficiary data.====Our paper makes three main contributions to understanding firm behavior in mixed ownership markets. First, we are able to explain why a market may have a nontrivial presence of both firms, vs. an equilibrium with one dominant ownership type. Second, we show that this coexistence of ownership types can persist even without differences in firm preferences for output, quality, or as a result of information asymmetries. Instead, our innovation is that nonprofit and for-profit firms may both exist in a market because of differences in underlying market structure, in particular, from heterogeneity in consumer demand and the differential treatment of donations made by consumers (or others) to firms. Finally, our empirical evaluation of the hospice market is important; we demonstrate conditions where, instead of for-profits being inferior or nonprofits being merely for-profits in disguise, both firms’ participation benefits consumers by leading to a wider range of patients being served than in the absence of this diversity.====Section 2 lays out a theoretical framework for a market with nonprofit and for-profit firms, along with behavioral predictions for each ownership type. Section 3 details the hospice industry and translates the behavioral predictions into testable empirical predictions. Our data is outlined in Section 4. The general econometric model is outlined and tested in Section 5. We test each of the three predictions and provide robustness tests.

Introducing behavioral biases into an extended version of their model, I show that their proposed methodology implicitly assumes that consumer dietary choices do not involve any health considerations. The cost per quality-adjusted life year that they compute should be corrected by the size of the bias of consumers to be compared with benchmark evaluations.","Unhealthy diet, together with other behaviors (lack of physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption), is a major health risk factor (e.g. Murray et al., 2013, for the U.S.). Policies influencing people's diet are therefore likely to have major impacts on health. How to apply the standard economic tools of cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) to evaluate such policies is not straightforward. It requires to compute the cost for consumers of changing their diet, and compare it to the health benefits, and necessitates to take into account the likely bias (either informational or behavioral) of consumers.====Irz et al. (2015) evaluate nutritional recommendations (e.g. share of fruits and vegetables, quantity of salt in the diet), by coupling an economic model with an epidemiological model. They model the consequences of a nutritional recommendation as a ==== on consumers choices, mobilizing the theory of optimal rationing (Jackson, 1991). Their contribution is notably to simulate the whole adjustment of consumers’ diets following the implementation of such a constraint. They determine the ‘taste cost’ for consumers of several nutritional constraints and their health consequences (measured in Death Avoided). The cost is computed as the amount necessary to compensate the consumer for the constraint. Dividing the former by the latter they found a very low cost per DA, or Quality-Adjusted Life Year, and describe these recommendations as “highly cost-effective” (see also Irz et al., 2016a, Irz et al., 2016b).====The purpose of this comment is to qualify their conclusions by arguing that they implicitly assume that consumers do not take into account the health consequences of their diet choices. If consumers partially internalize these health consequences,==== the benefits from the nutritional recommendations should be reduced by the amount internalized in a CBA or CEA. The analysis is left unchanged if the change of diet is triggered by an information campaign that modifies the subjectives probabilities of adverse health consequences. The taste cost, computed by Irz et al. (2015), is then equal to the health benefits weighted by the change of subjective probabilities.====In Section 2, I review part of the literature on the regulation of food and the correction of biases. In Section 3, I introduce health and behavioral biases into the theoretical framework developed by Irz et al. (2015). In Section 4, an information campaign is considered. Section 5 introduces health care costs.
