We show that some of this regressivity is due to the regression-based estimation procedures used by many jurisdictions to calculate assessments. A review of existing measures of assessment regressivity suggests that severe biases associated with regression-based procedures make them much less useful than the traditional price-related differential (PRD) as a measure of vertical inequality. To supplement existing measures of vertical inequality, we propose approaches using Gini coefficients, Suits index, and kernel density tests to provide information on the relationship between the assessment and sale price distributions. We compute the measures using data on sales prices and assessments for 48 large central city counties. The results suggest that the PRD remains a useful approach for measuring vertical inequality due to its simplicity and familiarity, while distribution-based procedures are helpful because they are not as sensitive to small numbers of very high-priced sales. Together, the approaches provide a more complete picture of how assessment rates vary across the full distribution of sales prices.","Whether the statutory assessment rate is 100% or a fraction of market value, assessments are supposed to rise in proportion to market value in all jurisdictions in the United States. Although there is occasional debate concerning whether sale price is the appropriate measure of market value in all circumstances, there is widespread agreement that a comparison of sales prices and assessments will establish whether there is a systematic tendency for assessment rates to vary with market value when there are a large number of arm’s length sales that take place in typical market conditions. A large empirical literature suggests that residential assessments tend to be regressive in the sense that higher-priced properties tend to have lower assessment rates than low-priced properties.====
      ====The traditional measure of vertical inequality for assessments is the Price-Related Differential (PRD), which is simply the ratio of the arithmetic mean of the assessment ratio to the value-weighted mean, where the assessment ratio is defined as assessed value divided by sale price. The PRD is greater than 1 when high-priced properties tend to have lower assessment ratios than low-priced properties. Standards promulgated by the International Association of Assessing Officers (IAAO, 2017) call for PRDs between 0.98 and 1.03, with values greater than 1.03 implying regressivity and values below 0.98 implying progressivity. A significant advantage of the PRD over other measures is its widespread use, which provides ample context for determining whether departures from the IAAO standards are a serious problem. A disadvantage is that the PRD can be influenced heavily by a small number of very high-priced properties. A simple reporting error that leads to a $1 million property being recorded as $10 million can affect the PRD significantly.====Academic researchers tend to rely on regressions to evaluate vertical inequality. In an early study, Paglin and Fogarty (1972) regress assessments (A) on sales prices (P) and then test whether the intercept is significantly different from zero. Cheng (1974) regresses lnA on lnP and tests whether the coefficient on log sale price is significantly different from one. Clapp (1990) switches the dependent and explanatory variables and uses an instrumental variable in place of the actual value of lnA. The IAAO has recently promulgated a new measure, the Price-Related Bias (PRB), which is constructed by regressing the percentage deviation of the assessment ratio from its median on a measure of market value that is based on the average of a property’s sale price and its assessed value.====We show analytically that regression-based measures of vertical inequality are biased toward a finding of regressivity if some observations in the sample of sales used to examine regressivity were also used in calculating assessments. Indeed, when the two sets of data are identical, commonly used measures of regressivity automatically imply regressivity. When assessments are the predicted values from a linear hedonic sale price regression, a linear regression of assessed values on sales prices can never imply progressivity: the coefficient on sale price is simply the ==== from the original hedonic sale price regression, and the intercept cannot be negative. The same conclusion holds if assessments are calculated using the log of sale price as the dependent variable and assessment performance is evaluated using a regression of log assessed values on log sales prices. A regression of the log of assessment ratios on log sale price also produces coefficients that are directly related to the ==== from the original hedonic log sale price regression, and again the regression cannot imply progressivity.====Moreover, regression-based methods for evaluating assessments are biased by common misspecification problems. For example, if assessments are calculated using a log-linear model while a linear model is used to evaluate regressivity, the resulting measure of vertical inequality will generally be biased. Similarly, the regressivity measure will be biased if assessed values are calculated using a linear model and a log-linear model is used to measure regressivity.====Regression-based approaches share the objective behind the PRD of having a single statistic that indicates the degree of vertical inequality. Although the PRD remains a useful simple summary statistic of vertical inequality, relying exclusively on a single summary measure neglects a wealth of potentially interesting information that can be revealed by analyzing the full distribution of assessments. McMillen, 2011, McMillen, 2013 uses kernel density and quantile approaches to show graphically how the distribution of assessment ratios varies with sales prices. He finds that assessment rates in Chicago not only tend to be extremely high at very low sales prices, but are also much more variable. In this study, we suggest using three additional approaches to summarize the overall relationship between the distributions of sales prices and assessed values – the difference in Gini coefficients, a Suits Index, and a nonparametric test for the difference between the kernel density function estimates.====Our simulations also indicate that using regressions to calculate assessed values creates regressivity. Using the predicted values from a house price regression to calculate assessments causes assessed values to be higher than the actual sales price for low-priced properties and lower than the sale price for high-priced properties. Of course, other factors may also lead to regressive assessments. For example, failure to control adequately for location, a small number of sales in low-priced areas, and infrequent appraisals in areas where rates of appreciation vary by price, and a higher probability of appeals by owners of high-priced properties all may lead to regressivity. But even in the absence of these problems, regressivity is likely to be a problem whenever regressions are used to calculate assessed values.====We use a variety of approaches to calculate estimates of regressivity using data for the central counties of large cities across the US. In the main text, we focus on the central counties of four representative cities: Birmingham, AL; Indianapolis, IN; St. Louis, MO; and Tucson, AZ. The results for additional counties are presented in an appendix. Our conclusion is that regression-based approaches should not be used when assessments are calculated using hedonic sale price functions as doing so results in a finding of regressivity if some of the transactions used when calculating assessed values are also used to determine whether assessments are regressive. Regression-based approaches should only be used in the exceptional case where assessments are calculated as a function of sale price and the functional form is known to the analyst. Given that this situation is unlikely to ever occur in practice, the PRD is likely to remain the most useful single approach for measuring vertical inequality. We also argue that distribution-based procedures are a useful complement to the PRD because they are not as sensitive to small numbers of very high-priced sales and, when combined with kernel density functions, they provide a more complete picture of how assessment rates vary across the full distribution of sales prices.",Measures of vertical inequality in assessments,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137723000372,Available online 8 June 2023,2023,Research Article,0.0

Theoretically, neither price nor income, housing allowance schemes are universal across countries in functional form and manifest as ==== inverse to resources i.e., some benefit minus income deduction. New Zealand's Accommodation Supplement (AS) manifests as a negative income and wealth tax benefit which, over time, is regressive to rents and incomes. Empirically, I estimate the effects of an increase in costs and demand for the AS on rents exploiting a panel of housing markets geocoded using census tracts at Area Unit (AU) level. The rent model extends to incorporate spatial interactions using Geographically Weighted Panel Regressions (GWR) to control for any time-variant neighborhood spillover effects on rents. Costing NZ$ 5.225 billion over 2006-2013, AS for renters was not demand deterministic and had no significant direct impact on the revenues of low-income landlords. An increase in subsidy demand coincides with possible overcrowding whereas has no impact on increasing rental supply or a move into renting.","Recent empirical literature on housing allowances, in general, posits that rent inflation would result from the programmes reliance on the market to satisfy the ‘subsidized’ demand, given the short-run inelasticity of housing supply (Fack, 2006; Gibbons & Manning, 2006; Grislain-Letrémy & Trevien, 2016; Kangasharju, 2010; Laferrère & Le Blanc, 2004; Susin, 2002; Viren, 2013). In this paper, I challenge the price theory, as applied in empirical literature, and provide new evidence on the incidence of New Zealand's (NZ) housing allowance, known as the Accommodation Supplement (AS), on rents. For this, I draw upon a plausibly exogenous large increase in the take-up and cost of AS between 2006 and 2013 to analyze how such shifts affected price of rental housing once AS demand stabilized around 2012. These increases are arguably based on a marketing campaign by the Ministry of Social Development for targeting eligible people to take-up the AS following policy changes in AS eligibility thresholds and increases in AS maxima in 2004 and 2005 respectively.====My paper aims to provide an explicit theory for housing allowances based on investigations on their algorithm combined with empirical work. On the mechanism of housing allowances, I explore the AS algorithm, its design, and associated threshold parameters with respect to the AS policy's position and impact on economic behaviour. Upon revealing the AS being a personal subsidy and an extension of the negative income tax (NIT) benefit formula (Friedman, 1962), I argue similar theoretical predictions that underlie the NIT benefit would follow through for AS monies, in addition to certain peculiarities that uniquely identify the AS benefit. That is, the NIT benefit has a structural advantage where it does not distort market prices which minimum wages, tariffs and price subsidies tend to do (Friedman, 1962). This replaces price theory of demand applied in the literature. My findings reveal that poor renters do not respond to demand-side incentives labelled as housing allowances. The study proposes new insights on the relationship of (unconstrained) housing allowances and their impact on housing outcomes.====The modern housing allowance is a cash transfer which is an entitlement if poor enough (Nordvik & Sørvoll, 2014). In most advanced countries, this is available to the poor that rent, board, or have a mortgage subject to a means test. In general, the housing allowance algorithm is universal across countries in its structure and functional form i.e., benefit minus income deduction (see OECD Affordable Housing Database for comparison between 69 measures of housing allowances in 38 countries.)====. In almost all cases, the benefit is ==== downward using incomes, including income from assets in certain jurisdictions====. Of recent, public spending on housing allowances to the private sector is close to 0.5% of GDP in New Zealand, similar to the UK. In 2013, renters constituted approximately 73% of total cost of the allowance in NZ. Housing allowance in New Zealand is similar, to an extent, to those in the anglosphere having a ‘liberal’ social welfare regime where the social security system is a marginal one (Esping-Andersen, 1990). Whereas some European countries share the basic formula with these and other European nations, notably Scandinavian nations, and The Netherlands, in contrast, have highly decommodified schemes (Colburn, 2021).====A large social experiment in the US known as Experimental Housing Allowance Program (EHAP) pioneered in the 1970s found that housing allowances had no significant impact on market rents (Frieden, 1980; Lowry, 1982; Rydell, Neels, & Barnett, 1982). Of recent, a detailed literature review was commissioned in New Zealand by the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) to assess research on impacts of housing allowances on rents (Brackertz et al., 2015). The authors arrived at the conclusion that, to date, research for New Zealand is not reliable due to various limitations on modeling techniques and data suitability. A later study using Difference-in-Differences estimation by Hyslop and Rea (2019) although finds AS to increase rents.====To address Brackertz et al. (2015) concerns on data and methods suitability to address the research question and study limitations that draw into question the utility of study findings, I estimate the effect of a relatively large increase in the demand and cost of the Accommodation Supplement on rents, geocoded using census tracts at the Area Unit (AU) level, by constructing a panel dataset using census data and sourcing administrative data from government agencies. The data is at the Area Unit population level for all data sets. Notably, my rent model extends to incorporate spatial interactions as well to control for neighborhood effects on sub-market rents as the analysis is using pre-defined housing sub-markets as per census delineations (Bibby et. al, 2007; Crook & Hughes, 2001). This rise in demand for AS over 2005-2011 represents one of the largest increases in the demand for AS since the inception of a dualist housing policy in 2001. The period provides us with disruptions in an otherwise stable universal housing allowance scheme. I draw upon this plausibly exogenous variation and individual area fixed effects to identify the short to medium term change in rental markets associated with an increased demand and cost for the AS.====Findings show that the increase in AS take-up including cost had no statistically significant impact on the rents of the low-income renter over the study period. Low-income housing landlords experienced no direct revenue gains from a NZ$ 5.225 billion expense bill for the AS over this period. This finding lends evidence to the argument put forward here that an unconstrained marginal housing allowance scheme accessed post-housing-costs does not, in theory, have a deterministic relationship with housing outcomes. It seemingly is neither accepted as permanent income nor is it perceived as a price cut by recipients, at least, with respect to housing outcomes. Similar findings were reported by Eerola & Lyytikäinen (2021) for the universe of HA recipients although their theoretical model contradicts their findings. Such findings are in line with the argument that the AS allowance algorithm manifests as a negative income and wealth tax benefit which is not market distortionary ==== (Friedman, 1962). At the broader market level, I find an increase in housing subsidy costs and take-up to coincide with deflated AU market rents. This is intuitive at the population level as AS dollars otherwise are not deterministic in affecting housing demand of low-income renters their data generating process is, nonetheless, inverse (negative sign) to all incomes (earned and benefit income) whereas AS cohort changes would impact area market rents akin to poverty changes.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. I first describe the allowance scheme's algorithm and eligibility in section 2. Section 3 informs how housing allowances, using AS as an example, function with respect to rents, incomes, indexation and their economic predictions with new insights including limitations on applying the ==== theory for allowances. It compares the US Housing Choice Voucher design with the AS. This is followed by a review of prior research. Section 5 describes the empirical strategy. Descriptions of the sample and data characteristics are presented in section 6. Section 7 provides the results followed by a discussion and conclusion.",Can Landlords Siphon Housing Allowances?

We investigate this issue in the context of property taxes, exploring how accurately households perceive their property tax liabilities and what factors determine misperception. Leveraging a unique national dataset, created by linking Zillow's ZTRAX data to internal data from the American Community Survey, we first compare survey responses for how much households ==== they pay in property taxes to how much they ==== pay based on municipal administrative records from ZTRAX. While homeowner tax perceptions are not substantially biased on average, we observe significant inaccuracy and systematic bias across different household(er) characteristics, institutional settings, and across states. Given that the vast majority of studies in the property tax capitalization literature use data concentrated in one state or locality, we also explore whether variation in tax misperceptions across states can help explain the heterogeneity in property tax effects on home prices. Results from a meta-analysis show that studies conducted in states with higher property tax misperceptions are significantly less likely to find property tax policy changes are fully capitalized into home prices.","Collected from over 91 million owner-occupied households in the U.S., property taxes are a crucial source of revenue for state and local governments, amounting to over $615 billion (in 2020).==== Like other taxes, they also provide a mechanism for local policymakers to incentivize both economic and social objectives, including targeted exemptions and tax benefits for specific demographics (e.g., senior citizens or disabled veterans) or by socioeconomic status (e.g., low income/wealth households). Recent research is somewhat mixed, however, regarding whether and to what extent property tax policies effectively influence housing tenure and location decisions (e.g., Banzhaf et al., 2021; Kim and Dawkins 2021) or whether these policies work as intended (e.g., Bradley 2017; Moulton et al., 2018). In this paper, we dig deeper into why household reactions to property tax policy might be so mixed. In particular, we first evaluate the possibility that property tax salience may differ from household to household and, thus, misperceptions about property taxes may vary in different contexts. Using a unique dataset, internal American Community Survey (ACS) microdata linked to administrative property-level tax assessor records from Zillow's ZTRAX database, we investigate whether, and to what extent, there are systematic differences between how much households ==== they pay in property taxes versus what they ==== pay.==== We then explore whether tax misperceptions can help reconcile the heterogeneous impact of property tax policies on home prices found in the literature.====These questions are important to examine empirically because (1) the magnitude of property tax revenue is itself economically significant and is thus tied to a sizable literature examining determinants and responses from property tax policies,==== and (2) there is a documented, but yet unsolved, puzzle in the literature – namely, that households are expected to have a better understanding of their property taxes, but the empirical evidence often conflicts with this prediction. Specifically, economics provides numerous theoretical reasons that households should understand and incorporate the implications of property taxes, which in part hinge on the tax's absolute size and its tie to a large purchase (Chetty, Looney, and Croft 2007).==== Yet, the empirical literature is decidedly mixed on whether households actually understand these taxes very well or account for them rationally in their decision-making (Sirmans et al., 2008).====The flipside of this theory is that households will be less attentive to taxes that are smaller in magnitude, or normal ‘everyday’ purchases. Chetty et al. (2007) investigate sales tax salience and provide evidence that consumers are somewhat inattentive to taxes in this context. They explain that this response is understandable given that they examine small, frequent purchases: “more individuals pay attention to taxes when making large, one time choices (e.g. buying a house) than small, repeated purchases (e.g. food, clothing)” (Chetty et al., 2007, p. 34).==== In contrast, Bradley (2017), for example, examines the response of home purchases to Michigan's implementation of property tax assessment limits and finds that homebuyers were “woefully inattentive” to the tax implications of their home purchases, despite the theoretical prediction of a more attentive response.====Bradley (2017) fits within a broader, decades-long literature investigating how property taxes affect home prices, where buyers’ and sellers’ (mis)understanding of property taxes potentially plays an important role. That is, if property taxes are well-understood, and certain basic market conditions are met, then the taxes should be capitalized into the purchase price of a home. To illustrate, consider a stylized example where homebuyers are bidding on two identical homes (with identical structure characteristics, public services, and amenities – including location amenities), but one home happens to have substantially lower property taxes. If everyone expects the lower tax home to incur, say, $10,000 less taxes in net present value (NPV) terms over the life of the property, rational consumers would favor the tax-preferred asset, all else equal. As a result, they would be willing to bid a higher price – up to the point where their marginal benefit equals the marginal cost in a competitive market. Thus, in the short run, particularly when supply conditions are highly inelastic, we would expect an otherwise identical tax-preferred home to sell for more, where full capitalization is reached when the NPV of the expected tax benefit is included in the purchase price of the home (or, about $10,000 in the above example). In some circumstances, like if market conditions are imperfect, housing supply is relatively elastic, homebuyers are inattentive, or they simply do not understand the property tax implications, then the purchase price may partially (under) capitalize (<$10k in the example), overcapitalize (>$10k in the example), or not capitalize the differences at all ($0 difference in the example).====While numerous studies find local instances of full capitalization, a review of decades of research on property tax capitalization by Sirmans et al. (2008) concluded that most studies did not find evidence of full capitalization.==== The absence of uniform evidence for full capitalization naturally raises the following questions: 1) why is there so much variation in these findings, and 2) can variation in perceptions about property taxes help explain the heterogeneity in this literature? Given that the aforementioned studies are predominantly drawn from local, sub-national datasets, one factor that could explain the diverse impact of property tax policy is simply that these taxes are not uniformly salient across all households and settings; thus, systematic differences in misperceptions may be an important contributor to household responses.====We explore these questions empirically by using internal ACS microdata linked to administrative public tax records from Zillow's ZTRAX database. We first measure the difference between the (annual) amount of property taxes respondents report in the ACS survey compared to the corresponding tax amount actually assessed in the tax records. While many households report their property tax without much bias (as we find raw (signed) error is an underestimate of 1.4 percent of the actual tax assessed), the average absolute error is about 15 percent. Further, we find that misperception about property taxes varies systematically across household characteristics, institutional settings, and states.====When we investigate determinants of systematic differences in misperceptions, we find conditional correlations in the data consistent with the theoretical literature on inattention. Specifically, when households have greater motivation to devote attention to property taxes in terms of the size of the property tax base (home value) and property tax rate, we find these households tend to have lower levels of misperception or absolute error. Conversely, when property taxes are less important to the household, in particular when income (or an alternative tax base) is higher relative to home value, the household is less attentive to property taxes (in terms of absolute error). In addition, we find that factors capturing different levels of information costs (or gaps) also correspond with household misperceptions about property taxes. Householders without a college degree, that are younger, or that have lower income tend to misperceive property taxes to a greater degree. Further, households who pay their tax indirectly via mortgage escrow (i.e., with less visibility) also have greater absolute error in their estimates than those who pay directly without a mortgage. There is also variation in the way the inattention (absolute error) related to different characteristics manifests in terms of (signed) raw error, where in some cases we do not find evidence of a corresponding influence on raw error. However, in other cases, we observe that the inattention corresponds with a difference in raw error as well, which would be consistent with reliance on a systematic form of inattention like a heuristic.====In our final set of analyses, we pivot from evaluating household determinants of misperception to examining state-specific variation in misperception, given that prior studies in the property tax capitalization literature often use local, subnational datasets. We find there are substantial state-specific tax misperception differences, even after accounting for differences in property tax rates and other factors. Using these state-specific effects, we create indices for tax misperceptions by state, which allow us to conduct a simplified meta-analysis for the property tax capitalization literature. Overall, we find a significant association between the level of tax misperception in a state and whether the study that used data from that state observed a full capitalization result. That is, if a state has higher tax misperceptions (in terms of absolute error), it substantially reduces the likelihood that a study set in that state found a full capitalization result, on average. In fact, a key result from this analysis is that a substantial amount of heterogeneity in the property tax capitalization literature can be explained by cross-state variation in tax misperceptions over the period we study.====These results contribute to multiple strands of literature and are relevant for policymakers and future research. First, results from the linked microdata help characterize the size and direction of property tax misperception across the U.S., which is an important set of findings to document in its own right. Unlike other studies of tax salience and misperceptions, we are able to examine and directly assess the perception versus reality of tax assessments on a household level across the U.S. as a whole. This is only possible with national data like ZTRAX linked to ACS data and underscores the utility of such data for research where heterogeneity across states or groups could be important. Accordingly, our analysis of the determinants of tax misperception with this unique administrative data reveals which characteristics are associated with inaccuracy (absolute error) and systematic over/underestimation (raw error).====Second, the results from our simplified meta-analysis shed new light on the property tax capitalization literature and the importance of systematic differences in tax misperceptions. The aforementioned literature largely relies on inferences about household reactions to property taxes from particular local, state, or regional datasets; and, in more recent literature (e.g., Moulton et al., 2018), the inferences are based on evidence from a particular group's (seniors, veterans, etc.) reaction to a state or local policy change. The results here caution researchers from generalizing too broadly about how rational, well-informed, or attentive households are about taxes based on local or subgroup data, as our findings show systematic differences, incentives, and context can be important contributors to heterogeneous findings. Even if subsequent researchers use national data, systematic misperceptions across the subpopulations examined (e.g., by income level or age) may still confound variation in the results, depending on the study's research question. Thus, our results and state-level indices of property tax misperceptions provided in the Online Appendix may be useful for future research to exploit in additional analysis to scrutinize such concerns further.====Third, and more generally, our findings contribute to the literatures in public economics and tax accounting that examine explicit measures of misperceptions about taxes and their determinants. While this is the first U.S. study to examine the distribution and determinants of misperceptions about ==== taxes on a broad, representative sample, other studies have explored similar questions on misperceptions related to federal income taxes. This stream of research is often limited to much smaller, less representative samples (e.g., Enrick 1963, 1964; Fujii and Hawley 1988; Rupert and Fischer 1995; Ballard and Gupta 2018). Further, studies in this literature often must rely on calculated tax benchmark values based on characteristics of the household (e.g., whether respondents are high versus low income, own their home, are older, etc.) rather than tax assessor values when evaluating tax misperceptions (see Blaufus et al., 2022 for a detailed summary of this literature). Given the broad scope of our sample, our results underscoring the role of heterogeneity in household characteristics and geographic factors can shed new light on important issues for this literature to consider when making inferences with more limited data.====Finally, this analysis could be valuable for policymakers. For instance, if perceptions and salience about property taxes and capitalization differ across states/regions or certain demographics, distinctions by subpopulations will provide valuable information to policymakers interested in assessing whether these policies are more or less likely to impact homebuyer decisions in their local jurisdictions that vary along these dimensions.==== Moreover, future research questions about property tax policies may again require researchers to focus on limited subpopulations within the U.S. (e.g., with a unique policy change in a particular state or pertaining to a particular demographic that departs from the typical U.S. landscape). Identifying how different features of the population alter tax misperceptions and capitalization rates would help with understanding how results from these narrower settings may (or may not) generalize more broadly.",When Do Property Taxes Matter?

Banking deregulation together with states’ autonomy to limit deregulation provides an exogenous shift in credit supply which shows variation across states and time. We find that a shift from full to no regulation increases the probability of homeownership by one percentage point, and of having a mortgage by two percentage points, explaining up to 43% of the increase in homeownership and the share of households with mortgages. Mortgage debt increases by up to 20%. Household leverage and debt exposure measured as debt to income ratio increase slightly for households outside of MSAs.","The United States have experienced two major housing booms in the post WW2 period. During the first boom, between 1940 and 1960, the homeownership rate increased from 44 percent to 62 percent. After a long stable period, it started to rise again in the early 90s, from 64 percent in 1994 to 69 percent in 2004 (see ====). Although the role of policy-induced credit availability in the first boom is also substantial,==== the later boom benefited from a combination of homeownership promoting policy initiatives,==== changes in the structure of the mortgage market and ever increasing house prices. All these developments spurred on a dramatic increase in the availability of mortgage credit and relaxed lending standards which created a feedback cycle in house prices and in the likelihood of becoming a homeowner.==== The later part of this cycle in the early 2000s and the subsequent housing crash which triggered the Great Financial Crisis in 2008 have received vast attention. Discussions about the causes and the consequences of the so called “housing bubble” are still ongoing.====Homeownership rates in the United States hovered around 64 percent in the 1980s and in early 1990s. From 1994 it started to increase steadily and reached its peak in 2004 where it reversed course back to its pre-boom levels.==== This boom episode coincided with a major reform in the US banking system: The Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act (henceforth IBBEA) of 1994 enabled banks to operate across state boundaries. However, states retained rights to enforce/remove a list of barriers for interstate branch entries which allow us to exploit IBBEA as an exogenous shift in credit supply. We analyze the effect of deregulation-induced credit supply on household homeownership and mortgage decisions between 1996 and 2005 using micro data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). The panel nature of the SIPP allows us to condition on fixed individual characteristics, hence we estimate the effect of a change in credit supply on changes in households’ housing tenure and mortgage debt decisions.====We find that credit supply induced by interstate branching expansion increases the likelihood of being a homeowner and having a mortgage. This result is more prominent among individuals residing in metropolitan areas (MSAs) which seem to benefit from a surge in credit as documented in ====. Moreover, the effect is especially strong for young households, highlighting the life-cycle nature of the housing decision as pointed out in ====, ==== and ====. Low income households, on the other hand, do not seem to benefit from this credit expansion. The estimates suggest that a standard deviation change in deregulation (corresponding to a change by 1.4 index points) increases the probability of homeownership by 0.36 percentage points. The probability of having a mortgage increases by 0.70 percentage points. The implied effect of going from full to no regulation is an increase in the probability of homeownership by 1 percentage point and of having a mortgage by up to 2 percentage points. This suggests that not only do renters become homeowners due to this expansion of credit, but also outright homeowners take out loans on their houses. Our benchmark estimates are able to explain one fifth to one half of the aggregate rise in the homeownership rate and the share of mortgagors in the housing boom period.====We then show that the increases in the likelihood of being a homeowner and holding mortgage exclusively come from high income individuals (approximately 75% of individuals fall in this category). For young and low income individuals, who are more likely to have poor labor market prospects and no savings, the effect of deregulation is even negative in some specifications. More detailed analysis suggests that lower-middle income individuals have the highest increase in homeownership. These results resemble findings of ==== who studies the effect of the removal of ==== branching restrictions in the 1980s. Similarly, she finds that after the removal of these restrictions young and lower-middle income households’ homeownership likelihood increased.====Finally, we separately analyse individuals who already own a home and investigate the effect of credit supply on mortgage debt, home values, and leverage as measured by debt-to-value and debt-to-income as in ====, ====, and ====. We find that refinancing existing mortgages was only partially affected by this increase: only households that live outside of MSAs extended further mortgage debt. This suggests that deregulation-induced credit supply enabled individuals to access home-equity loans. On the other hand, in line with ====, we observe that low income individuals experienced an increase in debt-to-home value ratio. Finally, we find that the increase in debt-to-income ratio only appears in non-MSAs and the magnitude of the effect is not large.====The papers closest to ours are ====, ==== and ==== in that they use branching deregulation to investigate the effects of credit supply on housing markets and households’ investment and financial access decisions. However, our paper is distinct from these and the wider literature on finance and housing in the following ways. First, we use individual level panel data which substantially mitigates concerns with regards to selection of individuals into certain locations and its correlation with regulatory differences between states. While ==== and ==== also use individual-level data, they do not control for individual fixed effects. We argue in Section ==== that a within-person analysis of the effect of credit supply is meaningful and adds to the knowledge base in the literature. Note also that the focus of ==== is on access to finance while our interest is in housing related outcomes. Second, the individual level data enable us to analyze the effect of credit supply on different locations (MSAs vs. non-MSAs), demographics (young vs. old) and income groups (low income vs. high income). ==== considers similar demographics, but her analysis focuses on intra-state deregulation in the 1980s. The context of inter-state deregulation however is distinct in that both ownership rates as well as house prices increased much more in the 1990s than in the 1980s. Third, we quantify the contribution of deregulation triggered by IBBEA to the overall rise in homeownership and mortgagor shares. ==== conducts a similar exercise for the 1980s, and ==== quantify the impact of the IBBEA to house price changes. Furthermore, not uniquely but in contrast to the wider literature, our focus is on the evolution of ownership and mortgage credit in the earlier period of the housing boom rather than the period just before or around the start of the Great Recession in the late 2000s.==== and ==== use the same deregulation episode (IBBEA) and find that deregulation-induced credit supply increased for-purchase mortgage loan originations, house prices and financial access of low income households. Along similar lines, we observe an increase in homeownership and mortgage likelihoods in deregulated states. Moreover, we find that deregulation enhances access to home equity loans in non-MSAs and for low income households in MSAs. ==== uses the intrastate deregulation episode in the 1980s and investigates its consequences on household homeownership distribution. She finds that following the removal of intrastate branching restrictions mortgage lending increased by 5 percent and homeownership increased by 2 percent. This effect is particularly strong for young, black and lower-middle income households. Using the interstate branching expansion we find that very low income individuals do not become more likely to be homeowners or hold a mortgage, young individuals and lower-middle income groups take advantage of increased credit supply.====The US Housing boom and the subsequent bust in 2008 attracted a lot of attention to the role of credit supply on house prices and homeownership. The increase in credit supply has been attributed to a variety of policy measures such as the Community Reinvestment Act (====), pre-emption of anti-predatory-lending laws (====) and the Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act (====). We contribute to this literature using the latter policy as a measure of credit supply and investigate its effects on individual housing tenure and mortgage debt outcomes. While most of this literature focuses on the years 2000 and after, we believe that it is also important to account for the sharp rise in homeownership and mortgagor shares in the 1990s.====Our paper provides empirical insight into the theoretical discussion with regards to the role of borrowing vs. lending constraints in promoting housing tenure decision and household leverage in ==== and ====. Our policy instrument, interstate branching expansion, has been shown to increase local bank competition with higher branch density and lower interest rates (====, ====, ====). We point out that deregulation-induced competition and geographic diversification gains as argued by ==== could jointly contribute to the expansion of credit.==== We observe that low income households do not experience an increase in homeownership and for those households that do we do not find a sharp increase in leverage. These findings suggest that the effect of credit supply due to interstate branching would most likely work through a relaxation of lending constraints.====Our paper is further related to the literature that studies homeownership as a decision over the life-cycle. The theoretical models argue that housing demand is strongly related to a large menu of individual and aggregate factors such as marriage, earnings risk, local housing and rental price volatility and credit constraints (====, ====, ====, ====). The empirical literature demonstrates that changes in these conditions have more profound effects on young households as they mostly affect the timing of the homeownership decision (====, ====, ====). Our results suggest that the increase in credit supply due to interstate branching expansion strongly shifted housing and mortgage demand of young households.====Finally, our paper contributes to the discussion on the extent of rising mortgage debt along the income distribution. ==== argue that despite stagnant growth in earnings low-income neighborhoods experienced an uneven increase in mortgage debt in the early 2000s. ==== and ==== challenge this argument and claim that mortgage growth took place among all income groups. We show that although the deregulation episode does not yield an increase in housing demand for low income individuals in most of the cases, their leverage against home equity rises. Moreover, we also find a slight increase in households’ leverage as measured by debt-to-home value and debt-to-income ratios.====See ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====, ====.","Credit supply, homeownership and mortgage debt",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137723000347,Available online 2 June 2023,2023,Research Article,3.0

Using a unique dataset from the city of Brno, Czech Republic, we exploit housing reforms that followed the Velvet Revolution, and the subsequent fall of communism, as a source of exogenous assignment of homeownership. Across several estimation approaches, we do not find any evidence of homeownership hindering labor market activity. The estimated effects on labor force participation are around zero and our estimates for unemployment suggest that homeownership reduces it by four to six percentage points. Homeownership thus appears to benefit labor market performance.","Government policies tend to support homeownership via tax deductions, subsidies, privatization of public housing stock, and so on. This is controversial. On the one hand, some economists have suggested that homeownership is associated with positive externalities, making homeowners “better citizens” (DiPasquale and Glaeser, 1999, Huber and Montag, 2020). However, others have pointed out that homeownership is likely to increase mobility costs and may reduce labor market flexibility, leading to higher unemployment (Oswald, 1996). Whether subsidization of homeownership from taxpayer’s pockets is justified or whether homeownership should rather be discouraged thus depends on the way it affects the greater economic system. This paper focuses on the effects of homeownership on labor market activity, measured by labor force participation and unemployment.====This is not the first paper that has tried to address this question. However, the evidence gathered so far remains mixed: Aggregate-level studies have tended to find a positive correlation between unemployment and the share of owner-occupied housing, both within and across countries (e.g. Blanchflower and Oswald, 2013, Green and Hendershott, 2001, Oswald, 1996). Micro-data estimates, by contrast, have typically found that homeownership is associated with better labor market outcomes, mainly lower unemployment, its duration, and higher wages (see e.g. Battu et al., 2008, Coulson and Fisher, 2009, Munch et al., 2006). Additionally, while many studies have found homeowners to be less mobile than renters, recent evidence on the effects of property taxes suggests labor market-related mobility====is unaffected (Hilber and Lyytikäinen, 2017, Slemrod et al., 2017).====Since homeownership is not randomly assigned, identifying its true (causal) effects is challenging. In fact, the decision whether to become a homeowner is one of the most significant and consequential decisions people make in their lifetime. It is therefore likely to be influenced by various factors, including those related to individuals’ labor market performance and prospects. A number of strategies, with varying degrees of credibility, have been suggested to address this identification challenge. These include using instruments such as regional homeownership rates (DiPasquale and Glaeser, 1999), tax deductions and same-sex siblings (Coulson and Fisher, 2009), inheritance at a young age (Gardner et al., 2001), or exploiting changes and notches in property taxes (Hilber and Lyytikäinen, 2017, Slemrod et al., 2017). More recently, housing privatization has been proposed as an exogenous source of variation in homeownership (Broulíková et al., 2020, Huber and Montag, 2020, Sodini et al., 2021). This is where our paper is located.====The paper is closely related to two earlier papers studying the effects of housing privatization. Sodini et al. (2021) look at housing privatization within a sample of 46 buildings in Stockholm. They find that, among other things, homeownership increases labor mobility, while labor force participation and unemployment (measured by benefits take-up) are unaffected. Their policy experiment took place when ongoing privatization was stopped by a change in the central government’s policy. Thus some houses whose inhabitants voted for privatization were eventually deprived of becoming homeowners. One explanation of their results can thus be that jilted expectations chilled the motivation of these aspiring privatizers. Our results are generally consistent with theirs. In our context, however, there is no such shock to expectations and thus we can rule out this channel.====Broulíková et al. (2020) use individual-level cross-country survey data from 2010 to estimate the effects of housing privatization-induced homeownership on mobility (measured as a willingness to move) and unemployment, focusing on ten post-communist EU countries. They find null effects on both outcomes, although the point estimates with regard to unemployment are negative and substantively large. However, they only observe the privatization status of households who stayed in their privatized housing unit at the time of the survey, about ten years since the main privatization episodes occurred. To address the implied concerns about sample selection and unobserved heterogeneity driving their findings, they further employ individual-level panel data from Eastern Germany and estimate fixed effects regressions of labor market outcomes focusing on households that changed their status from renter to homeowner while remaining within the same housing unit (hence, likely privatizers). These estimates suggest a negative effect of homeownership on actual mobility and zero effects on unemployment and labor force participation.====In this paper, we use unique data on housing properties and their inhabitants from Brno, the second-largest city in the Czech Republic with a population of about 376,000 in 2001. This allows us to “zoom in” and focus on the effects of policy reforms under a fixed set of rules, in effect comparing direct neighbors. A shorter time between these policy shocks and our labor force data mitigates the sample selection concerns. A distinct feature of this paper is that we study two policy shocks affecting homeowner/renter status in the aftermath of the Velvet Revolution: ==== and ====.====Specifically, in the reforms that sprung after the fall of the communist regime in the Czech Republic, a significant portion of the hitherto public housing stock was privatized and restituted. Privatization resulted in tenants gaining ownership rights over the properties they inhabited. Restitution, by contrast, returned property ownership to the rightful owners, who had been expropriated by the communist regime after 1948. As a consequence, the tenants living in restituted properties became renters in properties owned by private landlords and they could not expect to privatize the housing unit they occupied.====Since these transfers of property rights could not have been foreseen when people moved in (i.e. typically before the fall of communism), housing privatization and restitution introduced an exogenous variation in homeowner/renter status. This can be nicely illustrated by Fig. 1, which depicts Čápkova street near the center of Brno. The apartments in the buildings on the left hand side were privatized, resulting in private homeownership by individual households, while those across the street were restituted and the tenants therein excluded from privatization, becoming tenants in privately owned properties. These policy shocks form the basis of our identification strategy (we provide more detail on the institutional background in Section 2).====We have collected a unique dataset on privatized and restituted properties in Brno and matched it with 1991 and 2001 census data. We believe this is the only individual-level dataset on restituted and privatized properties in the Czech Republic and are not aware of similar data from other transition countries. Apart from being data-driven, we note that focusing on one city is beneficial for our identification. Unlike in the cross-country setting studied by Broulíková et al. (2020), housing privatization in Brno was governed by a single set of rules. It also enables us to control for granular neighborhood, house-level, and individual characteristics. Additionally, the population, labor market, and housing conditions of one city are likely to be more homogeneous compared to broader populations studied in country-wide or cross-country studies, mitigating concerns related to unobserved heterogeneity. Finally, the city of Brno started to privatize its properties in 1998. This late start with privatization meant that there was less time in which the inhabitants might possibly change their tenure status between the privatization of their housing unit and the 2001 census, which we use to measure labor market activity.====We show that in 1991, i.e. before the reforms began, renters living in subsequently restituted properties were statistically similar to the tenants in properties that were not subject to restitution and thus remained in the public housing stock. Thus, restitution appears to have affected the households randomly. By contrast, housing privatization was managed by the municipalities themselves and in the case of Brno it appears to be non-random. For instance, individuals in properties that were later designated for privatization were significantly better educated than the people in the housing stock that remained public throughout the 2000s.====Empirically, we address the concerns pertaining to the selection of properties into privatization by matching privatized properties with restituted properties on pre-reform (1991) house-level characteristics. In addition, households in the properties designated for privatization were not obliged buy their unit (although, according to our data, over 91 percent of individuals living in privatized properties did privatize). We address the selection into privatization at the household level by instrumenting households’ homeownership status with the privatization status of the building in which their apartment is located.====Our results are easy to summarize: We do not find that homeownership causes higher unemployment. In fact, our preferred estimates for unemployment (IV regressions on matched sample) are consistently in between ==== and six percentage points for homeowners, relative to renters who exhibit ==== percent unemployment rate. Homeownership thus appears to decrease the risk of unemployment by about one third to one half. The estimated effects on labor force participation are always around zero. These results are robust to alternative specifications, estimation approaches, and do not depend on matching parameters.",Does homeownership hinder labor market activity?

Yet, it has attracted limited attention outside the Western world. In an online correspondence study based on 1,167 email applications to landlords at a major Chinese real estate website, we investigate whether there is unequal treatment in rental housing markets in the four ==== Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen. We find that applications with Uighur-sounding names are approximately seven percentage points less likely to receive a response from landlords and 9.6 percentage points less likely to be offered a showing compared to applications with Han Chinese names. Additional information on white-collar work or a long-term residence perspective in the city does not eliminate differences in landlords’ responses to names, therewith rejecting the idea of statistical discrimination on income or residence permits. We discuss possible extensions of the experimental design and conclude that the unequal treatment of different ethnic groups may pose an important future challenge to housing market regulation in urban China.","The integration of a diverse population has been a major challenge in many cities (Acolin et al., 2016). This is particularly the case for the Chinese cities with their large number of temporary labor migrants from multiple ethnic groups (Liu and Yu, 2020). China is a multi-ethnic country, where the various governments, at different levels, have been active in developing remote areas to integrate diverse populations. There are also various policies in place to integrate minorities who have migrated to remote cities. However, the debate of how to achieve such integration best is ongoing in China (Li et al., 2013; Xue and Li, 2020). Compared to migrants from the Han Chinese majority, migrants from ethnic minorities often are less likely to seek for long-term residence in the destination cities (Liu and Yu, 2020; Xie and Chen, 2018). Some studies propose that challenges, such as a strict residential mobility system and limited access to social security benefits, may be an obstacle to the integration or settlement intention of migrants from ethnic minorities (Li et al., 2013; Wang and Zuo, 1999). Yet, little is known about informal obstacles among market partners when Chinese migrants from minority ethnic groups move to a new city.====Market parties may treat migrants from ethnic minorities differently in economic exchange (Baldini and Federici, 2011). Unequal treatment of transaction partners is a common global phenomenon which widely occurs in labor markets, car markets, loan markets, academic markets, as well as housing markets (Bertrand and Duflo, 2017). Unequal treatment could be driven by gender (Neumark et al., 1996), weight (Katsaiti and Shamsuddin, 2016), illness (Devakumar et al., 2020), sexual orientation (Ahmed et al., 2008), as well as racial or ethnic features (Ewens et al., 2014). For example, in Chinese cities there are reports that people from ethnic minorities may suffer from unequal treatment in the housing market.==== Local residents may be reluctant to rent houses to people from ethnic minority groups due to security concerns, culture, or other reasons.====In this paper, we investigate whether migrants from minority ethnic groups are treated differently in major urban rental housing markets of China. We also test whether revealing migrants’ financial status or long-term residency perspectives have an impact on access to housing, which allows us to shed light on the mechanisms behind unequal treatment. In our empirical analysis, we focus on the different treatment of Uighur people and Han Chinese. Uighur people are one of the largest and fastest growing ethnic minority groups in China. An increasing number of Uighurs are migrating to large cities in pursuit of better lives. Uighurs’ income and literacy levels differ from the Han Chinese majority (Wu and Song, 2014) which could lead to a preferential treatment of one's own group. We contribute to a better understanding of ethnic integration in urban China, which has been a goal of Chinese governments for a long time.====This paper is novel in at least two important ways. First, we provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first experimental evidence on unequal treatment in Chinese rental housing markets. While there are a lot of studies on unequal treatment of migrants or minority groups in the rental housing markets in North America and Europe (see Acolin et al. (2016), Ahmed and Hammarstedt (2008), Beatty and Sommervoll (2012), Bosch et al. (2010) among others), much less is known on the different treatment of ethnic groups in rental housing markets in China. Second, Chinese rental housing markets are still dynamically developing. Regulation and measures against unequal treatment are rarely in place. Hence, our results may shed some light on the need for regulation of Chinese rental housing markets. Furthermore, our experimental design allows us to investigate mechanisms behind unequal treatment.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the relevant literature on unequal treatment in rental housing markets. Section 3 describes the design of the experiment.

Although the new lottery enrollment policy for private schools in China aims to promote equal and affordable education, it also introduces uncertainty. We assessed the policy impact using the panel data of residential housing transactions from the largest real estate agent in Chengdu during 2018–2020 and controlling for grid-level demographic and economic variables from mobile Internet data. We found that the lottery-based private school enrollment uncertainty leads to a substantial rise in the value of the key and elite school district house (SDH) prices. The house price premiums of the key SDH and elite SDH increased by 2.8% and 7.8% in the post-policy period, respectively. We also observed a significant intensification of residential sorting behavior within the elite public school districts afterwards. These results suggest that parents pay higher house prices when access to quality private schools becomes uncertain.","Unequal and expensive access to quality education has fueled social inequality globally (Abott et al., 2020; Zheng and Graham, 2022). Parents have gone to great lengths to provide quality schooling for their children, which drives the enormous capitalization effect of school quality on school district houses (SDH) in many countries (Tiebout, 1956; Oates, 1969; Bogart and Cromwell, 2000; Fack and Grenet, 2010; Dhar and Ross, 2012). In China, the nearby enrollment policy that assigns children of SDH owners to public primary schools is proximity-based, similar to that in the West. However, the quality public education supply shortage has driven the SDH premium higher than that in other countries (Zheng et al., 2016).====Economists and policymakers have gone a long way to promote affordable education and alleviate the problem of high-cost housing within quality public school zones. On the one hand, many public school choice plans have been outlined to increase neighborhood mobility or weaken the housing-schooling link, effectively addressing the problem of high SDH prices (DeLuca and Dayton, 2009; Brunner et al., 2012). On the other hand, private schools act as a powerful outside option when parents decide to buy an SDH. Previous studies find that private school voucher programs can decrease residential stratification by urging parents to move to less expensive communities and send their children to good private schools (Nechyba, 2003; Ferreyra, 2007). In addition, advantageous outside private school options such as increased availability and proximity can mitigate the impact of public school quality on house prices (Fack and Grenet, 2010; Sah et al., 2016).====Private schools in China have become a crucial supplementary supply force of public education since 1997 (Wang, 2010). They accounted for 34.76% of all schools nationwide in 2020. Instead of depositing a huge amount of money to buy SDH property near good public schools, parents have an alternative to access better education services regardless of the family property location. However, private schools are expensive, especially the elite ones. On November 11, 2019, the Chengdu Education Bureau (CEB) officially announced the implementation of a new lottery-based private school enrollment policy to curb the pre-selection high-fee spiral. The CEB makes it clear that private schools should use a random computerized admissions system if the number of applicants exceeds the enrollment plan starting from the 2020 school year. Private schools used to enjoy greater autonomy in the enrollment selection through high tuition fees, test scores, and interviews before the new policy. At the same time, public schools use residence registrations and family property addresses to determine children's admission to nearby schools. It dramatically decreases the certainty of attending elite private schools as selective admission is switched to a lottery system.====How would parents respond to uncertainty in the private school lottery enrollment program? Will anxious parents consider purchasing quality SDHs with guaranteed public school enrollment right? How would the policy impact, as reflected by the capitalization of secured school quality in the SDH value, change over time? This study estimates the policy impact on the pricing and trading behavior among SDHs of different qualities using panel data of residential housing transactions from the largest real estate agent in Chengdu during the period 2018–2020. We also include a set of mobile Internet data to control demographic and economic variables. We take Chengdu, a city with 21.2 million permanent resident population that ranks No. 4 in China, to conduct the study since private education originates and flourishes in this city and it is also the first city to implement the lottery enrollment policy. Moreover, Chengdu provides a cleaner setting to test the impact since there is a one-on-one pre-determined link between primary school enrollment rights and house property rights in this city. In contrast, several other megacities have adopted ""multi-school zoning"" programs for public schools before the lottery policy.====Our study has three main findings. First, our baseline results demonstrate that the capitalization of enrollment rights on housing prices is enormous, especially for that of quality schools. The price premium of SDHs with school enrollment access to key primary schools (key SDH) is 13.7% estimated by the Difference-in-Difference (DID) method, while that of more prestigious elite primary school access (elite SDH) is 37.1%. The results are similar to those estimated based on the spatially matched design, with location-based demographic and economic variables controlled at the grid level.====Second, the price premiums of key SDH and elite SDH increased significantly after the adoption of the lottery-based private school enrollment policy in 2019. The lottery policy further drives the housing price premiums of key SDH and elite SDH by 2.8% and 7.8%, respectively. The uncertainty of admission to private schools leads to a higher level of scarcity in elite SDH and incurs higher costs for parents securing better education services for their children. We also use a spatial matching strategy to identify the causal impact of the policy shock on quality SDH prices to deal with the possible omitted variable problems. Using mobile Internet data, we are able to include a set of grid-level control variables such as the population density and the average distance to the closest malls. The estimation results obtained using the spatially matched sample with controlled grid-level variables are similar to those obtained using the DID estimation. The results indicated that the lottery policy has strengthened residential sorting in quality SDHs, especially that of the elite schools. As the new lottery policy reduced the certainty of accessing freely chosen quality education services, parents became more willing to pay for secured good public school access.====Third, we confirm that the increased buying and sorting behaviors of anxious parents who cannot stand the lottery policy are pushing the quality SDH price premiums higher. The estimated coefficients demonstrate a significant increase in trading volume among quality SDH communities. In addition, the number of pre-trade tours of both key SDH and elite SDH communities has significantly increased after the lottery policy, while the average trade completion days in the post-policy period have greatly decreased. We observe an intensification of residential sorting behaviors in the elite school districts afterwards.====This paper first advances the understanding of SDH pricing premiums. Previous studies have quantified the school quality premium that capitalizes on the housing prices and its driving factors such as preference and demand issues (Tiebout, 1956; Oates, 1969; Fack and Grenet, 2010; Dhar and Ross, 2012; Zheng et al., 2016). In addition, previous studies found that advantageous and more affordable outside private school options, such as nearby and supportive private school voucher programs, can mitigate high SDH price problem (Nechyba, 2003; Ferreyra, 2007; Fack and Grenet, 2010; Sah et al., 2016). This paper evaluates the impact of a lottery-based private school enrollment program and find that adding uncertainty to the quality private education service supply force could increase the cost of education and exacerbate the education inequality problem. Second, this study contributes to the understanding of the price premium formation mechanism by analyzing the trading and residential sorting behavior in the post-policy period. We provide direct evidence of increased trading volume, increased pre-trade tours, and decreased transaction time to support that parents respond to the negative schooling shock with intensified quality SDH sorting behaviors.====We organize the rest of this paper as follows. Section 2 introduces the institutional background of SDH and policy shock on private schools in China. Section 3 describes the data sources, key variables, and summary statistics. Section 4 presents the main empirical results for the impact of the policy shock on quality SDH premiums and sorting behaviors.

In the K-12 public school system, educational quality varies across schools and districts, and at least by some measures traditionally disadvantaged student subgroups, such as racial minorities and the poor, are more likely to be enrolled in lower-quality schools (Reardon 2017).

America's K-12 education system often assigns students to schools based on residence, so a natural explanation is that it costs more, primarily in the form of housing costs, to live in a higher performing school zone.====Our paper contributes a holistic view of the housing cost barriers to school quality. First, as we will review, researchers have estimated the marginal willingness to pay for test score levels to be positive but small, and similar estimates for test score growth (i.e., rates of student learning) have been close to zero. While these measures, known as implicit prices, are a key component to housing cost barriers, we claim that the total barrier is likely much larger. Second, many researchers believe that school-wide test score growth rates are better measures of school quality than test score levels (Barnum 2017). Yet, as we will document, growth rates are relatively weakly associated with housing affordability. In contrast to the widespread concern, this observation suggests the possibility of only minor housing cost barriers to the pursuit of school quality.====We examine the association between school quality and housing affordability using comprehensive publicly-available national data. While previous work has examined housing costs barriers to test score growth for particular cities or states (Imberman and Lovenheim 2016), or nationally for test score levels (Rothwell 2012; Joint Economic Committee 2019), we examine these relationships nationally for both test score levels and growth rates. In addition, since a budget-constrained but education-quality-seeking family would gravitate towards low-cost housing units, conditional on a desired educational quality, we focus our analysis on the relationship between the share of affordable housing units and school quality measures.====In the process of considering housing costs as a barrier to school quality, we subdivide housing costs into four components, with supplementary analyses to shed light on their roles. This is to acknowledge that monthly costs alone (e.g., monthly rental rates or monthly mortgage payments) do not fully capture the extent of housing cost barriers to school quality. Indeed, for test score levels, we find that the tenure of the housing stock phases from renter- to owner-occupied as we move from low quality to high quality schools. Thus, average upfront costs, due to down payment requirements, rise as well. Our analysis shows that the housing cost barrier between very low performing schools and middle-performing schools is primarily driven by ==== costs due to the housing stock switching from renter-occupied to owner-occupied as school quality increases.====The organization of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we discuss our work in the context of related literatures in economics and sociology. Section 3 discusses several dimensions of housing cost as barriers to neighborhood choice. Section 4 describes the structure of our data and our empirical methods. We present our main findings in Section 5.

In Singapore, redevelopment of older multi-family properties requires the consent of majority owners to sell their units collectively in a process widely known as “====” sales. Using the resale transaction data in Singapore from 1995 to 2018, we find that private multi-family properties with redevelopment potentials sell at significant premiums of at least 36.7% on average. The resale values of properties with redevelopment potentials increase by 5.5% to 8.3% after the consent of the majority owners to sell the redevelopment rights is obtained. The anticipative effects are observed in resale transactions as early as one year before the ==== sale events. The price premiums increase from 8.4% to 13.64% when resale transactions occur in 7 to 12 months and within 6 months from the ==== event. The results are robust and orthogonal to supply constraints in the markets.","With the number of old buildings continuing to grow worldwide, it is crucial to correctly estimate the hedonic values associated with the redevelopment potentials of these older properties. According to the American Housing Survey 2017, more than half of the housing stocks in the US were built more than 40 years ago. These houses account for more than 70% of the housing stocks in more densely populated US cities, such as New York (77.3%), Boston (73.1%), and Los Angeles (71.4%) (Source: U.S. Census Bureau, American Housing Survey). In a separate report titled “People in the EU - statistics on housing conditions 2011”, the Eurostat (Census hub HC53) shows that more than two-third of the housing stocks in 28 European Union (EU) countries were built before 1980. Denmark (78.75%), the United Kingdom (77.49%), and Belgium (75.27%) are the three EU countries with the highest concentration of houses more than 40 years old.====Properties with large embedded redevelopment option values amplify bias in the regressions (Clapp and Salavei, 2010). If not accounted for, redevelopment option values result in omitted variable bias in hedonic regressions. It is harder to empirically measure redevelopment option values when hedonic attributes simultaneously determine property and redevelopment option values. This paper empirically tests the relationship between redevelopment options and property prices in a unique quasi-experiment using Singapore's large-scale redevelopment events. It disentangles redevelopment option values embedded in the hedonic values of residential properties.====Teardowns in US cities involve mostly single-family houses. In comparison, residential property redevelopments in Singapore involving mostly multi-family houses were carried out through a process known as ==== sales or collective sales. In an ==== sale of an apartment building, owners of strata units come together to sell redevelopment rights to a private developer. The developer will tear down the existing structure and build a new and higher-density property thereon. Therefore, property value is the sum of the use value of the existing building on the land and the redevelopment option value.====Using a large sample of property transaction data from January 1995 to August 2018, we sorted each transaction into either the successful ==== (treatment) group or the non-==== (control) group based on the ex-post ==== sale status. We then examine the effect of redevelopment potentials on property prices. In an efficient housing market, parties of an ==== sale (both individual owners and prospective developers) are aware of redevelopment option values embedded in properties. Price differences between two identical properties in the resale housing market, one with (treatment) and one without (control) ==== potential, represent the redevelopment potentials at time ====. The price differences are also known as en bloc, teardown, or redevelopment premiums. We include an “==== dummy in hedonic regressions to capture the redevelopment option premiums embedded in properties, ====.====Redevelopment option values estimated by the ==== dummy coefficient are endogenous if ==== events are not randomly determined. We employ the endogenous switching model with observable and unobservable characteristics of ==== properties to adjust the treatment selection process that jointly predicts the ==== probabilities and the resale prices. As robustness, we use the Propensity Score Matching (PSM) technique to find comparable properties in the control groups that closely match the sales in the treatment group and estimate ==== premium. The ==== premium estimated from the PSM-matched samples is lower due to close comparability between the two groups.====We summarize the three key empirical findings. First, we find significant redevelopment premiums embedded in resale prices of properties subsequently sold ==== (treatment). The endogenous switching model estimates the premiums at between 36.7% and 50.1%, controlling for the endogeneity in the ex-post ==== status. Second, we use the time to set up Collective Sale Committee (CSC), a committee representing property owners in an ==== sale process, as the treatment shock because it signals owners’ intent to sell properties ====. We find that the ==== premium increased significantly by 5.5% to 8.3% after the treatment shock.====We use the new Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty (ABSD) policy as an additional shock in our difference-in-differences (DID) model. The ABSD imposes a penalty on developers for ==== properties acquired after 2011 if they fail to complete and sell all the units in a project within 5 years from the date of acquisition (Diao et al., 2021). We find that the ABSD shock causes significant negative treatment effects on resale prices of ==== targets launched after 2011 relative to non-==== properties. Third, we show that redevelopment option values are time-varying that increase with redevelopment probability. More specifically, we find that redevelopment option value increases non-linearly when the actual ==== sale event approaches.====The paper contributes to two strands of literature. The first contribution is related to the teardown and redevelopment options literature (Brueckner, 1980; Clapp and Salavei, 2010; Dye and McMillen, 2007; Gedal and Ellen, 2018; McMillen and O'Sullivan, 2013; Munneke, 1996; Munneke and Womack, 2015; Rosenthal and Helsley, 1994; Weber et al., 2006; Wheaton, 1982). The second contribution is related to the holdout and assembly literature (Brooks and Lutz, 2016; Cadigan et al., 2011; Kominers and Weyl, 2012; Tanaka, 2007). Our empirical results show significant redevelopment option premiums in resale prices of multi-family properties. In these properties, individual apartment owners collectively sell redevelopment rights of the properties to developers. Redevelopment option values change with the perceived redevelopment probability of properties. In addition to property age and permissible development intensity, we find that larger developments with more apartment units tend to have a lower redevelopment probability. We could not rule out holdout problems in these large ==== sales.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

Despite first regulatory efforts by municipalities, the impact on rents and house prices has been examined insufficiently in scientific literature, especially with regards to Europe. Therefore, this paper addresses this gap by analyzing data on ==== listings for 25 European cities between 2010 and 2019. Using fixed effects and dynamic panel regressions, we show that home-sharing has significantly contributed to a rise in rents and house prices in European cities. While these effects are mainly concentrated in city centers, we also document effects in other urban districts. Finally, recent home-sharing regulations are not associated significantly with housing affordability.","The increasing unaffordability of housing has become a major challenge for cities all over the world. While homeowners and investors benefit from growing housing prices, a rising number of people are forced to spend an increasing share of their income on housing (Wetzstein, 2017). In Europe, the House Price Index has experienced rapid growth in recent years. For this reason, housing affordability has become a burning issue. In 2017, 10.4% of EU28 households experienced housing cost overburdens (housing costs that exceed 40% of disposable income). When taking tenants into account, and leaving property owners aside, the share is even higher with 26.4% (Eurostat, 2019). As possible side effects, declining housing affordability bears dramatic implications like cuts in personal health services, education, and wellbeing (Clair et al., 2016; Wetzstein, 2017), weaker economic performance and growth (Johnes and Hyclak, 1999), as well as urban conflict and crime (Glaeser et al., 2009).====The recent debate, especially in North America and Europe, more and more often draws a connection between housing affordability and the disrupting effects of the sharing economy (Booth, 2015; O’Sullivan, 2018). In particular, home-sharing platforms such as ==== are often accused of exacerbating the housing affordability crisis by causing a shift from long-term to short-term renting. In this context, protest movements against home-sharing platforms arose in numerous cities. On the other hand, supporters argue that home-sharing provides residents with an additional source of income, which helps residents get along in a tight housing market (Horn and Merante, 2017; Segu, 2018). ==== itself recently promoted a report along those lines, arguing that ==== helps middle-class households combat income stagnation (Sperling, 2015).====Given the severity of the housing crisis in many cities along with rising resentment and the heated debate around home-sharing platforms, it appears necessary to examine the relationship between home-sharing and the housing crisis further. This necessity is underlined considering the global scope of home-sharing – ==== alone boasts approximately 7 million lodging options in 100,000 cities (Airbnb, 2019). In light of the enormous expected growth of home-sharing platforms (Yaraghi and Ravi, 2017), this seems even more important because the possible effects on rents and house prices are likely to be exacerbated and spread around the globe. ==== is the most prominent player in this sector, for which listing data is available in contrast to other home sharing platforms such as ==== or ====. Thus, we concentrate on ==== in the subsequent analysis. Further, focusing on one platform avoids an estimation bias due to properties being listed on multiple platforms.====Despite this relevance and topicality, the scientific literature on the impact of home-sharing on house prices and rents is insufficient. Although there is a growing branch of literature, the vast majority is purely descriptive and thus fails to identify causal relationships. Additionally, the studies that go beyond a descriptive analysis mainly focus on the USA or consider very limited regional areas (mainly single cities). In particular, the effects in Europe, which is considered to be a vast and growing home-sharing market (Yong and Tan, 2019), have only been examined insufficiently.====This paper intends to address this research gap by analyzing the effect of ==== listings on residential rents and housing prices in 25 European cities, differentiating also between their centers and other urban districts. Additionally, this study also extends the temporal horizon by analyzing a period of ten years in total (2010–2019). Therefore, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze the impact of ==== on housing prices and rents for such a broad range of cities across Europe.====Our results show that home-sharing has significantly contributed to a rise in rents and housing prices in European cities. While these effects are mainly concentrated in city centers, we also document effects in other districts. While several cities adopted home-sharing regulations, we could not document any significant correlations of such regulations with housing affordability.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the previous literature and presents the theoretical basis. In Section 3 the data set used for the analyses is introduced. Subsequently, the econometric strategy and empirical results are presented and interpreted in Section 4.

The simple mechanical effect is the effect that would occur in the absence of any behavioral responses aside from those in the experiments. The estimates of the simple mechanical effects overlap the confidence intervals in Corinth's (2017) regression study of the total effect. This finding suggests that the net effect of behavioral responses outside the experiments is small. The essay illustrates how useful inferences about aggregate-level phenomena can be derived from individual-level data.====I am grateful to Emmy Tiderington and Yi-Ping Tseng for helpful comments and information, and to an anonymous referee.","Strategies that work on an individual level do not always work the same way on an aggregate level. Running your air conditioner on high all summer may be a good way to keep yourself cool in the era of climate change, but it will not keep the planet cool (given today's electricity generating technology). Stockpiling groceries and toilet paper at the start of a pandemic may be a wise precaution for a household to take, but if everyone runs to the supermarket to stockpile, the pandemic may spread faster and the rise in demand may create a shortage that would not otherwise have existed; stockpiling may create and exacerbate the problems it was trying to avoid.====Similarly, interventions that produce promising results on an individual basis do not translate automatically into policies that reproduce the same results on an aggregate level. Translation is difficult and uncertain. This essay is about an example of such translation. It shows how translation can be done, what its uncertainties are, and how it can be valuable.====The effects of permanent supportive housing in general and (Pathways) Housing First==== in particular are areas where the implications of individual level patterns on aggregate level outcomes have not always been clear, and have sometimes been stated incorrectly. Several high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that permanent supportive housing and Housing First cause improvements in many housing outcomes for their participants (see reviews in, for instance, Kertesz and Johnson, 2017, Miler et al., 2021), but these are individual-level results. Aggregate-level results would require RCTs that randomly assigned permanent supportive housing (PSH) and Housing First (HF) beds to different cities, or natural experiments where such beds were assigned as if randomly. So far, no such RCT has been reported, and only one viable natural experiment has been studied (Corinth 2017).====Why would experiments—natural or otherwise—be needed to estimate the effect of interventions on PIT homelessness rigorously? Because RCTs with individuals look at only a small piece of the possible consequences of setting up and operating a Housing First program—the effect of treatment (or intent to treat) on the treated. They don't tell us, for instance, whether the availability of Housing First causes counselors to press a little harder to get people to go live with their families or in unsubsidized earlier in their homeless spells. They don't tell us whether homeless people would act that way on their own. And they don't tell us how the housing market reacts to the intervention—perhaps the whole process is a game of musical chairs, with an apartment for one person keeping someone else from being housed.====Hence how much (if at all) permanent supportive housing or Housing First reduce aggregate homelessness is not well known at this point. But some of the RCTs have data that allow us to make some inferences about the size of the effects they might have. These RCTs allow us to estimate what I will call the “simple mechanical effect” of these interventions on point-in-time (PIT) counts of homelessness (in this case, homelessness according to the U.S. definition). The simple mechanical effect means the effect the intervention would have if the only behavioral responses were those that the RCT studied. The simple mechanical effect is neither an upper bound nor a lower bound on the complete effect: the behavioral response outside the RCT might reduce homelessness (contagion effects, for instance) or raise it (incentives to remain homeless, for instance). Instead, the simple mechanical effect is a starting point for analysis if the net outside-RCT behavioral effects are large, or an approximation to the complete effect if the outside-RCT behavioral effects are small.",Aggregate-level inferences from individual-level data: The case of permanent supportive housing and housing first,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137722000857,10 January 2023,2023,Research Article,10.0

The 2008 financial crisis highlighted the need for a standardized loss mitigation toolkit, which was initially developed during the financial crisis and improved as the government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) were forced to deal with the effects of several natural disasters. The 2008 financial crisis also highlighted the need for policymakers to move quickly.====Both these lessons were taken to heart and applied to the COVID-19 pandemic. In March 2020, just after the virus hit, the US, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the GSEs announced that their more flexible forbearance and modification policies that apply to natural disasters would apply during the pandemic. These programs allowed mortgage borrowers to pause their mortgage payments for a specified period with minimal documentation. This was codified for all federal mortgages in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which became law less than two weeks later. Although mortgage servicers without a federal guarantee or insurance are not required to offer similar relief on these mortgages, many choose to do so.====The pandemic forbearance policy was the first large-scale application of forbearance. Several studies have documented the pandemic's effects on mortgage borrowers and shown the positive impacts of forbearance. ==== show that Black and Hispanic households have been far more affected by COVID-19 than have white households, and low-income communities have been more affected than high-income communities. ==== show the pandemic has exacerbated the inequalities between low-income borrowers and high-income borrowers and between Black and Hispanic borrowers and their white counterparts. The forbearance program mitigated inequalities, as Black and Hispanic borrowers took up forbearance at higher rates.====In this paper, we examine the impact of forbearance on two groups of mortgage borrowers: single borrowers and coborrowers. Using 2021 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data, we show that these two groups have different characteristics; single borrowers have lower incomes, lower property values, and smaller loans. Moreover, single borrowers are more likely to be Black or Hispanic and slightly younger.====Detailed loan-level GSE data show that single borrowers have weaker credit profiles than coborrowers, indicated by lower FICO scores, higher loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, and higher debt-to-income (DTI) ratios. These stylized facts are documented by previous studies (====; ====). ==== show that the default rate for single borrowers increases during economic downturns, as a higher incidence of unemployment during economic downturns makes single borrowers more susceptible to default.====We looked at the likelihood of forbearance program take-up for single borrowers and coborrowers. We found that single borrowers are more apt to request forbearance than coborrowers, holding other characteristics constant. Given that single borrowers are more likely to be more vulnerable to income loss as a result of job loss during periods of economic stress, our results are consistent with both the double-trigger theory (====) and the life events theory of mortgage default (====). This would suggest single borrowers are more motivated to participate in forbearance.====More importantly, this paper examines the post forbearance performance of single borrowers versus coborrowers. We show that when single borrowers elect forbearance, they are more likely to avoid delinquency entirely or recover and exit delinquency. In other words, forbearance is more effective in mitigating default for single borrowers.====To our knowledge, our paper is the first to look at how forbearance has served single borrowers versus coborrowers during the pandemic and contributes to the pandemic literature, such as work by ====, ====, and ====. It also contributes to the literature on forbearance take-up, which includes work from ====, ====, and ====.====Moreover, our paper examines the importance of forbearance in helping mortgage borrowers avoid or recover and exit delinquency.

We find that young households and first-time home buyers account for much of the increase in housing demand during the pandemic, but they are largely crowded out of the housing market by the equilibrium rise in house prices."," But house prices increased by around 10 percent in real terms in 2020, and rose by 15 percent in the year to July 2021 (see ==== Household activities and consumption patterns also changed dramatically. In particular, households spent much more of their time and money at home. In this paper, we argue that the greater utilization of housing was associated with a significant increase in the demand for and valuation of houses. In particular, we study the extent to which stay-at-home shocks explain the rise in house prices during the pandemic.====Our paper presents both empirical evidence and quantitative modeling analysis that show that the shift towards at-home activity was associated with a significant increase in house prices. First, we document large and persistent shifts towards household time spent at home and expenditures on at-home consumption during the pandemic. We then provide cross-sectional evidence that counties with larger increases in time spent at home also experienced faster house price growth. Second, we build a heterogeneous agent model with ==== in housing markets to study the quantitative importance of stay-at-home shocks during the pandemic. In the model, households consume goods away-from-home, goods at-home, and housing services. We model a stay-at-home shock as a change in consumption preferences that is consistent with the observed shift towards at-home consumption during the pandemic. Since at-home goods and housing services are consumed together, the shock also raises the demand for housing and increases house prices in equilibrium. In a series of dynamic pandemic experiments, we find that stay-at-home shocks account for nearly half of the overall rise in house prices during 2020.====We begin by studying changes in consumption patterns and time-use during the pandemic. Using household-level micro-data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX), we show that at-home consumption expenditure rose significantly in 2020. The share of food expenditure on food consumed at home rose from around 65 percent to around 70 percent during 2020. We construct a measure of non-durable goods and services consumption, and we show that the away-from-home share of non-durables fell by 4 percent, while the at-home consumption and housing services shares rose by around 2 percent each.==== These changes in consumption patterns are also reflected in changes in the time that households spent at home and away from home. Drawing on measures of household mobility from Google Mobility Reports, we show that households spent around 10 percent more time at home on average during the pandemic in 2020.====We then provide cross-sectional regression evidence that more time spent at home is associated with greater housing demand. Using monthly county-level data from 2020, we regress real house price growth on time spent at home as well as the number of visits to retail and recreational locations. In addition to controlling for a range of potentially confounding factors, we also make use of a plausibly exogenous instrument for changes in household mobility. We construct a shift-share instrument by combining the county-level share of jobs that can be performed at home (====) with state-level measures of pandemic intensity (====). Both our OLS and 2SLS results suggest a strong positive relationship between household mobility and house price growth during the pandemic.====Next, we build a structural model of the housing market to rationalize our empirical evidence and quantitatively assess the overall contribution of stay-at-home and other macroeconomic shocks to house price growth during the pandemic. Our model features heterogeneous households that consume goods away from home, goods at home, as well as housing services. We assume that at-home goods and housing services are consumed as part of a home bundle, while away-from-home goods are imperfect substitutes for this bundle. We model stay-at-home shocks during the pandemic as a shift in preferences towards consumption of the home bundle, which in-turn causes an increase in demand for both at-home goods consumption as well housing services.====We model the pandemic as a collection of four shocks that hit the economy in 2020 and 2021 and study the dynamics of housing demand over this period. In addition to the preference shocks that induce households to consume more at home, we include a negative shock to mortgage ====, a spike in unemployment, and large fiscal transfers in the form of stimulus checks and expanded unemployment benefits. Our calibrated pandemic shocks are sufficient for our model to match the excess rate of house price growth observed in 2020. We use the model to decompose the increase in house prices into contributions from each of the shocks, and to shed light on the underlying sources of the rise in housing demand. The model suggests that stay-at-home shocks to preferences explain nearly half of the overall increase in house prices in 2020. Declining mortgage interest rates explain a little over a third of the house price increase, while unemployment shocks and fiscal stimulus have relatively small effects on house prices. We show that much of the increase in housing demand is driven by first-time home buyers, with some additional effect due to more existing homeowners upsizing and fewer existing homeowners downsizing. Finally, our model suggests that most of the underlying increase in housing demand comes from young households that would like to become homeowners. However, the general equilibrium rise in house prices crowds out many of these would-be buyers, which results in an overall decline in homeownership rates for the young during the pandemic.

By web-scraping them for the UK on a daily basis, this paper extracts a large database from which we build timely and highly granular indicators. One originality of the dataset is to focus on the supply side of the housing market, allowing to compute innovative indicators reflecting the sellers' perspective such as the number of new listings posted or how prices fluctuate over time for existing listings. Matching listing prices in our dataset with transacted prices from the notarial database, using machine learning, also measures the negotiation margin of buyers. During the Covid-19 crisis, these indicators demonstrate the freezing of the market and the “wait-and-see” behaviour of sellers. They also show that listing prices after the lockdown experienced a continued decline in London but increased in other regions.","Against this background, the purpose of this paper is to exploit such publicly available information online to build real-time and granular indicators for the housing market. Our approach builds on web-scraping the five main real-estate websites in the UK: ====, ====, and ==== – plus ==== and ==== which focus on Northern Ireland and Scotland respectively. On average, we scrape around 1.5 million listings per day with extensive information on price, type of ads (for sale or to rent), location, area, number of rooms, type of good, and general description. Taking advantage of this innovative dataset, we build real-time indicators for the supply side of the housing market that can complement the official statistics.====The originality of the web-scraped data lies in getting the supply side of the housing market through the listings that sellers (or the real-estate agencies they mandate) post on the Internet. This peculiar point of view – in the literature – brings a twofold value-added. It first allows monitoring the housing market in real-time, notably price trends in listings that can be tracked daily and at a highly granular level. While not a substitute for transacted data – which reflect the outcome of the housing market equilibrium – such information centred on the supply side of the market can provide complementary, as well as timely and granular, information. In addition, this original dataset also allows for innovative indicators as regards sellers’ perspective. A first example is the number of new listings – indicating sellers’ willingness to put their properties on the market. A second one relates to price changes for an existing listing as our daily web-scraping makes it possible to track one listing over time and observe how its price adjusts. In a second endeavour, our dataset makes it possible to match listings with transactions. Discrepancies appear – showing frictions between buyers and sellers in reaching market equilibrium, reflected by transactions – and the difference between the two provides an indication on the negotiation margin of buyers.====Using these indicators in a conjectural fashion, we track the UK housing market during the Covid-19 crisis. Our supply-side indicators show a clear 80% decline in the number of new listings during the first lockdown and also shows that during the lockdown, sellers refrained from changing their prices, suggesting that most adopted a ""wait-and-see"" approach. In the aftermath of the lockdown, average listing prices started to increase at country-level. However, this has hidden large discrepancies across regions: while listing prices increased steadily in rural areas, they declined in London – the region most affected by the virus and where evidence suggests that the housing market is the tenser. Such cross-region heterogeneities are further documented in our computation of the buyers’ negotiation margin.====This paper contributes to the literature, first by providing new evidence for the ongoing move to higher frequency statistics relying to some extent on alternative data (see ====). Rather than competing with official statistics, our web-scraped data complement the latter by detecting trends with enhanced timeliness (daily indices in real-time vs. monthly / quarterly with lag) and high granularity (ZIP code level vs. region-level at best). In a broader perspective, this paper mirrors the recent endeavour across economists to design high-frequency indicators (e.g. ====) – which the Covid-19 has made more pressing. More specifically, we contribute to the literature using alternative data to monitor the real-estate market, such as ==== with Google Trends. Closer to us, we expand a recent strand of the literature making use of web-scraping to analyse the housing market (e.g. ====). In this strand of the literature, this paper is close to ==== by relying on web-scraping to derive indicators of the supply side of the housing market. Finally, this paper stands out by focusing on the UK market in this Covid-19 / Brexit period – though the approach can be seamlessly expanded in other geographies.====The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. ==== reviews the related literature, ==== describes how we retrieve and clean the data, ==== presents the real-time monitoring of the housing market during the Covid-19 crisis. ==== explores alternative indicators, namely a measure of buyers’ negotiation power as well as the rent-to-price ratio.

This paper characterizes the geographic distribution of the tax expenditures from these tax preferences using a new method that exploits household-level microdata from the 2019 Census Public Use Microdata Sample to simulate homeownership tax expenditures at the Public Use Microdata Area level. I estimate that in the 2018 tax year, $226.05 billion in taxable revenue was lost to the mortgage interest deduction ($28.20 billion), the property tax deduction ($9.51 billion), the exclusion of net imputed rental income ($134.82 billion), and the partial exclusion of housing-related capital gains ($53.52 billion). Large metropolitan areas and neighborhoods with high housing prices receive subsidies in excess of the cost of funding homeowner tax preferences, while the burden of homeowner tax preferences falls heavily on rural areas. If federal income tax law reverted to what existed just prior to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, these geographic disparities would be exacerbated.","It pays to be a homeowner, particularly in the United States where homeowners receive income tax deductions for mortgage interest payments and state and local property taxes and pay no income tax on their home's imputed rental income and a large share of housing-related capital gains. The Treasury Department Office of Tax Analysis (OTA) estimates that in fiscal year 2019, the federal government awarded $199 billion to homeowners through the mortgage interest deduction ($27 billion), state and local property tax deduction ($6 billion), partial exclusion of capital gains tax on home sales ($44 billion), and the exclusion of imputed rental income ($121 billion). The exclusion of imputed rental income is the second largest tax expenditure item reported by the OTA, falling behind only the exclusion of employer contributions for medical insurance premiums and medical care ($203 billion) (Office of Tax Analysis, 2018). When the four homeownership tax expenditures are added together, they are the largest source of foregone income tax revenue.====In this paper, I examine the spatial distribution of each of these four homeownership tax expenditures and explore changes in the spatial pattern of tax expenditures under a counterfactual tax regime with smaller restrictions on the size of certain allowable housing-related income tax deductions and exclusions. Although many have studied the economic effects of the differential tax treatment of homeownership in the US (see, for example, Hanson 2012, 2014, Dantas and Hembre 2021, Martin and Hanson 2016, Sommer and Sullivan 2018), less is known about the geographic distribution of homeownership income tax expenditures. Keightley (2017) and Brady et al. (2003) examine the spatial distribution of homeownership tax expenditures across states but do not drill down below the state level and ignore one or more of the four major types of homeownership tax expenditures.====The best evidence to date on the geography of homeownership tax expenditures for small geographic areas comes from a series of papers by Gyourko and Sinai (2001, 2003) and Sinai and Gyourko (2004). Gyourko and Sinai (GS, henceforth) rely on aggregate census tract-level data from the US Census of Population and Housing to estimate the number of households by income and household type and the joint distribution of housing prices and income. These weighted estimates are then entered into the TAXSIM microsimulation model developed by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) to produce estimated tax liabilities under different assumptions about the taxation of housing-related income. This approach allows the authors to characterize the geography of homeownership tax expenditures for small areas of geography.====While useful, the GS approach has important limitations. Certain census tract totals, such as the number of dependents by marital status and income quartile, are not provided in publicly available census tract-level data or are only provided as categorical frequency distributions. GS estimate the joint distribution of housing price and income by assigning households in each decile of the income distribution the value corresponding to the same decile of the housing value distribution. This procedure is only valid under the strong assumption of perfect residential sorting of households by ranked income and housing price categories. Finally, GS are unable to estimate the effect of differences in tax rates for different sources of income and ignore housing-related tax expenditures due to the partial exclusion of capital gains tax. Although most of these limitations can be circumvented by using microdata rather than aggregate census tract-level data to simulate income tax liabilities, few have relied on Census microdata to examine the geographic distribution of homeownership tax expenditures. Albouy (2009) and Albouy and Hanson (2014) rely on the Census Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) to estimate the locational inefficiencies associated with homeownership tax deductions, but these authors do not fully characterize the spatial distribution of each type of homeownership tax expenditure.====Few studies have examined the geographic distribution of homeownership tax expenditures since the enactment of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). The 2017 TCJA changed tax law in several ways that shaped the differential tax treatment of homeownership. First, TCJA changed marginal tax rates and tax brackets, reducing marginal tax rates for most households and the marginal value of housing-related deductions for those who choose to itemize deductions. Second, the TCJA roughly doubled the standard deduction from $6,350 for singles and $12,700 for married couplies to $12,000 for singles and $24,000 for married couples, making the itemization of housing-related deductions less worthwhile for the average household. Third, TCJA lowered the total allowable mortgage debt against which interest deductions can be claimed from $1 million to $750,000. Fourth, the TCJA capped the state and local property tax deduction at $10,000. Finally, although the TCJA did not change the threshold of housing-related capital gains subject to a tax, it did change the tax structure for capital gains. Most qualifying housing-related capital gains are taxed as long-term capital gains. Although TCJA did not change tax rates on long-term capital gains, it changed the tax brackets for long-term capital gains and decoupled them from the tax brackets for ordinary income. The net impact of this change depends on the tax rates and brackets a household would have faced pre-TCJA compared to post-TCJA.====Each of the tax law changes introduced by the TCJA likely altered the magnitude and spatial distribution of homeownership tax expenditures. A few studies have relied on microdata to investigate the impacts of the TCJA on home prices (Li and Yu, 2020; Davis, 2019), homeownership rates, and mortgage interest rates (Hembre and Dantas, 2021). Ambrose et al., (2022) rely on data from the American Housing Survey to examine differences in the impact of the TCJA between high housing price metropolitan areas and low housing price metropolitan areas, but no papers have examined the impact of the TCJA on spatial inequality in homeownership tax expenditures across small geographic areas.====This paper provides recent estimates of the geographic distribution of homeownership tax expenditures using a new method that exploits household-level microdata from the 2019 Census PUMS to simulate homeownership tax expenditures at the Census Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) level. I employ TAXSIM, using 2019 PUMS data as inputs, to simulate homeownership tax expenditures for all US homeowners. The results from the simulation are aggregated to the PUMA level to yield small-area estimates of the income tax revenue forgone to each type of homeownership tax expenditure with and without the 2017 TCJA tax law changes. In contrast to previous studies, the method employed in this paper allows for a detailed examination of between-PUMA spatial inequality, across all tax expenditure categories, while controlling for differences in the household-level determinants of tax liabilities.====I estimate that in the 2018 tax year, $226.05 billion in taxable revenue was lost to the mortgage interest deduction ($28.20 billion), the property tax deduction ($9.51 billion), the exclusion of net imputed rental income ($134.82 billion), and the partial exclusion of housing-related capital gains ($53.52 billion). The residents of large metropolitan areas receive subsidies in excess of the cost of funding homeowner tax preferences, while rural residents incur costs in excess of the tax benefits received. Homeownership tax expenditures are highest in the West and in PUMAs with high housing prices and few Black residents. If federal income tax law reverted to what existed just prior to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, spatial inequality in homeownership tax expenditures would be exacerbated. It should be emphasized that the analysis does not consider the possible housing market impacts of changes in tax law. Thus, the findings should be interpreted as an accounting exercise that ignores behavioral responses.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. I begin with a discussion of housing user costs with differential tax treatment and then describe the data and methods used in this paper to estimate the geographic distribution of homeownership tax expenditures. In the discussion of research findings, I examine aggregate estimates for the nation as a whole and compare these estimates to those prepared from other sources. I then consider the spatial distribution of each type of homeownership tax expenditure, explore spatial patterns of income tax redistribution, examine the household-level and geographic correlates of homeownership tax expenditures, and examine the distributional impacts of the TCJA. I conclude with a discussion of the implications of the findings.",The geography of US homeownership tax expenditures,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137722000602,30 November 2022,2022,Research Article,15.0

We find multiple forms of discrimination against African-American tenants, including less responses, responses with less greeting and polite words being used, and levels of discrimination that progressively increases along measures of school quality and neighborhood characteristics. In contrast, we find substantially less evidence of discrimination against voucher holders. Voucher holders do not see lower rates of response, though responses arrive later on average and they face lower rates of responses in neighborhoods with very high quality schools. The results demonstrate that racial discrimination is substantial even in a context where landlords advertise to low-income families, though discrimination against voucher holders may be attenuated.","The US Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) Housing Choice Voucher program delivers assistance to very low-income families, the elderly, and other high-need groups to rent safe and sanitary housing in the private market. Often known as Section 8, the program spent $25 billion in 2021 and assisted over five million households to afford housing, with many more on waiting lists. Nearly half of assisted families are from underrepresented minority and special needs groups.====The Fair Housing Act, included in the Civil Rights Act of 1968, made it unlawful to discriminate based on race, color, religion, gender, or national origin in housing negotiations. Despite the law, evidence shows that substantial housing discrimination exists against both minorities (Carpusor and Loges, 2006, Hanson and Hawley, 2011, Ewens et al., 2014, Hanson and Santas, 2014) and voucher holding families (Phillips, 2017, Moore, 2017), underscoring the importance of assessing and limiting housing discrimination to support the effectiveness of the voucher program.====This paper uses a correspondence experiment to study housing discrimination in a low-income context. We design an experiment to randomize the race and voucher status of fictional tenants and send inquiries to landlords who advertise ==== to low-income families. Inquiries were sent with names that signal the tenant’s race, along with cues on voucher status, via the communications module of a web site dedicated to posting available low-income units. Our team captured email, text message, and phone call responses from landlords, the amount of hours until each response, and recorded the transcript of the responses. We then examine the effects of race and voucher status on the likelihood of receiving a response, the length of time a response is received, and the choice of words used in responses.====We further contribute empirically in two ways. First, we study available units from a wider variety of geographic locations than past studies, which include Carpusor and Loges (2006), Ewens et al. (2014), Hanson and Hawley (2011), and Phillips (2017). Unit characteristics, neighborhood quality, and school quality vary greatly in our data. The variation allows us to examine heterogeneity in effects and to discuss marginal effects relative to average effects. Second, we collect data on both the timing and text of messages sent in the landlords’ responses, which allows us to analyze the choice of words and to discuss sentiment towards different groups. Hanson et al. (2011) was the first to show that African-American tenants are less likely to see formal greetings and polite language in landlord responses, which shows the potential of ‘subtle discrimination’ beyond the presence of a response.====We find that racial discrimination exists despite the low-income context. Inquiries sent by African-American tenants receive 17% less responses than White tenants. African-Americans also receive responses that are 17.5% less likely to include a greeting and 13.5% less likely to include the word “please”. Merging unit characteristics data with school quality and neighborhood characteristics, we find suggestive evidence that African-Americans face progressively more discrimination as school quality increases and as the percentage of black residents decreases.====Though we find no evidence that overt discrimination exists against voucher holders, we find that voucher holders wait 14.5 h ==== for a response on average. This is about 30% longer than the control group. We also find that voucher holders face discrimination in neighborhoods with very high-quality schools and neighborhoods with the lowest percentage of black residents.====Beyond the findings pertaining to discrimination, this paper add contextual color to the empirical literature. We view the population of interest as a major contribution to the literature. We focus on properties being advertised to low-income families on a website where families often search for voucher-accepting rental properties. Given that these self-selected landlords may be more open to low-income families inhabiting their properties than the general population, we hypothesize that racial and voucher discrimination should be attenuated or negligible for this population. Yet our study concludes that ==== discrimination, and to a much lesser extent ==== discrimination, exists even in a context where landlords advertise to low-income families. Also, whereas much of the previous literature focus on Craigslist as the platform of choice, we find that the quantity and nature of the responses we collected on our platform of choice – GoSection8 – are different from past studies. For example, our response rates are closer to 20% compared to many studies where response rates may often reach 50%. We hope to encourage researchers to focus on emerging technologies in the online housing market and to estimate discrimination in various contexts and platforms.====This paper is laid out as follows: We start with a literature review and position our contributions in Section 2. We describe the background and context, including our platform of choice, in Section 3.

One of the advantages of this procedure is that it should be straightforward for assessors and public finance officials to use and understand and easy to explain to residents (Bidanset et al. 2022).====The procedure for choosing comparables is based on the Mahalanobis distance measure.==== That is, the comparables are the subset of transacted properties with the smallest values of a metric based on the weighted absolute difference of specified structural characteristics between the comparables and the target property that accounts for the interdependence of these characteristics. These structural characteristics are chosen from a large set of variables using stepwise regression of sales prices on these characteristics. The weights used to calculate the Mahalanobis distance measure are the absolute value of the estimated coefficients from this regression====One could then take the average price of these comparables as the assessed value of the target unit. To improve this prediction procedure, a hedonic regression is run using the comparables and the assessed value is the predicted value of the target unit. This is in the spirit of mixed estimators proposed by Imbens and Rubin (2015).==== To assess the prediction accuracy of this procedure, transacted properties are used as target units and their predicted values are compared to the actual sales prices using the mean absolute prediction error (MAPE).====This procedure is applied using single family residential transactions data from 2007 to 2018 in Maricopa County AZ. This includes the city of Phoenix and surrounding areas. This was a period including the Great Recession and its recovery that was particularly impactful in Maricopa County which suffered from significant overbuilding. Real single family residential house prices bottomed out in July 2011 at 36% of the January 2007 value. A steady increase followed, and real prices stood at 66% of this initial value in December 2018. This extreme volatility will likely have a negative impact on the accuracy of land value prediction. Despite this, the best estimators obtain a median prediction accuracy error of 10% and more than 60% of these predictions have a prediction accuracy error within 10% for later years in the sample. These are within the bounds obtained by Zillow for 666 U.S. counties.====This approach is used to estimate market prices that include the value of the structure. This can be thought of as one measure of land value. Another measure is the value of the land without the structure. The ability to calculate this land value is complicated by the fact that most land, particularly in an urbanized area, is improved in some way. Even undeveloped land usually has some improvements such as sewer and water connections and access to paved roads. This is even more so the case with developed land with residential, commercial, or industrial use. One can think of land value as a two-part tariff with the “price of admission” capturing the value of the local amenities that are available to the property in each jurisdiction. In addition, price varies by the lot size that is valued on a price per square foot basis. Both land prices are estimated in this project. This is based on regressions disaggregated by jurisdiction and year to develop time- and market-varying estimates of these land prices.====A goal of this study is to develop a procedure that is relatively simple and easily explainable. While accuracy is clearly preeminent, transparency is also important (McClusky et al. 2013). This comes in the context of the increased use of more complicated procedures such as Globally Weighted Regression (GWR) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) that, particularly for ANN, have a “black box” nature that makes them difficult to explain. Being able to communicate clearly with residents who object to their assessments is important to assessors.====The procedure for best predicting land values is developed in Section 2.

While a large literature has documented the relationship between borrower financial and demographic characteristics and the stability of the mortgage market, the role of co-borrowers is largely overlooked.==== This paper provides stylized and empirical facts associated with co-borrowers in the US mortgage market since the early 1990s. We document that the change in the co-borrower share is heterogeneous across local mortgage markets. Further, this heterogeneity has implications for the performance of local mortgage markets — default rates, house price growth and credit growth.====The paper unfolds in three steps. First, we document changes in the regional distribution of mortgages with a co-borrower. It is known that the co-borrower share – the share of mortgage originations with a co-borrower relative to all mortgage originations – declined in the US since the 1990s (Tzioumis, 2017). However, we show that there is a spatial heterogeneity associated with this decline. Further, this heterogeneity is time-varying. For instance, at the county level, the coefficient of variation of the share increases three-fold since 1992, reaching its peak in 2006 and then drops sharply with the onset of the financial crisis.====In the second step we focus on the role of co-borrowers for mortgage market stability. The presence of a co-borrower significantly decreases the default probability, when compared to mortgage originations that have similar observable characteristics but do not include a co-borrower. Using Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage credit performance data, we show that the co-borrower’s presence reduces the mortgage default probability by more than 60 percent, relative to the average mortgage default probability.====Intuition for the finding – the co-borrower’s presence reduces the mortgage default probability – comes from the double-trigger hypothesis literature. Recent studies have established that households do not default ruthlessly on their mortgages as predicted by models based on option theory (Kau et al., 1992, Kau et al., 1994), but when the event of negative home equity coincides with adverse life events, e.g. an unemployment shock (Schelkle, 2018, Bhutta et al., 2017, Campbell and Cocco, 2015). Under the assumption that most mortgages with a co-borrower are taken by individuals who are bound together by some relation, for example they are married or co-habiting couples, the incidence of double-trigger defaults will be less likely due to within-household risk sharing.====We also show that the performance differential for mortgages with and without a co-borrower varies over time. The discovered time pattern supports the double-trigger hypothesis. The hypothesis predicts that, conditional on home equity, the default rate for mortgages without a co-borrower, relative to mortgages with a co-borrower, will increase during economic downturns: a higher incidence of unemployment shocks during economic downturns would make mortgages without a co-borrower more susceptible to default. We analyze the default differential in different years by focusing on mortgages from the same origination cohort and controlling for loan-level and local mortgage market characteristics, so that levels of home equity would be similar. We find that the difference in default probabilities was the highest for mortgages issued just before the onset of the crisis. Mortgages issued in the early 2000s were 1.5 percentage points more likely to default, if they did not have a co-borrower. However, mortgages issued without a co-borrower just before the crisis were 3.5 percentage points more likely to default than mortgages with a co-borrower. Since more than 50 percent of issued mortgages in 2005 and 2006 did not have a co-borrower, the default probability difference of 3.5 percentage points has significant implications for the mortgage market during the crisis.====After establishing the relationship between the presence of a co-borrower and the mortgage default probability, we show that local mortgage markets with a low co-borrower share have higher default rates. We construct a measure of mortgage credit performance at the local level and find that a one-standard deviation increase in the co-borrower share reduces default measures at the county level by 60 percent of their standard deviation. Hence, the heterogeneous decline in the co-borrower share across the US has led to regional disparities in mortgage default rates.====After documenting stylized facts and the relevance of co-borrowers for the mortgage default probability, in the third step we establish the implications of a low co-borrower share for local mortgage market outcomes. We focus on growth in house prices and growth in purchase and refinance mortgages. Using the difference-in-differences framework, we show that counties with a low co-borrower share prior to the financial crisis experienced lower house price growth, lower refinancing growth and lower growth of credit extended to purchase mortgages. House price growth was lower by one-third of the standard deviation. Other outcomes differed by less than one-third standard deviation, but the difference in all outcomes persisted for three years. We also check the robustness of this result by using the difference-in-differences model in conjunction with propensity score matching.====Higher default rates in regions with a lower co-borrower share suggest a potential explanation for why house price growth and credit growth would be lower too. A large literature shows that foreclosures depress neighborhood prices, e.g. Harding et al., 2009, Campbell et al., 2011, Anenberg and Kung, 2014, Gerardi et al., 2015. Mian et al. (2015) establish that foreclosures accelerate the fall in house prices, consumption and investment. Further, the fall in house prices erodes home equity and limits refinancing opportunities (Beraja et al., 2019).==== Thus, higher default rates in regions with a low co-borrower share could have created spillovers on house prices and other economic outcomes through fire sales. Unlike these studies, we do not prove that higher foreclosures drive the decline in local outcomes. However, our results are robust to controlling for local demand effects, aggregate trends in lending standards and state-level reforms.==== Besides the double-trigger literature, we contribute at the junction of three related fields: regional divergence in the US mortgage market, innovation in the mortgage market and changes in mortgage credit allocation before the financial crisis. A growing literature documents regional divergence within the US mortgage market, especially after the financial crisis, and its implications for the redistribution of resources as well as the effectiveness of monetary policy. Mian et al., 2013, Mian and Sufi, 2014 uncover how the geographic distribution of home equity creates significant wealth effects and tightens credit constraints, leading to changes in local demand, employment and access to credit. Kaplan et al. (2020) obtain similar estimates for the non-durable consumption response and argue that the wealth channel alone is sufficient. Beraja et al. (2019) provide evidence that regions with more deteriorated household balance sheets refinance less even in the environment of low interest rates. Our results point to the co-borrower share as yet another factor that can explain regional divergence within the US mortgage market.====Foote et al. (2018) document technological changes in the US mortgage market. Since the early 1990s, the advancement in information technology, the widespread adoption of credit scoring models and automated underwriting exogenously affected loan processing time and credit allocation. Due to these changes, financial intermediaries relied more on credit scores and less on debt-to-income ratios over time. This paper shows that during the same period, while technological changes were altering the role of loan characteristics in underwriting, the share of mortgages with a co-borrower were also declining. Further, we show that this decline had additional implications for the stability of the mortgage market.====Our paper also relates to research that has analyzed changes in credit allocation in the US mortgage market prior to the crisis. Mian and Sufi (2009) note that mortgage lending standards relaxed and credit was inefficiently allocated to subprime borrowers.==== On the other hand, Adelino et al. (2016) argue that years before the crisis were marked with an increase in mortgage availability across the income distribution. While these papers provide evidence about efficiency, or lack thereof, in allocation of mortgage credit before the crisis, we show that there was another dimension of credit allocation which has been overlooked until now. While mortgages without a co-borrower are more likely to default, a larger section of the market was increasingly captured by these mortgages and lending institutions failed to price the default differential (Tzioumis, 2017).====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section we focus on data description and provide summary statistics. In Section 2 we present stylized facts related to the change in the share of mortgages without a co-borrower. Section 3 establishes the importance of co-borrowers for the stability of the mortgage market and Section 4 focuses on the regional implications of the co-borrower share. Section 5 discusses and concludes.","Bowling alone, buying alone: The decline of co-borrowers in the US mortgage market",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137722000481,9 November 2022,2022,Research Article,23.0

We examine how the implementation of home purchase restrictions (HPR) by the Chinese government in 2017 has affected the market for distressed properties in Beijing. We first use a stylized second-price auction model to derive theoretical predictions for how HPR should impact the number of auction entrants, auction prices/premia, and auction bidders’ average willingness to pay. We then test those predictions using data on court sales from the Taobao online auction platform from 2015 to 2018. By comparing legal auctions of housing before and after April 2017, we obtain empirical results consistent with the model's predictions. Specifically, our analysis documents that auction entrants fell by approximately 70% and auction premia by 16%–27% after the HPR policy was implemented. Furthermore, the average bidder's willingness to pay relative to the seller's valuation fell from 80% to 40%, which suggests that bidders who were affected by HPR had higher valuations, on average, than bidders who weren't.","Distressed property sales are booming in China. According to Bloomberg (2018), distressed property listings on Alibaba's Taobao auction site rose 88% in October 2018 from a year earlier. Annual statistics from the site also show that nationwide, distressed residential property listings increased from 50,000 units in 2014 to 240,000 units in 2018 (Li, 2019). The cause of this rapid increase in distressed property sales is no mystery to economists: With bad loans rising and property prices falling, cash-strapped homeowners and business operators either paid a high price at the peak, with small down payments, or used their properties as a security against a business that has defaulted. Since China's economy is slowing down due to stagnant economic reforms and the Covid-19 pandemic, more distressed properties will be on the market in the foreseeable future. Given the size of bad loans and high leverage in the Chinese real estate market, an efficient and well-regulated market for distressed property sales is crucial to the Chinese economy and its financial stability. Compared with studies on distressed or foreclosed property sales in Western countries (Mayer, 1995; Harding et al., 2009; Anenberg and Kung, 2014; Chow et al., 2015; Gerardi et al., 2015; Donner et al., 2016; Chomsisengphet et al., 2018; Arefeva, 2020), research on China's distressed property market is limited.====In China, distressed property sales due to bankruptcy or foreclosure are carried out by court order. For the sake of transparency and efficiency in the distressed property market, since 2010 court sales have taken the form of online auctions on court-approved IT platforms, such as the Alibaba Group's Taobao auction site (similar to eBay). Compared with normal sales, residential properties sold by court order carry the stigma of being a forced sale and typically sell at a discount of their market value (Li, 2019).==== Thus, getting a bargain is one of the main reasons people buy distressed properties. Another reason is that forced sales by court order are generally exempt from home purchase restrictions (HPR) in some of China's largest cities.==== Thus, normally restricted buyers, such as non-local residents or residents who are not eligible to purchase in a normal market, can actively participate in the distressed market.====In this study, we use online court auctions for distressed properties in Beijing, China, to analyse market activities in and regulatory impacts on the distressed property market. We identify a unique situation in which, prior to April 2017, distressed property sales through court order in Beijing were exempt from HPR. We call this the HPR loophole. Our main proposition is that specific restrictions on the types of buyers who can enter foreclosure auctions can significantly affect auction entry and auction prices. On the one hand, the policy reduces the number of potential bidders in the market; not surprisingly, we find that restricting buyers from a market reduces effective demand and pushes auction prices down. On the other hand, and conditional on the number of market participants (i.e., the number of auction bidders), the impact of closing the HPR loophole also depends on how the valuation distributions between restricted and non-restricted buyers are related. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to show that non-restricted home buyers have a lower value distribution than that of restricted buyers in the market. Overall, a bidder's willingness to payࣧmeasured by that bidder's chance of being a high-value bidder with an ex ante price expectation above the seller's valuation in the auction—dropped from 80% before the restriction to 40% after the HPR policy was enacted.====This paper contributes to the literature in several ways. First, our study contributes to the literature on empirical HPR studies (e.g., Du and Zhang, 2015; Li and Xu, 2016; Li et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2017; Jia et al., 2018; Yan and Quyang, 2018; Wu and Li, 2018; Somerville et al., 2019). The HPR policy studied in this paper is an amendment of the policy that was in place in April 2017. Property sales by court order in Beijing were exempt from HPR before April 2017. Thus, this amendment enables us to document the true impact of HPR on the housing market when we compare legal auctions of housing before and after April 2017. In contrast to previous HPR studies, our analysis is set within a well-defined online auction market for distressed property sales in which the auction starting (reserve) price, the seller's valuation, the number of bidders, and whether the property was sold at auction are clearly observable. This means that we can include a set of auction data in our model specifications, which allows us to quantitatively identify the policy effect on auction entry, auction premia and bidders’ value types in the foreclosure housing market. Our identification strategy assumes that once a seller's valuation and reserve price are known in the market, it is up to buyers to enter and make an offer at auction.====Second, we theoretically model the effect of HPR on auctions. Our main theoretical contributions are new comparative statistics results specific to the housing market. The auction as a sales mechanism has been well documented in the literature (Klemperer, 2004; Menezes and Monteiro, 2005). In the real estate literature, most studies focus on comparing auctions with private negotiation, with little discussion of asymmetric bidders—i.e., restricted (investors) and non-restricted (homebuyers) buyers (e.g., Yavas and Yang, 1995; Lusht, 1996; Quan, 2002; Gan, 2013; Chow et al., 2015; Khezr, 2018). Theoretically, our auction model is closely related to work on auctions with insurance (Hafalir and Yektas, 2011); bankruptcy (Zheng, 2001); and return policies (Cadsby et al., 2016). In those papers, the winner collects more information after the auction and has the option of not proceeding with the purchase, but incurs a cost (or fee) for withdrawal. In contrast, we assume that a winner's default probability is exogenously given and not a decision by the winner.====Lastly, our findings have important policy implications—not only for China but also for a broader set of policies in other countries. Depending on the goals of an HPR policy and local housing market conditions, local governments can choose whether to restrict buyers in the property market. Compared with other types of policies, restrictions on the types of buyers (i.e., through additional tax or financial regulations) that are designed to lower their bids are more desirable if they do not completely forbid such buyers from participating in an auction. In China, distressed properties are already sold at a discount, and further direct-purchase restrictions could trigger significant price reductions and severe liquidity problems in the distressed property market.====In the next section, we review the background of online court sales for distressed properties and the HPR policy in Beijing. We then present the theoretical and empirical approaches we use in the analysis, describe the data, discuss the results and present our conclusions.",The impact of a home purchase restrictions (HPR) policy on the distressed property market in Beijing,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137722000493,6 November 2022,2022,Research Article,24.0

Rooted in ====, the model optimizes how to combine common improved property sales with rare, but more informative, ==== sales. It estimates how land values change with geography and other features, and determines how much information either vacant or improved sales provide to nearby areas through two levels of spatial correlation. For most neighborhoods, incorporating improved sales often doubles the certainty of land value estimates. Relative to conventional estimators, our method mitigates problems from excess variance and sample selection.","Valuing land accurately and objectively is possibly the most formidable technical barrier to taxing land value (Mills, 1998). Sales of vacant land are rare, especially in built-up areas, where values are the highest. Furthermore, vacant properties may be difficult to compare, since land values can change considerably over short distances or brief periods of time (Ashley et al., 1999, Gloudemans et al., 2002, Bell and Bowman, 2006). On the other hand, improved, i.e., non-vacant, properties sell much more frequently, but are even more difficult to compare. Such properties pair land with improvements that range from a bungalow to a super-tall skyscraper.====Recent advances in data science and statistical methods may mitigate many challenges to valuing land when properly applied. Our goal here is to optimally combine small numbers of vacant property sales with large numbers of improved property sales to provide a credible prediction of what price any lot would be worth if it were vacant. In the process, we learn more about the economics of how much an improved property’s value is due solely to its land.====The statistical learning approach we develop here is unique in how it values vacant and improved lots jointly, making use of their neighboring locations. This method can be applied in many settings as the data required are available to most assessors. Assessors commonly make subjective judgments as to what properties are comparable. In contrast, the statistical learning approach determines what lots are comparable more objectively, based on how well the value of vacant and improved properties predict each other’s values throughout the data. The approach even accounts for idiosyncrasies that may make any one observed transaction price for a property less than fully representative of the typical price that a property would sell for, if it were sold repeatedly. These “shrinkage” methods are used to reduce the influence of outliers.====Mathematically, our learning approach uses a multilevel Bayesian framework that constructs a posterior distribution of unknown parameters, assumed to have a diffuse and uninformative prior distribution. These parameters have a hierarchical structure. A large number of lower-order parameters describe a flexible land-value surface. These are generated from a conditional distribution, which depends on a smaller number of higher-order hyper-parameters. These hyper-parameters teach us more about the abstract qualities of land values, and how they interact with improved property values. The parameters are estimated sequentially in a loop through an iterative standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method.====This framework is practically useful for several reasons. First, the MCMC posterior simulator we develop – a variant of a Gibbs samplers – works quite well for a large model with over 900 parameters. Second, it offers a convenient yet coherent way to construct a full predictive distribution that accounts for parameter uncertainty. This allows one to characterize uncertainty around the land values predicted by the model. It also provides safeguards around issues of “overfitting” from using too little data to identify too many parameters. In a sense, land values are “shrunk” not only using vacant land observed further away, but also using land values one would predict from improved properties observed nearby.====This flexible, non-parametric technique resembles others based on moving averages, kernel density, or Kriging.==== What makes our model different from others is that it simultaneously models a vacant land-value function with an improved property-value function, estimating the two correlated non-parametric functions jointly. This joint estimation reduces the uncertainty of land-value estimates drawn from the data. In our example below, the extra information contained in the improved sales data reduces this uncertainty by over 50%.",A statistical learning approach to land valuation: Optimizing the use of external information,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137722000456,31 October 2022,2022,Research Article,26.0

Though they are central to household and firm location choices, land-only sales in urban areas are rare and often outliers. Indeed, urban areas are in part defined by a largely contiguous area of high land-use intensity – those places in which developable land is scarce. In this article, we make use of more-commonly available market data to infer land prices: single-family house sales. Each house sale contains an underlying land parcel that contributes to the property price. Importantly, house sales are far more common and offer significantly more spatial coverage than do land-only sales. Our contribution is a novel method for extracting the level of land prices by exploiting information about location value that is implicitly embedded into each house sale. Our method reveals the benefits of acknowledging spatial and temporal variations in the implicit prices of housing characteristics. Doing so allows us to uncover a much richer land price surface. Our method makes use of standard tools and freely available software, making it a feasible and generalizable alternative to traditional approaches. Moreover, it obviates the reliance on strong assumptions about uniform implicit pricing and static fixed effects that are somewhat in conflict with the dynamic housing and land markets we are attempting to study.====It is very common to use location fixed effects in hedonic house price regressions. These are problematic when housing submarkets within metropolitan areas evolve asymmetrically over time. But more to the specific issue of land prices: the coefficients on the location dummies do not reveal the ==== of land prices. Rather, these coefficients are estimates of the location premium of a ==== in one place relative to another. In this article, we develop a statistically rigorous, straightforward, and tractable method by which vacant land sales on the periphery of a metropolitan area can be used to estimate underlying implicit land values throughout the city, including areas in which there are few or no vacant lot sales.====A practical barrier to measuring land prices is the fact that real estate is a bundled good, containing both land and structures. Moreover, both of these bundled goods are themselves heterogeneous. While land prices are determined in large measure by local amenities and disamenities that are external to a site, the ability to develop on a parcel in order to capture local amenities is partially determined by the parcel's size and shape. While there are regularities in this regard by neighborhood and vintage, they are far from homogeneous. And, of course, the structures that comprise the second part of the bundle also vary widely, as seen by the diversity of single-family residences across metropolitan areas. Existing technology addresses this heterogeneity but does not recover land prices. Our innovation lies in how we use this technology and the resulting estimated coefficients in conjunction with raw land sales to infer land prices throughout a metropolitan area.====Our analysis involves a two-step process. In the first step, we use single-family residential sales data to estimate a constant-quality price surface using a locally weighted regression (LWR) model. The key advantage of using LWR is its inherent flexibility to recover ==== pricing of dwelling attributes. By estimating the price function independently at each sale location, the Law of One Price is imposed, but only very locally; the data thus reveal spatial patterns in implicit prices of housing characteristics across the metropolitan area. As a result, this LWR methodology avoids the significant omitted variable problems that would otherwise plague the location fixed effect coefficients estimated in a traditional hedonic model. Using the coefficient vectors from the set of local regressions, we estimate a property value surface for a “standardized housing unit” at each and every location in the city. Importantly, this standardized housing unit is hypothetical and does not reflect the actual structures on parcels across the city. Instead, it is used to ask what each parcel would be worth if it had the same physical structure on it.====Because the value of the standardized structure (its construction cost less accrued depreciation) will not vary across the metropolitan area, this standardized property value surface implicitly measures the relative premia for different locations in the city. It does not, however, “pin down” precise land values for each property. That is, the standardized surface is obtained by pricing an identical housing bundle at every location, where this bundle includes both the typical dwelling characteristics and the typical lot characteristics. We recover land prices by fitting this standardized surface to the few land sales we do observe. Although there are relatively few sales of vacant lots in the core, there are many vacant lot sales at the periphery. Moreover, in many of these neighborhoods on the edge of the city, both vacant lot and completed dwelling sales occur at roughly the same time.====Using this fact, the second step of our analysis involves using vacant land sales in neighborhoods on the periphery to pin down the absolute level of the standardized value surface estimated in the first step. With this calibration, we can theoretically use the standardized value surface to estimate land values throughout the city, including in those neighborhoods without vacant lot sales.====In order to “pin down” the relative value surface, we identify several neighborhoods with both improved parcel and vacant lot sales. In these neighborhoods, we use the improved-parcel regression results to estimate the value of the standardized dwelling in these neighborhoods. Subtracting off the value of the typical lot in these neighborhoods provides an estimate of the implied value of the standardized improvements.====These steps are justified by the standard urban economics assumption that local amenities and disamenities should be capitalized into land values, not structure values. The locally weighted regressions allow the standardized structure to be priced everywhere, which explicitly holds constant the physical characteristics of improvements to the property at each location. By subtracting off the value of this standardized dwelling structure – which once again should be invariant across the community – we are able to make use of amenity capitalization in dwelling sales to recover land prices throughout the metropolitan area.====It is worth noting that while we make use of the tautology that the overall property value can be separated into its land and structure components additively, this imposes no restrictions on the functional form of the locally weighted regressions used to estimate these value surfaces. In our case, we use a traditional log-log specification to estimate housing values, but our methodology for extracting land values would work equally well regardless of the specific regression model specification employed.====The land surfaces we estimate are consistent with our understanding of two markets with distinctly different urban dynamics: Phoenix, Arizona and Wichita, Kansas. Phoenix is a rapidly growing metropolitan area with varied barriers to growth at its periphery. In contrast, Wichita grows very slowly and approximates the classic flat featureless plain of urban economic theory. Nevertheless, the land-value surfaces we estimate for these two disparate markets show striking similarities. In particular, they tend to show higher land values toward the center of the cities, especially in comparison with the spatial distribution of sale prices of single-family homes, which tend to show the highest values at the periphery of the city. This is consistent with the notion that smaller, older homes are located closer to the center of city on higher valued lots, while larger, high-end structures are built at the periphery on relatively lower valued lots.====In the next section we discuss the challenges associated with estimating lot values using single-family residential sales data, as well as recent related research. We contrast this research with our own empirical strategy.

We exhibit discrimination in that atypical tenants (e.g., single elderlies, single mothers, and foreigners) are likely to be rejected at the moving-in inspection, even after controlling for their estimated probability of getting into rent arrears using observable traits of individual tenants, including payment ability measures. This can be taste-based and/or statistical discrimination, the latter of which reflects the other potential costs for owners to accommodate atypical tenants, such as the risk of getting into trouble with neighbors. More specifically, statistical discrimination based on their high risk of rent arrears does not exist clearly, as much as the risk is explained by their observable traits, including their weak payment ability. Moreover, the study illustrates that the probability of acceptance at the moving-in inspection is reduced by unreasonable moving behaviors—a move to a place that does not require a moderate ","One of the central goals of housing policy is to offer a safety net of housing for everyone, to prevent them from becoming homeless. In Japan and many Western countries, the construction of social housing (public housing) has long satisfied such needs. In recent housing policy, however, the role of social housing has become smaller, and private rental housing is now serving the role of providing tenure security even for socially vulnerable tenants (Fields and Uffer, 2016; Gilbert, 2016; Kirchner, 2007).====In the private rental housing market, however, not all applicants can successfully find a place to live. Potential tenants need to pass a moving-in inspection before signing a rental contract between themselves and the owners. The moving-in inspection can be strict in the private rental housing market because of the risk of rent arrears—tenants failing to pay rent on time.====In this context, discrimination may arise for the ‘atypical’ type of tenants because owners may find it difficult to appropriately assess their risk, either from the owner's previous experience or from general experiences in society. This may pose a significant challenge in the recent divergence of tenant types in developed countries. Thereby, atypical types of households that deviate from the traditional style of the family are increasing due to unstable employment and long-lasting economic stagnation (Hirayama, 2010a). An increasing number of elderly are now reverting to the rental sector after owning a house, which has long been the goal of the traditional property ladder (Abramsson and Andersson, 2012, 2016). Globalization has led to the accumulation of ethnic minorities in global cities.====Discrimination based on ethnicity and/or gender in the rental housing market has been investigated in the Western context, and most of the literature is based on field experiments, such as audit and correspondence studies (Ahmed et al., 2010; Ahmed and Hammarstedt, 2008; Baldini and Federici, 2011; Bosch et al., 2010; Carlsson and Eriksson, 2014; Carpusor and Loges, 2006; Hanson and Hawley, 2011; Hellyer, 2021; Hogan and Berry, 2011; Yinger, 1986). Researchers typically send applications or inquiries regarding the availability/vacancy of the properties with applicant names that are common for white and ethnic minorities. There is little evidence on the actual moving-in inspection process at the contract stage—after the real estate agents decide to forward the tenants to the owners—and its relationship with the rent arrear tendency.====This is contrary to the attempt to capture the inspection process of mortgages for owner-occupied housing, which takes into account the possibility of future mortgage arrears and default. In the US, research on the role of income and race in consumer lending of mortgages found strong evidence that lenders were denying credit more frequently to black households than to white households with similar observable characteristics (Duca and Rosenthal, 1993; Ladd, 1998; Munnell et al., 1996; Ross and Yinger, 2002). Beyond loan denials, analyses have recently been extended to risk-based pricing of credit, which may have become another channel for discrimination (Agarwal et al., 2011; Ghent et al., 2014; Haughwout et al., 2009). Specifically, when borrowers choose among several different sets of loan terms, each with a different price, minorities may be able to obtain credit but may have to pay a higher price for it.====This paper documents the discrimination against the ‘atypical’ type of tenants in the Tokyo private rental housing market, using tenant-level records on the moving-in inspection process and future rent arrears, which go beyond previous experimental and audit studies on the availability of listing rental properties. We exhibit discrimination in that atypical tenants (e.g., single elderlies, single mothers, and foreigners) are likely to be rejected at the moving-in inspection, even after controlling for their estimated probability of getting into rent arrears using observable traits of individual tenants, including payment ability measures. This can be taste-based and/or statistical discrimination, the latter of which reflects the other potential costs for owners to accommodate atypical tenants, such as the risk of getting into trouble with neighbors. More specifically, statistical discrimination based on their high risk of rent arrears does not exist clearly, as much as the risk is explained by their observable traits, including their weak payment ability. Moreover, the study illustrates that the probability of acceptance at the moving-in inspection is reduced by unreasonable moving behaviors—a move to a place that does not require a moderate commuting distance, a move within the same community, and an increase in commuting distance than before, and in units with low rental costs.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 develops a conceptual framework of the discrimination against the atypical type of tenants at the moving-in inspection, considering the risk of future rent arrears. Section 3 describes the dataset and basic facts. Section 4 describes our empirical methodology. Section 5 shows the empirical results of the rent arrears evaluation and moving-in inspection process.

Jensen (2007) and Aker (2010), for example, show how an improved information technology shock has led to a decline in price dispersion in the fishing industry in India and across grain markets in Niger; and Ben-Shahar and Golan (2019) show that an unexpected public disclosure of transaction price information has led to decreased price dispersion in the Israeli housing market.====The economics literature has extensively studied the conditions that lead to price dispersion. Theoretical studies indicate that the prevalence of price dispersion may stem from the cost of information collection (e.g., Stigler 1961, Rothschild 1973, Janssen and Moraga-González 2004, Janssen et al. 2005) and consumer heterogeneity in a “clearinghouse” setting (e.g., Salop and Stiglitz 1977, Varian 1980, Baye and Morgan 2001, Baye et al. 2004). Empirical studies of price dispersion address factors such as the number of competing sellers in the market (Borenstein and Rose, 1994; Barron et al., 2004; Lewis, 2008; Chandra and Tappata, 2011); the value of the good (e.g., Pratt et al. 1979, Gatti and Kattuman 2003, Eckard 2004); search cost (e.g., Marvel 1976, Brynjolfsson and Smith 2000, Smith and Brynjolfsson 2001, Brown and Goolsbee 2002, Dinlersoz and Li 2006, Chandra and Tappata 2011); and purchase frequency (e.g., Sorensen 2000).====Building on the above literature, in this study we empirically examine the effect of price dispersion in housing market transactions on time-on-market. Specifically, we employ the universe of all housing market transaction prices in the 53 most active (of the 76) cities in Israel over the period 2010–2013 to estimate the dispersion of quality-adjusted housing prices over time and across locations. We then employ a dataset of housing units listed for sale on the leading online classified home service in Israel (“Yad2″) between 2010 and 2013 (to which we were granted special access) in order to assess the association between quality-adjusted housing market price dispersion and the hazard of achieving a sale (time-on-market).====Based on controlled estimation of a Cox proportional hazard model, we find that housing market price dispersion is negatively associated with the hazard of a sale. Specifically, we find that a 1% increase in the standard deviation of the quality-adjusted housing price is associated with a decrease of about 0.63% in the likelihood of a sale. The result is robust to a series of sampling and test-design specifications.====Several real estate studies relate to our analysis. The most relevant, by Kotova and Zhang (2020), documents U.S. housing market evidence, according to which price dispersion is positively correlated with time-on-market. While this finding is consistent with our results, our empirical approach differs considerably. In particular, as compared to Kotova and Zhang's idiosyncratic unit-level price dispersion measure that is based on repeat-sales, we use a quality-adjusted, sub-market-level price dispersion that includes the universe of transactions in a given sub-market. Furthermore, unlike Kotova and Zhang's OLS estimation, our panel data allow us to exhaust all available information by estimating a Cox proportional hazard model.==== Also, Leung et al. (2006) examine macroeconomic factors that are associated with housing market price dispersion. Importantly, however, and in contrast to Leung ====., we estimate price dispersion based on quality-adjusted prices, controlling for variation in housing asset characteristics. In addition, a number of studies specifically examine the effect of information on price dispersion and time-on-market in the housing market. Eerola and Lyytikäinen (2015) use a sample of transactions in the Helsinki (Finland) housing market to explore the effect of an improved information shock on the price level and time-on-market of transacted assets. Ben-Shahar and Golan (2019) employ a natural experimental framework in Israel whereby housing transaction information was suddenly and unexpectedly disclosed to the public to study the effect of an improved price information shock on housing price dispersion. Finally, by proposing new measures for assessing housing price information, Kotsenko (2018) studies the effect of price information in the Israeli market on price distribution and time-on-market.====Following Jensen (2007), Aker (2010), and Ben-Shahar and Golan (2019), who show that improved information is associated with decreased price dispersion, the primary contribution of this research is in showing that decreased price dispersion in the housing market is further associated with increased hazard of a sale (i.e., decreased time-on-market). As the latter carries vital positive welfare effects in the form of decreased transaction costs that accompany time, search, and negotiations required for closing a transaction, our outcomes support the call for promoting and improving the transparency and availability of information in the housing market.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

We use two approaches to estimate land values. The first approach is a Stein-like procedure that uses teardown properties and makes efficient use of limited data when a group of variables – in this case, the structural characteristics – is expected beforehand to provide little explanatory power. The second approach is based on an unconditional expectation for the pooled data set of teardown and non-teardown sales. We use data from Chicago and Maricopa County to demonstrate the two approaches. These approaches help to estimate land values in built-up areas where ==== sales are uncommon and unrepresentative of land values in the market.","Land values are a critical component of urban economic theory. As developed by Alonso (1964), Muth (1969), and Mills (1972), the standard monocentric city model implies that the value of access to the workplace is capitalized directly into land values. Land values guide the conversion of land from agriculture to urban use, the redevelopment of urban land to alternative uses, and the timing of land developments (Braid, 2001; Brueckner, 1980; Wheaton, 1982). Restrictive zoning practices can lead to sharp increases in land values in jurisdictions where land becomes difficult to develop. Studies such as Brueckner et al. (2017), Brueckner and Singh (2020), Cheshire and Sheppard (2002), Glaeser, Gyourko, and Saks (2005) make use of land values to measure the extent to which zoning alters market outcomes. Though accurate measures of land values are necessary to test many of the implications of urban economic theory, a lack of good data sources for land values has led empirical researchers to devote more attention to testing the models’ implications for such variables as population density and house prices.====The ability to measure land values accurately also has immense practical importance. In many jurisdictions, assessors are required to provide separate assessments for structures and land. Differential tax rates for land and structures have been proposed since the time of Henry George, and have been employed in Pennsylvania with some success (Oates and Schwab, 1997). Since the supply of land is close to perfectly inelastic, a land tax could potentially be an attractive substitute for a more conventional property tax (England, 2003). Successful implementation of a land tax has been impeded by questions concerning the accuracy of current assessment practices for land values.====Land values are difficult to measure in urban areas in part because vacant land sales are not common. Sales of vacant land are often concentrated in a small number of places and may be unrepresentative of the overall market. Nevertheless, many researchers have used vacant land sales to estimate land values in urban areas. Examples include Colwell and Munneke (1997), Thorsnes (1997), Cunningham (2006), and Ihlanfeldt (2007). Other researchers have attempted to use sales prices of developed properties to estimate land values. After controlling for the effects of structural characteristics, land value is treated either as a residual or is estimated directly from the coefficients for land area and various location characteristics (e.g., Jackson, Johnson and Kaserman, 1984; Cheshire and Sheppard, 1995; Glaeser, Gyourko, and Saks, 2005). However, land values are difficult to estimate accurately using hedonic price functions because it is impossible to control completely for the myriad characteristics that influence a property's sales price. Hedonic estimates of land value tend to be biased upward in desirable areas when unobserved variables such as structure quality are positively correlated with variables representing characteristics of the location.====Teardowns – properties that are demolished shortly after being purchased – offer an attractive data source for estimating land values in built-up urban areas. As noted by Rosenthal and Helsley (1994), the value of a teardown property is approximately equal to the value of the land on which it rests minus any demolition costs. Since demolition costs comprise a very small percentage of sales prices in areas where teardowns are common, teardowns can be a very useful tool for estimating land values in areas where vacant land is uncommon. Teardowns have been used to estimate land values in studies by Rosenthal and Helsley (1994), Munneke (1996), McGrath (2000), Dye and McMillen (2007), and McMillen and O'Sullivan (2013). Gedal and Ellen (2018) directly compare land value estimates obtained using teardowns with vacant land sales and conclude that teardown sales produce more precise estimates of land value and are more representative of the full city of New York.====In this paper, we propose two procedures for using teardown sales to value urban land. Our first approach is based on an estimator proposed by Knight, Hill, and Sirmans (1993). They refer to their formula for combining the restricted and unrestricted estimates as a “Stein-like” rule since it is an extension of Stein's (1956) estimator for the means of variables drawn from a multivariate normal distribution. The idea is to improve the efficiency of hedonic price function estimates by calculating weighted averages of estimates obtained from unrestricted models that have a large of number of explanatory variables and restricted models that omit variables that are expected beforehand to have little influence on sales prices. The approach is well suited to teardown sales because structural characteristics should have little or no explanatory power for the sale price of teardown properties, a prediction that is supported empirically in the studies by Dye and McMillen (2007) and McMillen and O'Sullivan (2013). A weighted average of estimates with and without structural characteristics allows us to more precisely estimate the coefficients on the variables representing characteristics of the lot and location. This use of non-sample information – the theoretical prediction that structural characteristics have no effect on the sales prices of teardown properties – leads to little bias and much lower variance for the location variable coefficients.====A disadvantage of this weighted average approach is the sample is limited to teardown sales. Our second approach takes advantage of both teardown and non-teardown sales, which can significantly increase the efficiency of the estimates if the coefficients for lot size and the location variables are the same for the two types of properties. Our approach is based on the unconditional expectation of sale price. The resulting estimating equation implies that the variables representing characteristics of the structure should be multiplied by the probability that the property was sold as a non-teardown. As the teardown probability approaches one, the structural variables are implied to have no effect on sale price.====We use data from four markets in Maricopa County, Arizona, and a set of six neighborhoods in Chicago to illustrate our approaches. We use data from these two regions as there are interesting differences between them. Chicago has many old homes that have depreciated or otherwise do not match the preferences of the current housing market. Moreover, there is likely to be more variation in land values both within and across neighborhoods in Chicago due to the access to the EL and other walkable neighborhood amenities as compared to car-dependent Maricopa County.====The Maricopa County data set includes relatively few teardown sales. In contrast, about 8.5% of the sales in the Chicago data set are teardowns. Although teardowns may be a useful tool for estimating land values in Maricopa County, they are critical in this region of Chicago where vacant land sales are scarce and all land is developed. In this situation, teardowns can greatly increase the precision and geographic detail of land value assessments. An advantage of using teardown properties to estimate land values is that they are less prone to bias associated with unobservable structural characteristics. Additionally, teardowns are useful for estimating land values in areas where vacant land sales are uncommon or unrepresentative of the market.",Land value estimation using teardowns,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137722000468,13 October 2022,2022,Research Article,30.0

We compare hedonic, residual, and matching techniques for mass appraisal of residential land values, using data from Maricopa County, Arizona. The first method involves a hedonic valuation model estimated for transactions of vacant lots. The second approach subtracts the depreciated cost of improvements from the value of improved properties to obtain land value as a residual. The third approach matches the sales of vacant lots with subsequent sales of the same properties once they have been developed. For each pair, we use a land price index to inflate the land price to the time of the improved property transaction and then calculate land leverage (the ratio of land to total property value). A hedonic model is estimated and used to predict land leverage for all improved properties. We conclude that the matching approach is the most promising of the methods considered.","Land valuation is important for multiple reasons. It is central to land taxation, two-rate taxation of land and buildings, and the taxation of land value increments. Decomposing the value of properties into their land and structure components is also important for understanding house price dynamics (Bostic ====, 2007; Bourassa ====., 2009; Zhou and Haurin, 2010; Knoll ====., 2017) and understanding the role of land price changes over time (Bourassa ====., 2011; Diewert ====., 2015; Davis ====., 2017; Davis ====., 2021). However, it has proven extraordinarily challenging to estimate land values for improved properties in an efficient and accurate manner. Holland (1970) devoted an entire book of edited papers to this topic and the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy has continued to address this issue by supporting research on the topic (====., Netzer, 1998; Bell ====., 2009). As one of the contributors to Holland (1970) observed, “any conception that the valuation of land is a simple and easy process is founded on pure illusion” (Back, 1970, p. 54).====Our aim is to explore the usefulness of hedonic, residual, and matching techniques for estimating residential land values. For that purpose, we use vacant land and improved single-family property sales data as well as the full roster of single-family properties from Maricopa County, Arizona. To be cost-effective, methods need to be accurate and reasonably easy to apply in a mass appraisal context. Hence our emphasis is on automated valuation techniques that are sufficiently straightforward to be applied by a typical urban county property appraiser's office and we do not consider more complex approaches such as machine learning (for examples of the latter, see Mayer ====., 2019).====Hedonic models are widely used in the context of property valuation, especially residential property valuation (for a review, see Malpezzi, 2003). Information about a sample of properties that transacted is used to estimate models that can predict the values of out-of-sample properties that did not transact. Hedonic models are a valuable tool for property tax appraisers, mortgage underwriters, valuation firms, and regulatory authorities. Popular online resources, such as Zillow.com in the United States, rely on such models to provide regularly updated estimates of property values.====In addition to their use for valuation of improved properties, hedonic models can also be used for land valuation. Hedonic models of improved properties have been used to infer land values (====, Wentland ====., 2020), but this is problematic because the estimated coefficients for some variables may reflect the influence of both land and improvement characteristics.==== For example, the intercept terms and time dummies in hedonic models for improved properties relate to both land and improvements. Moreover, we show that most hedonic coefficients for land-related variables for improved properties differ significantly from those for vacant land.====In practice, the estimation of such models is hampered by insufficient transactions pertaining to vacant and redevelopment land in the more central locations of cities, even though the overall sample of land sales for a metropolitan area may be quite large.==== The Phoenix MSA sample used by Nichols ====. (2013) contains 18,249 land sales (8,472 commercial and 9,777 residential) for 1995 to 2011, but these are unlikely to be distributed evenly over space and time due to uneven geographic patterns of development as well as economic cycles. Gedal and Ellen (2018), for instance, report that vacant parcels in New York City sold between 2003 and 2009 were disproportionately located in distressed neighborhoods. To address the issue of the paucity of vacant land transactions and obtain a sample that would be more uniformly distributed across space, several papers have focused on using data from teardown values (prices paid for properties purchased for demolition and redevelopment). Been ====. (2009) use teardown values to measure land price changes in New York, following an approach suggested by Rosenthal and Helsley (1994) and extended by Dye and McMillen (2007). Using data for New York City, Gedal and Ellen (2018) conclude that teardown parcels appear to be more representative of the city as a whole and may be a more useful approach to developing estimates of land prices, at least in the central cities of large urban areas.====The residual approach, which subtracts an appraised value of the structure from total property value to yield land value, is not commonly used as a mass appraisal technique for residential land. However, it has been used in the context of estimating land leverage—====., the ratio of land value to overall property value—and for land price index construction. Davis and Palumbo (2008), for instance, focus on 46 large U.S. metropolitan areas and show that land leverage for single-family owner-occupied homes increased from an average of 32 percent in 1984 to 51 percent in 2004. The authors price the housing stock in each area using depreciated construction costs applied to property characteristics contained in the American Housing Survey (AHS) for a benchmark year. Land value is the total property value reported in the AHS less the depreciated value of the structure. Bourassa ====. (2011) use a similar approach to extract land values from transaction prices for single-family homes in Switzerland. The authors use hedonic models to develop time series of land prices and land leverage. Davis ====. (2017) use property-level data to estimate the price of land for detached single-family homes in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. They measure the value of land for newly built homes as the difference between the sale price and estimated construction cost for the structure. Davis ==== (2021) use Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) appraisal data, which allow them to estimate land leverage and land values for census tracts throughout the U.S. They find that the residual method works well for about the first 20 years of the life of the structure and, consequently, base their estimates on properties with relatively new structures. One issue with implementing the residual method in a mass appraisal context is that information about the characteristics of structures is unlikely to be as detailed or precise as one would like. Also, assumptions about construction costs and depreciation rates may be inaccurate.====Our third approach involves matching vacant land sales with subsequent transactions once those parcels have been developed.==== For each pair of sales, the value of the structure is calculated as the improved sale price minus the historical land price inflated over the period between the vacant land and improved property transactions. This approach allows us to compute land leverage for each matched improved property, which is then used as the dependent variable in a model containing property characteristics as independent variables. The estimates from this model are used to predict land leverage for other properties.==== One potential limitation of this approach is that the matched properties may not be representative of all properties. Also, the application of this method to markets other than Maricopa County depends on the availability of vacant land transactions that can then be matched to subsequent sales of improved properties.====We compare hedonic, residual, and matching methods for valuing single-family residential land. Our hedonic approach focuses on vacant land transactions, using data for the entire county as well as one submarket with a relatively large number of land sales. We conclude that this method does not perform well within sample and, hence, would be inaccurate as a means for out-of-sample prediction. We also show that a hedonic model of improved properties cannot be used to infer land values. We then apply the residual approach to improved properties that transacted and also conclude that the within-sample performance is less than satisfactory. Finally, we implement our third method by matching vacant land and subsequent improved property transactions, calculating the land leverage ratio, and then estimating a model with that ratio as dependent variable. We then use that model to predict land leverage for all other single-family properties. Although previous research has matched vacant land transactions with subsequent sales once the land has been improved (Bostic ====., 2007), we believe this paper is the first to then use a land leverage regression model to predict land leverage for every single-family property in a market. We conclude that this method yields reasonable estimates of land value and has potential for practical application.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. We next discuss our methods before turning to a description of the Maricopa County data.

Existing research suggests that consumers are inattentive to such costs when making small purchases. There is less evidence about attention to costs associated with large purchases. This paper examines ==== transactions and studies the extent to which sale prices adjust to ownership costs. The results are inconclusive, neither ruling out full price adjustment nor lack of price adjustment. Despite the inconclusive result, the inability to decisively rule out incomplete price adjustment to predictable ownership costs (which is suggestive of inattention) is noteworthy, given the high financial stakes of buying a home.","Every day, consumers make decisions that have costs that may not be salient at the time of purchase. Some of these costs are small, such as the sales tax on a $20 drug store purchase or the electricity cost differential between CFL and incandescent light bulbs, and some are larger, such as the operating cost of home heating appliances. When the stakes are small, ignoring or partially ignoring these costs may be rational or, if unintentional, nearly costless. When the stakes are higher, the cost of inattention is also higher, but whether consumers ignore costs in high stakes decisions, particularly those made infrequently, is theoretically ambiguous. The higher stakes of large decisions may result in fewer mistakes because the consumer, knowing the gravity of the situation, takes time to carefully consider all costs and benefits; however, consumers may make more optimization mistakes in infrequent decisions because there are fewer opportunities to learn how to make such decisions. Evidence of inattention in such cases speaks to the question of whether consumers are unintentionally (rather than rationally) inattentive. When the stakes are high, the benefit of paying attention is more likely to exceed the effort and time costs of doing so. Observing inattention in these cases may be an indication that inattention is not rational, though to make strong claims one would need measures of mental effort and beliefs.====To contribute to this question, I study a high stakes decision that consumers make infrequently and explore whether prices adjust to large costs that are not included in sticker prices. Studying such decisions is important because the effects (on markets or welfare, for example) of any inattention in these cases are more likely to be materially relevant. The particular decision I study is the decision to buy a home, arguably the largest financial decision most consumers make. The main application examines the market for single family homes in suburban California. To address potential alternative explanations and to widen the scope of evidence, a second application studies the market for condominiums in San Francisco, though for brevity many details are left to the appendix.====The main application investigates the extent to which direct levies (annual charges similar to property taxes) are incorporated into sale prices of homes in California. Relying on unique features of direct levies imposed by a particular type of special district, this setting employs a border discontinuity design to exploit variation in direct levies caused by the borders between these special districts. Because the direct levies fund non-excludable public goods, these charges represent an extra cost, without providing additional services, to the homeowners in special districts with large direct levies (the high tax side), relative to homes just across the border in special districts with low direct levies (the low tax side). The discontinuity in direct levies at district borders (empirically a difference of about $1274 per year in 2017 dollars) can help identify the effect of direct levies on home sale prices. The results are inconclusive, neither supporting full inattention nor full attention. The point estimates suggest that the higher annual cost of homes on the high tax side may not be fully passed through into home prices, as prices on the high tax side are lower by about $635 to $3409; however, the lower bounds on the 95% confidence intervals on these point estimates extend down to a price decline of about $11,785, which can, depending on assumptions about discount rates, be close to what would be expected with fully attentive buyers.==== These results are based on a number of restrictions to take seriously the issue of unobserved attributes, for example by only comparing homes in the same school attendance zone and homes that are in the same tax rate area (which influences access to some public goods).====Though buyers should in principle know about direct levies when thinking about what price to offer, one interpretation of the results is that buyers in practice lack information rather than attention. In response, the second setting studies how prices respond to homeowners’ association (HOA) fees in the San Francisco condominium market. (As noted above, this exposition is left mostly to the appendix.) HOA fees are ownership costs that are prominent, substantial, well-known to both buyers and sellers, and clearly disclosed to buyers. These features address the critique that incomplete information causes a muted price response to changes in ownership costs.==== Variation in HOA fees within homeowners’ associations helps identify the effect of these fees on sale prices. Each HOA has governing documents that stipulate the rules about how HOA fees are determined, and this can create variation in fees even within an association. For example, fees may vary based on the unit’s size (in square feet). Other possible, though much less common, factors include the unit’s location within the association, floor plan, or access to parking. Because the fees fund resources and amenities common to all residents within the association, the variation in HOA fees does not affect access to the services that the fees fund.==== Thus, higher fees represent higher costs without conferring extra benefits, so should be offset by lower prices. I introduce association-level fixed effects to control for time invariant unobservable characteristics common to all properties within a given association (including amenities funded by HOA fees) in order to identify the effect of fees on sale prices. Here too, the results support neither full sale price adjustment nor complete price insensitivity. Though the point estimates are suggestive of some inattention (with small and statistically insignificant increases ranging from $33 to $59), the point estimates lack enough precision to make strong conclusions.==== The wide confidence intervals are largely a consequence of employing association-by-year fixed effects to control for association-specific HOA fee trends, which soak up substantial HOA fee variation. This limitation of the data as they exist cannot be fully remedied, and thus prevents making strong conclusions.====Though I cannot conclusively reject complete price adjustment nor complete price insensitivity, not being able to decisively rule out price insensitivity in a high-stakes financial decision remains noteworthy. This leaves open the possibility that inattention, to some degree, may not be limited to small stakes purchases. Put another way, in high stakes decisions, inattention to large costs that are not explicitly included on price tags could indicate that consumers may not always choose to consider such costs. Inattention has the potential to affect market equilibria and dynamics by influencing whether and to what extent demand shifts in response to changes in costs. Thus, understanding the prevalence and determinants of incomplete price adjustments to costs can yield a better understanding of market dynamics and lead to more accurate predictions of how markets will adjust to changes in different types of costs.",Assessing evidence for inattention to the costs of homeownership,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105113772200033X,6 September 2022,2022,Research Article,32.0

The World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020, declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic. The early cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in the United States by January 2020. As of April 2021, there were more than 135 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 globally, with approximately 3 million related deaths. Approximately 20 percent of all confirmed cases and deaths related to COVID-19 were reported in the United States.====Several recent studies document the negative short-run impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the U.S. economy (====; ====; ====). This paper provides the first estimates of the short run impact of the state level policies to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus on various indicators of housing market activity in selected U.S. metropolitan areas.====During the early pandemic (2020), the majority of U.S. states implemented several policies to slow the spread of the COVID-19. Examples include shutting down certain businesses deemed non-essential, closing schools, ordering people to stay-at-home, and imposing restrictions on large gatherings. Early papers show that these policies were effective in slowing down the spread of the virus among the population (====) and reducing the movement and social interactions of individuals (====; ====; ====).====A first step towards understanding the short-run effects of these policies on U.S. economy requires a more detailed analysis of their effects on numerous areas of economic activity, including the housing market. To the best of my knowledge, no previous study has investigated the early short-run effects the state level policies to control the spread of the COVID-19 on housing market activity.

We find that the externality spills over to approximately 50 m and that one additional long-term vacant house within 50 m pushes property transaction prices down by approximately 3%. We argue that the externalities come at least partly from the disamenity channel, since they are not observed for vacancies that disappear within one or two years.

We also show that externalities exist only in areas where nearby long-term vacant houses are not yet common, as their existence stands out in those areas. These results imply that reducing the number of long-term vacant houses will help mitigate disamenities in areas that have not yet experienced severe declines.","The problem of vacant and abandoned properties has attracted wide attention because of their negative externalities for neighborhoods (Anenberg and Kung, 2014; Bak and Hewings, 2017; Bian et al., 2021; Daneshvary et al., 2011; Gerardi et al., 2015; Han, 2019; Harding et al., 2009; Hartley, 2014; Immergluck and Smith, 2006; Lin et al., 2009; Rogers and Winter, 2009; Schuetz et al., 2008; Wassmer, 2011; Whitaker and Fitzpatrick, 2013; Zhang and Leonard, 2014; Zhang et al., 2016). Public interventions for demolition and management programs to alleviate neighborhood distress are based on externalities (Paredes and Skidmore, 2017).====Most previous literature has studied the US context, and their interest has been limited to externalities of foreclosure related vacancies. These vacancies are the outcome of changes in owners’ economic situations and/or decisions, such as strategic defaults against the backdrop of an economic crisis. Foreclosures have long been a feature of the US property market but have been exacerbated by the experience of the Great Recession (from 2007 to 2009), when predatory lending practices resulted in huge additions to foreclosure inventories.====Abandonment and transfer of ownership are key factors in foreclosure externalities. First, it has been documented that externalities increase with the period of vacancy, from the foreclosure to the time until the next owner appears (Gerardi et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016). Complete neglect of properties from ownership abandonment leads to a severe increase in crime rates and cases of vandalism around them (Boessen and Chamberlain, 2017; Cui and Walsh, 2015; Lambie-Hanson, 2015; Spader et al., 2016).==== Neighborhood insecurity generates foreclosure externalities through the disamenity channel. Second, foreclosed properties are put on the market again at very low prices (Campbell et al., 2011; Hodge et al., 2017), and this extreme oversupply generates downward pressure in the submarket through the supply channel (Anenberg and Kung, 2014; Hartley, 2014).====In the US foreclosure context, negative externalities cannot be separated from foreclosure stigma. That is, the degree of negative externalities is larger for tax-delinquent or foreclosed properties than for properties simply in vacant status (Whitaker and Fitzpatrick, 2013). Since owners have an option to stop paying property taxes and abandon their ownership rights, severely neglected properties generating disamentiy externalities are those in tax-delinquent or foreclosed statuses (that is, not simply vacant). While transfer of ownership through tax-delinquency, foreclosure, and real estate owned (REO) sales increases supply in the market, vacancy status itself does not affect supply. These are publicly observed changes; thus, externalities also arise or disappear suddenly, even within a few weeks or months. Since it has been observed that the supply channel is more important than the disamenity channel (Anenberg and Kung, 2014; Hartley, 2014), it is likely that properties in a dilapidated state are foreclosed and placed on the market again.====The negative externalities potentially arise from “long-term vacant houses” that continue for several years; these vacancies are generally a low-demand phenomenon and not necessarily related to foreclosure events. To capture low demand in the US housing market, Molloy (2016) defined the long-term vacancies as units that are in roughly the top quartile of the distribution of the length of vacancy: six months or longer for units for rent, 12 months or longer for units for sale, and five years or longer for “other” vacant units. However, previous studies have only obtained an aggregated measure of long-term vacancies at the census tract level (Immergluck, 2016; Molloy, 2016; Wang and Immergluck, 2019). The difficulty in obtaining parcel-level microdata may be part of the background as to why the externalities of long-term vacancies have not been investigated in the US.====Most vacant houses that are becoming a problem in the Japanese society are long-term vacant houses.==== After the previous residents, who had already paid out the loans, moved out, the houses were left unoccupied due to structural backgrounds, such as the aging population.==== Since ownership of a vacant house continues, whereas the level of maintenance declines, the Japanese context enables us to capture the long-run impact of neglect, separate from the foreclosure stigma in the US context. The dilapidated long-term vacant houses are unlikely to be placed on the market again, because the foreclosure option is not as common as in the declining cities of US. Since the outcome of the neglect of maintenance gets publicly noticed a few years after the property becomes vacant, it is expected that the negative externalities from long-term vacant houses arise slowly over several years.====Employing parcel-level data on vacant houses in a depopulating city in the Tokyo metropolitan area, we provide evidence of the negative externalities of long-term vacant houses that persist for several years. We find that the externality spills over to approximately 50 m and that one additional long-term vacant house within 50 m pushes down property transaction prices by approximately 3%.

Here, we consider the impact of a public housing supply shock in a spatial equilibrium model and show that a larger local availability of houses can trigger industrialization by raising the number of residents. Also, the model suggests that this mechanism is stronger in places that exhibited, prior to the public housing plan, relatively higher population density. These implications are confirmed by the evidence we find from the INA-Casa plan, a program implemented by the Italian government in the aftermath of WWII.","The nexus between housing supply, urban dynamics and growth is crucial both in developed and in developing countries: see, e.g., Glaeser et al. (2006) for the US, Murray and Sun (2017) and Garriga et al. (2021) for China, and Accetturo et al. (2021) for Italy. As shown by Saks (2008), the way the local labour market responds to a productivity shock – which affects the demand for housing - substantially depends on the elasticity of housing supply. Differently from such contributions, which focus on local housing ==== shocks, this paper concentrates on local housing ==== shocks. By looking at the historical case of the Piano INA-Casa, a publicly supported programme implemented in Italy in the aftermath of WWII, we will argue that shocks to the local housing supply can have a substantial impact on urbanization and industrialization. This idea is consistent with other historical experiences in developing countries, such as the large public housing program that started in Singapore with the 1966 Land Acquisition Act (see Phang and Helble, 2016), or the Hong Kong's Public Housing Programme (1976-86) analyzed in Li and Yu (1990). Li and Yu (1990, p.108) suggest that public housing provision was crucial to industrialization since “tenants provided a large pool of low cost labour for Hong Kong's processing industries”. Moreover, public housing plans in less developed areas have advantages that go beyond the provision of mere dwelling space. By providing sanitation and sewers, such programs may substantially contribute to the health of the local population.====Differently from theories of structural transformation where wage differentials drive rural-urban migration====, our approach shows how an area starting with low population density may urbanize and experience industrial take-off following a policy-driven housing shock. The distribution of workers across areas is key to our approach. Since the adoption of technologies is largely driven by the local abundance of production factors (see, e.g., Acemoglu, 2002), we will argue that the industrialization of a certain area requires an adequate local supply of labour. Thus, differently from traditional sectors, manufacturing will go together with denser, urban, populations. Theoretically, such ideas can be readily represented as alterations in the factor shares of a Cobb-Douglas production function, after Seater (2005) and Accetturo et al. (2014).====In the model we propose there are two areas which are, initially, both devoted to the production of traditional (say, farming) goods. Then, an asymmetric housing supply shock occurs, favouring one area over the other. Some individuals will migrate to the “luckier” area to enjoy better housing services. If the increase in local population is sufficiently large, local entrepreneurs will have an incentive to quit traditional production and adopt technologies “directed” at exploiting the local abundance of labour. This area will thus switch from traditional sectors to sectors that are less land-intensive, such as manufacturing (see Gollin, 2002, p.463). In equilibrium, one area loses residents and remains stuck with traditional productions, while the other industrializes and urbanizes even further.====There is a number of contributions that offer theoretical explanations of urbanization. For example, Murata (2008) builds on non-homothetic preferences to generate a shift from agricultural to manufactured goods, produced under increasing returns to scale. The fall in transportation costs will eventually favour labour reallocation towards the non-agricultural, urban, sector. Michaels et al. (2012) analyze the dynamics of the transformation of rural areas into urbanized ones, by postulating that local productivity has sector-specific elements. Thus, certain areas have some specific comparative advantage in producing manufactured goods, reinforced by the presence of agglomeration externalities. Their model predicts increased dispersion in population density and, more important, a “U-shaped” relation between initial log-population density and local population growth. The finding of an “increasing relationship between population growth and initial population density at intermediate densities” (p.559) is quite similar to the implications of our model, where the implementation of manufacturing technologies requires a sufficient mass of workers.====Our model has also some affinities to Venables (2017), where the adoption of manufacturing requires a large labour supply, such to make urban wages sufficiently low. There, ==== substantial agglomeration externalities are assumed, the development of manufacturing will eventually be associated with ==== urban wages.==== Urbanization would thus generate an “urban wage-====”, rather than the commonly observed “urban wage-premium”: see Glaeser and Marè (2001). However, there is a large observed gap between labour compensation in agriculture and non-agriculture, as emphasized in Gollin et al. (2014) and Storesletten et al. (2019). To this regard, the adoption of the “share-altering hypothesis”, presented in Accetturo et al. (2014), has some advantages. This hypothesis implies that the switch to the labour-intensive technology will eventually increase the marginal productivity of labour itself, thus raising urban wages. As a result, our model can generate the urban-rural nominal wage premium even ==== postulating unmodeled agglomeration externalities that affect local Total Factor Productivity. The share-altering hypothesis puts particular emphasis on the conditions for the endogenous implementation of technologies, emphasizing the role of labour supply shocks on local industrialization. For instance, analyzing cross-county variation in migrations to the US over the period 1850-1920, Sequeira et al. (2020, p.404) find that “immigrants had an ==== positive effect on industrialization”. Similarly, Peters (2021) argues that forced relocations of German refugees in the aftermath of WWII had a positive impact on local manufacturing employment, while having a negative impact on the local agricultural employment share both in the short and the long run.====To test the main implications of the model, we use the historical case of a publicly supported housing program, implemented in Italy between 1949 and 1963: the Piano INA-Casa, also known as “Piano Fanfani”, after the Cristian-Democrat politician, Amintore Fanfani, who proposed it in the aftermath of WWII. This nationwide state-controlled residential development program -possibly inspired by the British “Beveridge Plan”- aimed at providing new good quality housing to working class people. A crucial feature of this plan is that its territorial distribution was uneven: see Di Biagi (2001). Some areas gained more than others, and this possibly twisted migration decisions and local labour market conditions. Here, we ask whether the INA-Casa plan has favoured urbanization and industrialization of certain rural areas by increasing local labour supply. The housing plan served several purposes, such as reducing unemployment as well as providing new and functional dwellings for the workers, so to “raise the standard of living of the working classes”.==== The general criteria required for the new buildings, and their distribution across the Italian territory, were decided by a national Committee with the support of INA (====, the National Insurance Institute, a public institution founded in 1912). The plan was implemented in two phases, 1949-56 and 1956-63. We focus on the former both because it is the one that most closely reflects the dynamics of rural-urban migration, which is the focus of the theoretical model, and because there are no data for the latter, at least at a sufficient level of geographic disaggregation for the empirical analysis. During its first phase, the ==== plan concerned 4,025 municipalities, out of a total number nearing 8,000.====Data on the development of the INA-Casa plan are, unfortunately, very scant. While our data report those municipalities which benefitted from the plan, we have no information on the number of residential units built at the local level (a measure of the intensity of the plan). Moreover, the availability of data for the period before WWII is severely constrained: consequently, pre-intervention similarity in trends between treated and controls can be only tested with population data. We adopt a selection-on-observables identification strategy and double-check our findings by using Oster (2019) to measure the likely bias for omitted variables. The empirical evidence we present is broadly consistent with the predictions of the model although, due to data limitations, is admittedly suggestive. We find that the housing plan stimulated the growth of the local population. By favoring larger population density, it also encouraged the local development of the manufacturing sector. In other words, we show that the treatment had considerable impact on local urbanization and industrialization in the post-war period. Further, we find that the impact of public housing was not homogeneous across initial population densities: treated municipalities that started with a higher level of ==== population exhibited a demographic and industrial growth that was relatively higher. Finally, we show that the process of industrialization was relatively more capital-intensive in larger municipalities: this finding may suggest that credit constraints were more stringent in smaller towns, possibly due to poorer collateral.====The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses the theoretical model and its implications. The historical background of post-war Italy and the plan INA-Casa is illustrated in Section 3. Section 4 presents the data, the empirical strategy, and the empirical results.

This paper uses national census tract-level data from 1990 to 2010 to estimate whether CRS participation affects housing development patterns. Our results show that participating in the CRS is associated with reduced rates of new housing construction and mobile homes in flood-prone areas. When we separate flood mitigation activities under the CRS program into information-based and regulation-based activities, we find that regulatory approaches are more effective than informational approaches. These results show a general pattern, nationwide and across decades, of community-scale flood management efforts deterring housing development in flood-prone areas.","Pressure to develop new housing, often in flood-prone areas, continues in the face of climate change and its impact of the likelihood, severity, and extent of natural disasters Kousky (2014). Flood risk largely operates at a scale larger than individual parcels, involving neighbors and other regional land use decisions to determine how flooding occurs and who it affects. Thus, community-scale efforts can play a prominent role in flood management, including shaping where new housing goes. How community-scale flood management activities affect new housing development, especially in flood-prone areas of the community, is a vital question for understanding effectiveness of current management approaches and future flood risk exposure.====To better understand the effectiveness of these community-scale flood management efforts, this paper analyzes the effects on housing development patterns arising from communities’ participating in national program aimed at encouraging local flood management across the country. We identify the effects of participation on net growth in new housing and in mobile homes for a panel of census tracts over three decades. Our analysis highlights effect heterogeneity depending on how risky the area is and depending on the nature of the management activities. Flood management's impacts on housing patterns may vary markedly for largely informational or regulatory approaches, for low-risk or high-risk areas, and for mobile homes or new housing.====This analysis yields insights that advance our understanding of local flood management practices and how housing markets respond. Prior work has tended to focus on which communities adopt management practices (e.g., Li and Landry, 2018; Sadiq and Noonan, 2015) or on outcomes of those practices, such as housing price effects (Muller and Hopkins, 2019), insurance take-up rates (Petrolia et al., 2013), damage estimates (Michel-Kerjan and Kousky, 2010, Frimpong et al., 2019), and population changes (Noonan and Liu, 2019). Little is known about how these community-scale efforts affect where new housing and mobile homes locate. Aside from new results about housing impacts, we also show how effectiveness varies by management approach – more mandatory and more informational – which can inform policy tool choices. These results can help guide policymakers seeking to deter ‘building underwater,’ and which approaches are more effective at steering housing development.====To estimate housing impacts, we estimate panel regression model using three decades of census tracts across the United States and detailed information about community flood management efforts. This approach employs time-consistent Census tract boundaries, high-resolution flood risk data, and program participation information for the Community Rating System (CRS) operated by Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). We use a difference-in-difference (DID) approach as our main estimation strategy. The DID results yield robust estimates of CRS participation impacts on housing development. Interacting the CRS treatment with variables detailing the local flood risk and each community's emphasis on regulatory or informational approaches to CRS allows us to differentiate effects by context. Suggestive evidence indicates that CRS participation does little to affect demolition of older, “grandfathered” buildings.====New homes and mobile homes are less common after community-scale flood management efforts. These effects are strongest where flood risk is greatest within the community and for jurisdictions that favor regulatory approaches over informational ones. These results show a general pattern, nationwide and across decades, of community-scale flood management efforts deterring or diverting housing development to higher ground. Stronger effects from regulatory, rather than information-based, approaches in high-risk areas holds important lessons for policy design. Better understanding how flood policy has shaped development patterns is vital in complex settings where regulations may restrict some development while other efforts may subsidize development in flood-prone areas or reduce information asymmetries that might have deterred development.====This analysis proceeds in the following manner. First, the literature review highlights the recent research on development and flood management. The background on the policy context describes the Community Rating System and how it might influence housing development. Next, the data and empirical approach section outlines the data used and how the modeling approaches capture the hypothesized effects of CRS participation. The empirical results section then presents the baseline model estimates and then the DID estimates, both for new housing construction and for mobile homes. Model extensions identify effect heterogeneity based on informational approaches and consider effects on older housing.

This study takes the analysis forward and examines whether children in better-educated cities perform better educationally than children in less educated cities and whether this relationship varies depending on parents’ educational attainment.====The share of the population with a college degree has increased substantially. In 1980, about 16% of people older than 25 had a bachelor's degree. This share reached 33% in 2019. During the same period, the high school non-completion rate declined from 34% to 10%. But it is still the case that children of parents with higher educational attainment are more likely to complete high school and receive a college education. Fig. 1 shows that a child's school enrollment and parents’ educational attainment are strongly correlated. About 56% of children ages 16 to 24 whose head of household did not complete high school were enrolled in school compared with 81% of children whose household head had a bachelor's degree.====Additionally, we find that school enrollment of children whose parents received less education are more sensitive to location. Specifically, children of less-educated parents in high-skill cities are more likely to be enrolled in school than those with parents with the same educational attainment but who live in cities where fewer people have college degrees. We do not observe this relationship for children of highly educated adults, who are likely to have sufficient internal resources to support their children's education. Fig. 2 presents school enrollment rates for 16-to-24-year-olds against city-level college graduate shares in four plots, each depicting this relationship within households heads’ educational attainment groups. The plots demonstrate how this relationship varies depending on the household head's educational attainment; although all children are more likely to stay in school in cities with high college graduate shares, the slope that shows the relationship between school enrollment and city skill level is much steeper for children of parents without a high school diploma. In appendix Figs. A1 and A2, we further divide our sample into two groups—children ages 16 to 18 and children ages 19 to 24—to examine whether we see similar trends in those who are in high school and those who are in college. Both figures show patterns similar to those in Fig. 1—the school enrollment of children of household heads who do not complete high school steeply increases with the MSA college graduate share compared with other groups.====Figs. A3., A4.====If high-skilled cities are indeed better places for education, especially for children raised in less-educated households, it makes Moretti (2013) and Ganong and Shoag (2017) findings—that we see a migration-induced divergence in skill levels across cities in recent decades—more concerning. If people with less educational attainment are being pushed out of high-skilled cities or have an entrance barrier to these places because of rising costs, there are potentially dire implications for their children in the years to come.====After including individual- and city-level control variables, we still find that children of high school dropouts in highly educated cities are more likely to be enrolled in school compared with the children of high school dropouts living in less educated cities with lower college graduate shares. Our ordinary least squares (OLS) results show that a 10 percentage-point increase in the city-level college graduate share is associated with a 1.5 percentage-point increase in the likelihood of children with parents who did not complete high school being enrolled in school. The locational association decreases with the parent's education level. In fact, we find that the school enrollment of children of parents who received more than a high school education does not show a statistically significant relationship with the college graduate share in the city where they live. This supports our hypothesis that location matters more for families with fewer within-family resources to support their children's education.====The OLS regression does not control for any time-varying city-level unobserved variables that can be associated with both the college graduate share and the child's likelihood of being enrolled in school. For example, a city's college graduate share is likely to be correlated with industrial structures and labor market conditions associated with local productivity shocks. These shocks can lead to different employment opportunities across cities that affect children's decisions to work or stay in school. Omitting the time-varying unobserved local factors is likely to cause a bias in our estimates. To address this issue, we directly control for local productivity shocks by using Bartik indexes and MSA-level individual industry shares.==== We find that including the Bartik indexes or the industry share does not change our results.====We also examine whether our results differ across time. Overall educational attainment in the US has improved, and the share of adults older than 25 without a high school diploma has dropped since 1980. This indicates that those who have the lowest educational attainment in 1980 may differ from those in the same category in 2019. Whereas in the early years of our study, the children of parents who did not complete high school were statistically more influenced by their city's educational attainment than high school graduates, we find that more recently, children of parents who did and did not graduate from high school are similarly influenced. In all years, the children of parents with college or more advanced degrees are less influenced by the educational attainment of their MSA.====Our study is related to studies that have found increasing skill divergence across US cities (Berry and Glaeser, 2005; Glaeser et al., 2004). Since the 1980s, cities with initially higher college graduate shares have attracted greater shares of adults with college degrees (Choi et al., 2020). Extant studies examined whether the education level of cities has a different impact on the wages and housing costs of individuals with different education levels and show mixed findings. For example, Moretti (2004) finds that wage increases are higher for people with less educational attainment in highly educated cities, while Berry and Glaeser (2005) find the opposite result. Choi et al. (2020) find similar results to Berry and Glaeser (2005) once the individual unobserved ability is controlled for and find that housing cost increases for less-educated workers completely offset the wage increases from living in highly educated cities. Our study adds to this literature by looking at how city-level educational attainment is related to child enrollment in school.====Our study is also related to studies that have examined whether educational attainment affects locational choices. Costa and Kahn (2000) find that college-educated couples increasingly live in large metropolitan areas because it is easier to be in these cities and pursue a dual career. Ganong and Shoag (2017) find high-cost cities have become less affordable, and individuals with less educational attainment have become less likely to move into these cities. On the other hand, Eeckhout et al. (2014) et al., find that skill distribution has thicker tails in large cities. This is because high-skilled workers demand low-skilled services that require less education, such as daycare or cleaning, which increases the employment opportunities of low-skilled workers and attracts them to these locations. We find that less-educated individuals are also more likely to have children in high-skilled cities. Although further research is needed to identify causality, it is possible workers with less educational attainment might be attracted to highly educated cities to give their children better educational opportunities.====Our findings indicate that location matters more for children with less-educated parents who have fewer family resources to support them. In recent years, home prices have increased significantly because of the lack of housing supply, especially in high-skilled cities (Choi et al., 2020). In the long run, low-skilled households would have to either make adjustments (e.g., work extra hours or change living arrangements) to stay in these cities or move to places with fewer educational opportunities for their children. This can have long-term negative consequences on intergenerational educational inequality.",The heterogeneous effects of interactions between parent's education and MSA level college share on children's school enrollment,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137722000171,10 May 2022,2022,Research Article,38.0

It extends the classical spatial equilibrium model of Rosen (1979) and Roback (1982) by explicitly modeling the dynamics of location-to-location migration flows that interact with the dynamics of housing depreciation and accumulation. The size and speed of spatial spill-over effects are quantified by means of spatiotemporal impulse response analyses of regional shocks. The proposed model is tractable and can be applied to study spill-over effects in regional housing markets, which have been the subject of a number of empirical studies by Holly et al., 2010, Bailey et al., 2016, Sinai, 2012, Cotter et al., 2015 and DeFusco et al. (2018), amongst others. The model can also be used to study the spatiotemporal impacts of changes in local land supplies on regional house prices and spatial population allocation, which have been recently considered by Hsieh and Moretti (2019) and Herkenhoff et al. (2018).==== Importantly, the model can be used to quantify the effects of factors such as migration elasticity, housing depreciation rate and local land supply conditions on the spatiotemporal adjustments in regional economies through migration, which cannot be done using Rosen–Roback style models that abstract from migration by assuming perfect mobility, or by using reduced form empirical models.====Specifically, we propose a spatiotemporal equilibrium model of the housing market by solving explicitly the agent’s optimal location choice problem and the dynamics of location-to-location migration flows. We model local labor and housing markets jointly with migration decisions, allowing the latter to be the function of wage and housing cost differentials. This is in contrast to conventional demographic studies on migration that use Markov chain models, such as Fuguitt (1965) and Tarver and Gurley (1965), but that assume transition probabilities across locations are exogenously given, whilst in our study we allow migration flows to interact with local housing markets through endogenous and nonlinear variations in transition probabilities across location pairs and over time. As a result, under our set-up local wage rates and house prices are jointly determined with migration flows. Our theoretical framework can be viewed as an example of a dynamic network where regional labor and housing markets interact with each other via migration flows that function as a source of spatial spill-over effects. The proposed model has the added advantage that it can be used for the analysis of spatial distribution of population, income and house prices, as well as for the analysis of the entire dynamic process of shock spill-over effects in regional economies through location-to-location migration.====We place location choice of individual agents at the core of our modeling strategy. At the start of each period, agents decide whether to remain where they are or migrate to a different location. The gain from migration depends on the differences in wage rates and housing costs between the origin and the destination, as well as migration costs consisting of a route-specific element plus a stochastic idiosyncratic component. The agent’s optimal location choice and the resultant migration process is shown to be Markovian with the transition probabilities across all location pairs given as non-linear functions of wage and housing cost differentials. In each location, construction firms build new houses by combining land and residential structures, with housing supplies endogenously responding to migration flows. In addition, it is shown that the deterministic version of the model has a unique balanced growth path, with non-zero population across all locations.====The model is estimated on a panel of ==== mainland U.S. states plus the District of Columbia on a training sub-sample, 1976–1999, and then evaluated over 2000–2014, which we refer to as the evaluation sample.==== The migration elasticity and route-specific migration costs, which are the key parameters affecting the spatiotemporal spill-over effects of regional shocks, are estimated ==== using the combined state-to-state migration flows and state level incomes and housing costs data. It is shown that a large part of variations in migration costs can be explained in terms of amenity differentials and geographical distances. Parameters that govern local housing supplies are calibrated using state level housing market data. We estimate the state level supplies of new residential land from the model using housing market and urban land acreage data. These estimates are shown to be significantly negatively correlated with the Wharton Residential Land Use Regulatory Index (WRI henceforth). In the baseline simulations, we examine the performance of the model in predicting the observed trends in house prices and migration flows over the evaluation sample. The model predicts the trends in state level house price-to-income ratios, output and population reasonably well. In addition, the model adequately captures the observed patterns of interstate migration flows.====To examine the size and speed of spatial spill-over effects, we compute spatiotemporal impulse responses of positive productivity and land-supply shocks to California, Texas and Florida in turn. A positive productivity shock in California raises local wages and induces net migration flows from other states to California, and causes population and house prices to decline in all U.S. states with the exception of California. However, the responses of population and house prices tend to be stronger and quicker for states close to California as compared to more distant states. Similarly, the responses of U.S. states to a positive land-supply shock in California also have qualitatively similar spatiotemporal patterns. These results suggest, perhaps not surprisingly, that migration between states that are geographically close are more responsive to changes in wages and housing costs differentials. This is largely due to the fact that migration costs tend to increase with migration distance.====We obtain qualitatively similar results for Texas and Florida. However, the responses of Texas and Florida to local shocks are quantitatively different from those of California, due to the differences in land supply conditions across these states. For example, a positive productivity shock in Texas (where housing supplies are more elastic) induces more inward migration flows and larger increases in housing stocks, while a positive productivity shock in California (where housing supplies are less elastic) translates into larger rises in house prices and less inward migration flows. In addition, a positive land-supply shock in California induces larger increases in housing supplies in California and more inward migration flows, while a positive land-supply shock in Texas has less impact on housing supplies in Texas and induces less inward migration flows. This is because new residential land is more scarce in California than in Texas, and thus a positive land-supply shock increases housing supplies more in California than in Texas.====Finally, we also investigate how the migration elasticity and the housing depreciation rate can affect the spatiotemporal adjustment processes. Not surprisingly, when migration elasticity is larger, a regional shock tends to induce more population reallocation, and the spill-over effects are stronger, especially for the nearby states. We find also that when the housing depreciation rate is low, housing stocks adjust slowly to changes in local housing demand and supply conditions, which slows down the migration flows (Glaeser and Gyourko, 2005).",A spatiotemporal equilibrium model of migration and housing interlinkages,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137722000146,30 April 2022,2022,Research Article,39.0

Sweden's Financial Supervisory Authority has introduced several borrower-based, macroprudential tools to control debt growth over the last ten years. In 2010, a mortgage loan-to-value (LTV) ratio was introduced, and in 2016, the amortization of 1 percent of the loan balance was mandated by law if a mortgage's value was higher than 50 percent of the property value. Furthermore, in 2018, the amortization requirement was tightened, as all households with a mortgage valued at larger than 4.5 times their annual income were forced to be amortized by 1 percent of the loan balance. The question is whether the Financial Supervisory Authority's macroprudential tools have exerted the intended effect. We combine a hedonic regression modeling approach with a ==== (RDD) to estimate the causal impact on house prices. The effect of these macroprudential tools is estimated on the single-family housing market and the condominium market. We are using microdata of one million housing transactions between 2008 and 2019. Our estimates indicate that the amortization requirement in 2016 resulted in a negative impact of around 7 percent on housing prices but that a slightly lower impact resulted from the 2018 amortization requirement. The 2010 LTV ratio requirement did not impact the prices of dwellings.","Since 2000, the ratio of household debt to disposable income increased from 100 percent to almost 200 percent in 2019. Fundamental factors such as income growth, the low cost of capital, a long mortgage maturity, and a reduction in income taxes, as well as lower property taxes, form the main forces behind the increasing house prices and household debt (Burgert et al., 2016). Household debt growth has made households vulnerable and highly interest-rate sensitive. In a recession, households may be forced to reduce their consumption, further depressing the crisis. Crowe et al. (2011) empirically show that countries with high household indebtedness are more inclined to have deeper economic recessions and weaker recoveries.====As a result, since 2010, Sweden's Financial Supervisory Authority introduced a series of measures to reduce interest rate sensitivity for households and increase overall financial stability. This macro-prudence has meant, among other things, higher capital requirements for bank and mortgage ceilings and amortization requirements for consumers. In 2010, a regulatory framework was introduced stating that household home loans should not exceed 85 percent of the housing value, hence, a loan‐to‐value (LTV) policy. In 2016, an amortization requirement was introduced for mortgage loans that exceeded 50 percent of the housing value, and the repayment requirement amounts were set at 1 percent of the loan each year. In 2018, this amortization requirement was strengthened by stipulating that households having a mortgage exceeding 450 percent of their gross income must repay an additional 1 percent of the mortgage loan each year, that is, a debt‐to‐income (DTI) policy. Sweden's Financial Supervisory Authority assesses that these measures have reduced debt and housing price levels by a total of approximately 14 percent and 5 percent, respectively, for financially restricted households (Andersson et al., 2018). Internationally, an increasing number of studies support the usefulness of household-based restrictions, such as LTV or DTI (see Hartman, 2015).====The overall purpose of the following analysis is to analyze whether Sweden's Financial Supervisory Authority's use of the three macro-prudential measures has exerted any effects on the Swedish housing market. The evaluation will be carried out on asset prices in the housing market and not on the housing loan stock. Moreover, the objectives of the analysis are to analyze the effects on different housing sub-markets. Analyses will determine whether the results differ between major metropolitan areas and small and medium-sized regions and whether the effects have been more prominent in the newly produced housing stock and the condominium housing segment than the single-family housing segment.====Over the last ten years, new regulations have been introduced in the mortgage market to reduce household indebtedness and increase financial stability. The primary hypothesis is that based on empirical findings, macroprudential measures have exerted the intended effect. That is to say, the housing market has been impacted, and house prices have been negatively affected. Moreover, we hypothesize that the effects have been more significant in housing markets where price levels are higher and in the smaller dwellings segment and that the impacts have been higher in segments of newly produced dwellings. Likewise, we hypothesize that the impact is more significant in the condominium segment compared to the single-family housing segment.====To test our hypotheses empirically, we have used data on housing transactions before and after the introduced macroprudential measures. Moreover, to control for the endogeneity problem, among other things, we have used a regression discontinuity design methodology. The results of our analysis of house prices indicate that LTV restriction did not affect prices, while the amortization requirements have exerted a significant impact on house prices. The estimates indicate that the negative price effect of the amortization requirement is approximately 8 percent, and the increased amortization requirement based on DTB has had a housing price effect of 4 percent. The condominium market has been more affected by the new requirements, which can be explained by the fact that there are more financially restricted households in this market than in the single-family household market.====The main contributions are (1) an evaluation of three different macroprudential policies over ten years using more than one million transactions on the housing market, (2) application of an evaluation methodology that has not been used, to our knowledge, in this context before, where the objective is to measure the causal impact of policies on house prices, and (3) a measurement of the effect on prices in different housing sub-market segments. Finally, (4) as lenders who issue mortgages to households that buy newly produced dwellings can deviate from the amortization requirements for up to five years, it increases the possibility of estimating causal effects.====Our purpose is different even if our analysis is of the Swedish housing market, and it uses the same macroprudential measures as Andersson (2018). Andersson analyzes new housing loans and whether financially restricted borrowers have borrowed less after the macroprudential measures than non-financially constrained households in a difference-in-difference framework. On the other hand, our analysis shows what housing-price impact the introduction of the macroprudential measures has had. Therefore, our study can be regarded as a complement to previous studies and not as a substitute. Our contribution is that by analyzing all housing transactions, another dimension to understanding macroprudential measures and their impact on the housing market has been added.====The structure of the paper is as follows: The following section is a review of some related literature to study the impact of macroprudential regulations. Section 3 examines macroprudential tools in Sweden during the period 2010–2018. Section 4 presents the theoretical framework. Section 5 presents the regression discontinuity design that has been used, and Section 6 shows the data used.

We establish a link between information about an applicant’s personality and her performance in the housing market. About 2,000 fictitious applications with randomly assigned German-, or Turkish-sounding, female or male names, with or without additional personality information were sent to vacant room ads. While the callback rate for German-sounding names is 52 percent, it drops to 37 percent for Turkish-sounding names. Female applicants receive significantly more callbacks than their male counterparts. Additional personality information is particularly beneficial to the group with the highest callback rate (German females) and the group with the lowest callback rate (Turkish males). Thus, personality information reduce the ethnic gap between Turkish and German males, whereas the gap among females increases. A simple theoretical model shows that the strong effect of information on German females can be explained by aggregation over rooms that differ in market tightness. Moreover, advertisers who only accept applications of one particular gender discriminate significantly more against Turkish applicants.","Affording rent for an own apartment in a big city can be an enormous challenge. Especially for young professionals and students who face significant economic constraints due to costly tertiary education, finding an affordable place to stay is often impossible (Clark et al., 2018b). In addition, the increase in urban population, declining marriage rates, increasing mobility combined with a low supply of central and affordable housing have led to fierce competition in urban housing markets (Lehrer, 2008, Harrison et al., 2006, Clark and Tuffin, 2015, Federal Statistical Office, 2018a).====As a result, the number of shared households has increased in recent years in many European countries, the United States, Australia, and even China (Ahrentzen, 2003, McNamara and Connell, 2007, Clark et al., 2018b, Federal Statistical Office, 2018b, Nasreen and Ruming, 2018). Sharing an apartment is most common in large cities and densely populated regions with tight real estate markets. In the 15 largest metropolitan areas in the United States, the number of shared apartments increased by more than seven percent between 2015 and 2017 alone (United States Census Bureau, 2019).====In Germany, living in shared accommodation is the most popular form of living among students and increased by approximately 20 percent between 2014 and 2018 (Federal Statistical Office, 2018b). Sharing an apartment as a non-family household is widespread among childless young adults. Typically, this involves sharing common areas, such as the kitchen and bathroom. Unlike student dorms in the U.S. and some other countries, each resident almost always has her own bedroom (Clark et al., 2018b). Nevertheless, the other tenants in the same household are referred to as “roommates”.====Unfortunately, research on discrimination in shared housing markets is rather limited (Carlsson and Eriksson, 2015, Sawert, 2019). While previous studies on discrimination in shared and regular rental housing markets focus primarily on the effects of ethnicity (Carpusor and Loges, 2006, Hanson and Hawley, 2011, Carlsson and Eriksson, 2015, Ahmed and Hammarstedt, 2008, Sawert, 2019, Hanson and Santas, 2014, Auspurg et al., 2019), gender (Ahmed and Hammarstedt, 2008, Baldini and Federici, 2011, Bengtsson et al., 2012), and additional occupation information (Auspurg et al., 2017, Ahmed et al., 2010, Carlsson and Eriksson, 2015, Andersson et al., 2012), there are few that combine all three (Carlsson and Eriksson, 2014, Ewens et al., 2014, Andersson et al., 2012, Bosch et al., 2010). Field experiments investigating the role of information other than occupation or economic status, such as leisure activities, smoking behavior, or information about character traits, are even rarer and, moreover, inconclusive (Carlsson and Eriksson, 2014, Ewens et al., 2014).====To date, there is no study in the housing market that examines the effect of self-reported ==== information on the callback probability conditional on gender and ethnicity. This study fills this research gap by conducting a field experiment in the market for shared housing in Germany.====Our contribution in this paper is threefold: Firstly, this study is the first to primarily use personality information about an applicant’s character traits, providing causal results on the effect of ethnic and gender discrimination and additional self-reported personality information that allows inferences about an applicant’s character traits, such as being spontaneous and sociable as signals of agreeableness and conscientiousness (Clark et al., 2018a). Secondly, we develop a simple theoretical model to simulate the interacting effects of personality information, gender, and ethnicity on the callback probability and derive testable hypotheses. Thirdly, we empirically study the effect of personality information in the shared housing market, a segment of the housing market in which personality information is particularly relevant, as housing suppliers and tenants are expected to interact repeatedly on a daily basis, which has important implications for market segregation and stratification.====The shared housing==== market has several advantages for studying the interacting effects of ethnicity, gender, and the role of personality information. While in regular rental housing markets, reliable rent payments might be the landlord’s biggest concern (Horr et al., 2018), in the context of shared housing there might be additional important concerns, such as cleanliness, cooperation and thoughtfulness (Clark et al., 2018a) since co-tenants typically interact with each other in their private daily lives.====In cities and metropolitan areas, shared housing may be the only viable option for young people with limited resources. While large commercial landlords are not allowed to discriminate under German law, private landlords who supply a small number of rented dwellings (e.g., roommates in a shared apartment) are not subject to the General Act on Equal Treatment (Antidiskriminierungsstelle des Bundes, 2013).==== Some ads for vacant rooms even state that only applications from potential roommates of a certain gender, i.e. either only male or only female applicants, will be considered. While this gender restriction appears to be socially acceptable, a similar overt exclusion of applicants of a particular ethnicity cannot be observed. This suggests that discrimination in this largely unregulated housing market can further impede the integration of young immigrants into society.====We develop and simulate a simple theoretical model to illustrate the interaction of ethnic, gender, and informational discrimination that are observed during the application process for vacant rooms. The model allows us to derive hypotheses that are tested in the field study. Moreover, the model shows that aggregating available rooms with different levels of housing market tightness can explain why not only the group with the lowest callback rates (Turkish males) but also the group with the highest callback rates (German females) are strongly affected by personality information.====For the correspondence study, we send out more than 2000 online applications for vacant rooms in eight German cities. By randomly assigning either a common German- or Turkish-sounding male or female name to the applications, the differences in callback rates reveal substantial ethnic and gender discrimination in the German market for shared housing.====The results show that Turkish male applicants without additional personality information have the lowest callback rate (29 percent). On the other hand, German female applicants who include additional personality information receive the most callbacks (59 percent). However, this “best-performing” group suffer the most from providing less information (−10 percentage points), which was not found in previous studies.====In contrast, applications with Turkish female names do not have significantly higher callback rates when the application contains additional information, whereas Turkish male names perform significantly better in this regard with respect to invitations to viewings. Furthermore, in contrast to previous studies, the ethnic gap for female applicants increases to a large extent when the application text includes additional personality information, whereas this gap narrows for male applicants. We also find evidence that advertisers who allow either female-only or male-only applicants are significantly more likely to discriminate against the ethnic minority.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a brief review of related literature. The following Section 3 provides the theoretical model and its simulation. Subsequently, the methodology and experimental setup are described in Section 4.

Therefore, we analyze if macroeconomic shocks are homogeneous across the metropolis and check for the presence of ripple effects. For this purpose, we implement a panel vector ==== to macroeconomic shocks across submarkets. Finally, we notice the presence of ripple effects in all submarkets with different ==== at play.","Since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), a growing literature has been devoted to the analysis of asset price fluctuations, especially housing prices, and their impacts on business cycle dynamics. Here, we focus on the reverse link. We analyze the consequences of macroeconomic shocks on housing markets. Because the housing sector is influenced by macroeconomic policies and is subject to structural breaks and market imperfections, modeling house prices is obviously a challenge. These variations may have short- and long-term effects. Therefore, we use macroeconomic structural variables, such as demographic changes and vacancy rates, and cyclical variables, such as mortgage rates, inflation rates, income, and construction. The understanding of macroeconomic shocks and spillover effects across submarkets is fundamental for all the actors in the real estate sector, as well as policymakers. For instance, this point is important for real estate investors to define their investment strategies and diversify their portfolios. For real estate developers, it is useful for targeting locations and future hotspots and ensuring the liquidity and viability of their housing developments. Furthermore, policymakers are likely to be more involved in the housing market if they know the consequences of these shocks and their propagation effects from a neighbor city. A good understanding of the shocks’ effects would enable policymakers to anticipate and to design affordable housing policies to protect low-income households from increases in house prices.====To shed new light on the effects of macroeconomic shocks and spillover effects across the housing submarkets, we have chosen the Greater Paris Metropolis. Including Paris, its neighboring three departments (or “petite couronne”) and a few bordering cities in the departments beyond, the Greater Paris Metropolis presents a metropolitan area with administrative subdivisions (cities) exhibiting sharp differences in demographics, income, and wealth. These contrasted economic and hedonic characteristics explain the existence of submarkets and may explain why a hypothetical spatial arbitrage would not lead to price equalization across submarkets. As reported by Bourassa et al. (1999) (among others), dwellings are indeed poor substitutes in other submarkets.====In this article, we propose an investigation of housing submarkets to study the relative integration of the Greater Paris housing market. Likewise, we analyze the boom and bust cycles in the housing market during the period 1996–2019. Finally, we examine the spatial and temporal diffusion of macroeconomic shocks on house prices, with a particular focus on the presence of ripple effects. Therefore, we use a spatial panel vector autoregressive (SpVAR) approach and conventional impulse response functions that cover the period from 2006 to 2017.====The spatial dimension allows an understanding of the contagion effect between submarkets or cities. Furthermore, the presence of ripple effects explains, in part, why housing markets are not fully efficient. These ripple effects are not instantaneously integrated but spread out with certain delays.==== Actually, the presence of a spatial effect tends to increase market dynamics that do not rely only on local factors, a phenomenon Meen (1999) explained well. A ripple effect is produced by structural differences between submarkets, inducing effects on housing demands and other house price fundamentals. Meen (1999) suggests four different explanations for the ripple effect: migration, equity conversion, spatial arbitrage, and exogenous shocks with different timing for spatial effects. Housing submarkets do not rely only on local factors. Trends in house prices and the presence of a spatial effect tend to trigger self-fulfilling expectations and, thus, the occurrence of boom-and-bust cycles.====The approach, in terms of housing submarkets, is particularly useful because it unveils relevant information for the analysis of house price dynamics that are not seeable at an aggregate, national, regional or metropolis level as a whole. In doing so, it enables investors, developers, credit institutions, households, and policymakers to anticipate and make informed decisions.====Our research fills the gap. Our results report that the housing market in the Greater Paris Metropolis is not integrated and cannot be seen as homogeneous. In fact, we show the existence of six housing submarkets by implementing principal component and clustering analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that macroeconomic shocks have heterogeneous effects on house prices across submarkets. Likewise, the integration of the spatial dimension provides evidence of ripple effects in the metropolis, but the effects are not present in all submarkets.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 develops the literature review on defining housing submarkets and the effects of macroeconomic shocks on house prices. Section 3 presents the empirical strategy and theoretical framework for macroeconomic shocks and ripple effects. Section 4 introduces the data and considers the housing cycles. Section 5 describes housing submarkets.

In contrast to the instrument choice literature in environmental economics, urban economics and planning studies seldom analyze these types of instruments together. We analyze these instruments in a general equilibrium spatial model with spatial heterogeneity. We examine their working mechanisms and efficiencies and extend the instrument choice approach to the externalities caused by infrastructure congestion. When the instrument design is optimal, zoning can be more efficient than, as efficient as, or less efficient than, congestion charges, depending on the relative strength of road and nonroad congestion. However, when, for whatever reason, there are deviations from the optimal instrument level, zoning not only becomes inferior to congestion charges, but is also likely to reduce welfare.","There has been a long-standing debate among economists on the relative efficiency of price and quantity regulation instruments to control market failures such as externalities. Examples include Weitzman (1974) and Kaplow and Shavell (2002) on pollution control in environmental economics. We focus on this topic in a spatial economy and compare the efficiency of tax instruments (property taxes and congestion charges) and zoning (floor area ratio regulations and land-use type regulations) as policy instruments to control the simultaneous congestion of road and nonroad infrastructure. We ask three questions. First, how might the optimal policies differ when metro areas are endowed with unique features that are not fully captured by the standard deterministic spatial models? Second, how does the welfare verdict change when optimal instruments are not known a priori? Third, how might the policy instruments be designed when relieving one type of congestion is accompanied by aggravating another type of congestion?====We consider two types of infrastructure: (1) road or non-local infrastructure that links two points in a space and thus enables movement between locations, and (2) nonroad or local infrastructure that provides local public services such as fire and police stations, schools, and parks, and is mainly linked to places of residence or production. Controlling one type of congestion at one location can spill over into congestion of other infrastructures at other locations. The spatial interdependence of congestion control between different types of infrastructure complicates its job. In the following, zoning refers to the regulation of floor area ratios (FARs) and land use types in built-up areas; we do not consider urban growth boundaries and greenbelts.====Having characterized the issues at hand, we look at the literature showing that tax and regulation instruments may be closely linked. Property tax is a tax price paid by residents for local public services, in particular, road and nonroad infrastructure, and zoning is a physical mechanism forcing residents to consume “at least some minimum amount of housing” that is taxed for the cost of local public service provision (Hamilton, 1975: 206). Because each additional resident entails additional costs of public service provision, property tax is an efficient congestion charge that is indispensable when a non-distortionary head tax is unavailable (Hoyt, 1991; Krelove, 1993). Similarly, lot-size zoning is equivalent to a congestion charge via its effect on density (Wheaton, 1998).====Concerning the relationship between zoning and taxes, theoretical studies by urban economists have found that zoning is first-best (Pines and Sadka, 1985; Wheaton, 1998), almost as efficient as the first-best policy mix (Rhee et al., 2014); second-best (Pines and Sadka, 1985; Kono et al., 2012); or only third-best (Pines and Kono, 2012). In contrast, authors driven mainly by empirical studies state that the cost of land use regulations (LURs) is huge (Cheshire and Sheppard, 2002; Bertaud and Brueckner, 2005). Specifically, urban growth boundaries (UGB) are thought to improve welfare negligibly at most (Brueckner, 2007) or even be absolutely harmful (Anas and Rhee, 2006). In some cases, an expansionary growth boundary is recommended instead (Anas and Rhee, 2007; Anas and Pines, 2008).====These treatments contrast with the planning literature for compact development, where controls are required to “grow smart” (Ewing et al., 2007). To control metropolitan-wide transportation externalities, however, the authors recommend various combinations of congestion charges and/or LURs (refer to Takeda et al., 2019 for a reference); a mobility plan rather than a single anti-congestion measure (Guzman et al., 2020); and a comprehensive set of transportation, industrial, and development schemes (OECD, 2012). To the best of our knowledge, however, there are no studies that simultaneously consider both types of congestion.====Sometimes, the recommendations are conflicting. For example, a higher density is advised at the city center to fight traffic congestion (Kono et al., 2012). On the contrary, however, lower density is advised at the city center to lower negative “population externalities”. We resolve this complication by reformulating the problem using a generalized setup. We analyze various zoning (or equivalent land-use regulation) issues using a significantly extended model that resembles the real world, but is not yet specified in that context. These extensions include a general equilibrium non-monocentric model, two types of congestion, a basket of different regulatory instruments, mixed land use for production and residences, and spatial heterogeneity.====We derive the first-order formulas for the welfare change associated with various policies (taxes and zoning). The formulas reveal the fundamental differences between the models with and without spatial heterogeneity and between taxes and zoning. First, we find that some confusion and complications in urban and transportation economics are attributable to covariance terms of the Feldstein (1972) type that capture the distributional effect of the policy administered. One finding is that the standard policy prescription of Pigouvian congestion pricing is not guaranteed to be first-best in the spatial model with spatial heterogeneity. We can precisely measure the size of the covariance terms, because we have explicit formulas for the welfare change.====Second, the political economic approach to zoning helps explain real-world inefficiencies. The results may be intended outcomes chosen by private and public parties, or may be the unintended outcome of imperfect planning processes. Some may come from the specific preferences of planners for zoning policy (see above literature). This might be an issue, particularly in countries such as China, the UK, and Korea, where planners play a major role in the zoning process (Cheshire and Sheppard, 2002; Cai et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2017 , ). This leads to one of our research questions: How robust are the efficiency results of pricing and physical instruments when the instruments are not chosen to be optimal? In the real world, optimal zoning is far from obvious. A practice lawyer once confessed that he sees zoning with an “admiration that the confusion that characterizes zoning thrives in the same culture in which the myth flourishes so abundantly” (Babcock, 1966: 16).====Because LURs are a type of quantity regulation, we can readily recast the efficiency issues within the instrument choice framework of environmental economics. However, unlike the existing instrument choice literature, we treat the externalities present in public facilities of infrastructure rather than those individual, private facilities, and introduce imprecision into the policies themselves rather than into the costs and benefits of pollution abatement. This analytical twist is useful to evaluate any type of policy deviation from optimal policies; the uncertainties of the individual costs and benefits of pollution abatement are a special case of our approach.====Our numerical simulations show that when optimal policies (first- and second-best policies) are known, zoning is less efficient than, as efficient as, or more efficient than, tax instruments, depending on the population size of a metro area. This adds to the literature because our result that Pigouvian pricing could be even less efficient than zoning has not yet been reported. At the same time, once we allow for deviations from the optimal instrument designs, such as imprecise zoning and taxation, the welfare loss of imprecise zoning is so large that tax instruments are not only more efficient, but also safer to use than zoning.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows Section 2. presents an intuitive analytical model highlighting the differences between the two types of instruments in dealing with traffic congestion. In addition, we examine the working mechanisms of the first- and second-best instruments in the model with spatial heterogeneity. In Section 3, we generalize the model in which road and nonroad infrastructure externalities are modeled together, various input and output markets are present, land use is mixed, and cross-commuting is incorporated. Using this model, we conduct numerical simulations, compare the efficiencies of pricing and zoning instruments, and explore the consequences of deviations from optimal policies when the optimal policies are not known Section 4. concludes.",Regulation versus taxation: Efficiency of zoning and tax instruments as anti-congestion policies,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137722000122,27 February 2022,2022,Research Article,43.0

To calculate the total value of home improvement, we apply a household production model where households can either purchase professional services or combine market goods with their time. We find that household production is a significant source of home investment. Failing to account for the ==== provided by household members greatly understates the total allocation of resources to home improvement. Consistent with standard household models, home production is a substitute for market-purchased services—labor supply is negatively related to the former and positively related to the latter.","Home equity accounts for a significant share of net household wealth (Eggleston et al., 2020), particularly for low- and middle-income Americans. One way that households can increase home equity is by improving the underlying asset, e.g., renovating a room or replacing aging infrastructure.==== Conversely, equity may erode if such improvements fail to keep pace with physical depreciation. The importance of home improvement is reflected in the nearly $300billion spent by American households in 2017, approximately 1.5% of US GDP (Joint Center for Housing Studies, 2019).====In this article, we investigate how older Americans allocate their resources to home improvements using the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS), drawing on the household production framework introduced by Becker (1965). Because homeowners can make improvements by purchasing professional services or by combining their time with market goods, the latter which we refer to as ==== (DIY), the household production framework will more accurately capture the total investment in home improvement than previous studies that have only considered household expenditure patterns (Begley and Lambie-Hanson, 2015, Davidoff, 2006, Fisher and Williams, 2011, Gyourko and Tracy, 2006, Haughwout et al., 2013).====Accounting for the value of time allocated to improvements is especially important for this group of homeowners as retirement significantly changes the marginal value of time. Indeed, studies of consumption and investment decisions that use expenditure in lieu of consumption can generate conclusions that are incomplete or even misleading. For example, the so-called ==== identified a decline in food expenditures in retirement (Hamermesh, 1984, Banks et al., 1998, Bernheim et al., 2001, Hurd and Rohwedder, 2008), a seeming contradiction to the Permanent Income Hypothesis. Subsequent work that approached the issue from the household production framework revealed that this puzzle was almost entirely illusory: households do smooth consumption by substituting away from goods-intensive production toward more time-intensive production methods after retirement. While expenditure falls at retirement, the increase in time allocated to shopping and meal preparation allows households to maintain their pre-retirement consumption levels (Aguiar and Hurst, 2005, Atalay et al., 2020, Been et al., 2020, Hurst, 2007, Schwerdt, 2005, Stancanelli and Van Soest, 2012, Velarde and Herrmann, 2014). To our knowledge, ours is the first study to examine whether similar reallocations of time and monetary resources occur with respect to home improvement.====Unlike food, the canonical non-durable commodity in studies of life-cycle spending, housing is durable. Thus, smoothing of investment or consumption may not be optimal over the life-cycle or even over the post-retirement period. Allocations of time and money to home improvement increase the consumption flow from housing both contemporaneously and in the future. Within a given time unit, retirement increases the opportunity to receive these flows as individuals spend more time at home. We would thus expect overall investment in home improvement to increase around retirement in anticipation of higher total consumption returns per period. On the other hand, as individual’s age, the expected number of remaining future periods falls. This would tend to cause households to decrease their home improvement activities.====In addition, some of the activities that generate the largest consumption flows from housing may become less salient as households age. Fewer guests may spend the evening, reducing the utility of extra bedrooms or bathrooms. Dinner parties may be less frequent, reducing the utility of formal dining areas or contemporary kitchen appliances. These factors would also tend to reduce household allocations to home improvements, anticipating lower future consumption flows.====At the same time that the consumption flow from housing may be falling, the marginal productivity of time and money allocated to DIY likely also declines. Specifically, as individuals age, we expect deteriorating health to reduce the types of home improvement activities that individuals can undertake and the speed with which tasks are completed. This process would tend to decrease both the total value of home improvements, as well as the share of home improvement value accounted for by DIY.====Although existing studies find that retired households tend to spend $900-$1400 per year less than working-age households on home improvements (Begley and Lambie-Hanson, 2015, Davidoff, 2006, Fisher and Williams, 2011, Gyourko and Tracy, 2006, Haughwout et al., 2013), these estimates are incomplete for two reasons. First, a decrease in home improvement expenditure in retirement may be offset by increased time allocations. This would tend to offset the fall in expenditure. If the converse is true and older households are allotting less time to housing maintenance while simultaneously reducing their expenditure, then the previous studies under report the true value of disinvestment in the house.====Second, conditional on reaching age 65, the modal retirement age for Americans, more than 50% of males will reach age 83. Among females who reach age 65, more than half will reach age 86 and more than a quarter will live past their 92nd birthday. Simple means between working-age and retirement-age populations may obscure important patterns within the age-profile of home improvement allocations among older American homeowners. Documenting how household allocations to home improvement activities evolve as households age controlling for the health status of household members is thus a second important contribution of the subsequent analysis.====There are three key results that we present in this manuscript. First, household production is as important as expenditure on professional services when it comes to home improvement. Failing to account for the value of household production will vastly understate the total value of home improvement. Second, home improvement allocations exhibit an inverted U-shape over the last third of the life-cycle, increasing before and just after retirement and then decreasing. The frontloading of home improvement is consistent with retirees anticipating that they will remain in their current residence throughout most of their retirement, which we discussed earlier. Third, household production and market-purchased services for home improvement are substitutes—as labor supply decreases households shift toward the former from the latter. Nevertheless, this appears to be secondary to income and health effects that generate a common inverted-U age profile in both.","Household production, home improvement, and housing investment among older Americans",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137722000110,26 February 2022,2022,Research Article,44.0

As a consequence, prices are sluggish to adjust downward, time to sale becomes longer, ask and transaction prices differ.====We document loss aversion for the Italian real estate market and complement the existing literature along two dimensions: (i) we test for loss aversion using homeowners’ evaluations of their houses, rather than ask or final prices, as customary in the literature; (ii) we document variation across household characteristics in the degree of loss aversion.====We find that homeowners subject to estimated losses stick to the price at which they purchased and do not revise their assessment in response to downward market conditions, whereas the evaluation of those expecting a gain is independent of previous sale prices. Although there is a strong case for loss aversion in our sample, we document some variation across demographic groups: poorer, younger and less educated households show more reference dependence than the average one.","The hypothesis of downward price rigidity in housing markets is corroborated by several stylized facts. Prices and transactions are usually correlated over the economic cycle, which is at odds to what is predicted by standard asset theory. During market downturns, housing units take longer to be sold, while the gap between ask prices and transaction prices widens.====What could be behind such price rigidity? Preferences characterized by loss aversion are one possible explanation (Genesove and Mayer, 2001). Homeowners’ decision to sell may not be the assessment of the current opportunity cost, but also depends on the difference between current market price and previous buying price. Since during downturns the market value of many houses is often way below the price paid for by the current owners, these latter would incur a loss if they sold their house at market prices. Owners who are loss-averse have therefore an incentive to reduce this expected loss by setting a reservation price that exceeds the current value of the unit and is closer to the price they have paid (the so-called price dependence). Ceteris paribus, they set asking prices higher than market prices, and are less likely to match a potential buyer in the market. As a consequence, the number of transactions decreases, time to sale gets longer, and the asking-final price spread gets larger.====In this paper, using data on a sample of Italian households, we test whether, conditional on both observable and unobservable housing characteristics, homeowners keep the evaluation of their main dwelling according to the price at which they bought it, regardless of current market conditions. To rule out spurious correlation due to unobserved housing characteristics, we condition out latent quality by controlling for the difference between sale price and estimated price based on observed characteristics at the time of sale.====We find that homeowners subject to estimated losses almost do not adjust their assessment in response to downward market conditions, while their evaluation is independent of the previous sale price in case of expected gain. We document some heterogeneity in loss aversion according to observable characteristics of the household: while loss aversion is mildly stronger among poorer, younger, and less educated households, there is a strong case for loss aversion across all demographic characteristics we accounted for.====Our findings add to the strand of empirical literature on loss aversion in housing markets which, up until now, has documented its effect on asking or transaction prices. Apart from extending the evidence to the Italian housing market, this paper innovates by focusing on survey data on owned housing units appraisal, before any choice to put or not the asset on the market. That provides a threefold contribution to the literature. First, it shows the extent to which loss aversion is rooted in an ex-ante cognitive distortion and before the owner might be influenced by the real estate agent’s valuation (which would reflect in the ask price) or by the match with the demand in the real estate market (which would reflect in the transaction prices). Second, it identifies the effect of loss aversion, ruling out any bias given by the endogenous choice to put the housing unit in the market or by concavity in housing demand. Third, the use of survey data allows documenting heterogeneity in loss aversion among households by exploring its interplay with demographic characteristics. Our rich database allows us to distinguish very precisely which household characteristics are more related with loss aversion. For instance, we show that the correlation between anchoring to previous sale price and a large loan to value ratio disappears when the overall household wealth is controlled for.====The existence of downward housing price rigidity we document in this paper has relevant implications for policy debate, mainly because it amplifies the effects of negative economic shocks: loss aversion has important implications on the understanding of housing market dynamics, as it explains transaction freeze during downturns. Our focus on household evaluation is also important along two different policy relevant dimensions. First, estimates of real wealth based on survey data on household wealth would be systematically upward biased during market downturns, since our results imply that householders in expected loss overvaluate their real assets. Second, along the business cycle, the consumption and saving decisions might be asymmetrically influenced by the incorrect valuation of housing wealth by the households (Agarwal, 2007).",Loss aversion in housing appraisal: Evidence from Italian homeowners,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105113772200002X,12 February 2022,2022,Research Article,45.0

In 1974, the NAACP sued Fulton County, Georgia – the principal county of the Atlanta metro area – over this very issue. In 1991, a mass reappraisal intended to remedy this discrimination incited a tax revolt in Fulton. However, there are few recent studies of whether discrimination is still taking place. Using assessment data from Fulton County 2010-2016, I find little to no evidence of any racial or socioeconomic discrimination in ratios of property assessment to sale prices. This suggests that (1) the assessment process is uniform and non-discriminatory, and/or (2) the process and fee for appealing one's assessment is not inaccessible to a degree that would allow any disparities to persist, and/or (3) regression-based mass appraisal techniques are capable of eliminating racial discrimination from property assessment.","Economic research has revealed a variety of ways in which members of racial minorities are disadvantaged in housing markets. Perry ==== (2018) find that in a sample of U.S. metropolitan areas, homes in neighborhoods with more than 50% black population sell at half the price of similar homes in neighborhoods with no black residents, controlling for other neighborhood characteristics. Others find that black individuals pay higher prices than whites for identical houses within the same neighborhoods (Bayer ==== 2017, Ihlanfeldt and Mayock 2009, Myers 2004).==== Audit and correspondence studies consistently find that landlords respond more positively to emails when the potential renter has a “white” name rather than a “black” or “Arab” name (Öblom and Antfolk 2017, Ewens ==== 2014, Hanson and Hawley 2011, Carpusor and Loges 2006). Minority owners list lower rental prices on Airbnb (Edelman and Luca 2014, Wang ==== 2015, Kakar ==== 2018, Marchenko 2019) and minority guests are less likely to be accepted by Airbnb hosts (Edelman ==== 2017). However, the difference becomes statistically indistinguishable when the guest has at least one review, suggesting the discrimination is statistical, not taste-based (Cui ====. 2016).====Researchers have also shed light on ==== forms of property tax discrimination, especially by location and price range (Pearson 1979, Holmes and Pinner 1975, Engle 1975, Haettenschwiller 1973, Little 1973, Oldman and Aaron 1965, Townsend 1951). Faulk and Hicks (2015) – studying the entire state of Indiana over the period 2005-2012 – find that low-valued properties are over-assessed while high-valued properties are under-assessed. They also find that non-homestead properties – which are more likely to be rental properties or second homes – are over-assessed relative to homestead properties. McMillen and Singh (2019) – studying Baltimore, Cleveland, Denver, and Philadelphia – find that property taxes are regressive with respect to both sale price and income. Finally, the ongoing Property Tax Fairness project by the Center for Municipal Finance at the University of Chicago, using county-level data for nearly the entire United States, finds evidence that sale price regressivity is pervasive.====However, there has been surprisingly little economic research investigating whether the property tax suffers from ==== discrimination. What little research exists on this subject has been published mostly in the fields of law, public policy, history, and urban studies (Atuahene 2018; Atuahene and Hodge 2018; Kahrl 2018, 2016; Connor 2018; Rothstein 2017: 169-172; Capps 2015; Lee 2004; Lyons 1982; Baar 1981; Bremer ==== 1979).==== Only a few publications on this subject exist in economics (Black 1972, Hendon 1968). The aim of this paper is to update the economic study of racial discrimination as it affects the property tax.====What these last-named studies have found is that some local governments have taxed properties in predominately black and/or low-income neighborhoods at higher real rates than properties in predominately white and/or high-income neighborhoods. Black and/or low-income residents would be taxed at the same nominal property tax rate as white and/or high-income residents, but property values in the former neighborhoods would be over-assessed. For example, in Fort Worth, Hendon (1968, table 3) found that assessment ratios – i.e. the ratios of assessed value to sale price – were between 0.93 and 1.03 for blacks but between 0.49 and 0.74 for whites. In Boston in 1960, Black (1972, table 2) found that homes in the neighborhoods with the greatest non-white percentage were assessed at a ratio of 0.64 while the rest of the city was assessed at a ratio of 0.37. In New Haven, Lee (2004, table 6) found that single-family homes in majority-black neighborhoods were assessed at a ratio of 1.2494 while single-family homes in majority-white neighborhoods were assessed at a ratio of 0.775.====Over- and under-assessment are not problematic as long as everyone is equally mis-assessed, because the property tax rate is set to raise some budgeted revenue. For example, if everyone's property values are assessed at double their true values, then everyone's nominal tax rate will be halved and the same revenue will be raised. However, if different properties are over- or under-assessed differently, then the tax revenue will be disproportionately raised from some people more than others, notwithstanding the equal nominal tax rate. According to Rothstein (2017: 172), this violates the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. Atuahene and Hodge (2018: 264) consider discriminatory assessment a form of “stategraft,” which they define as “when state agents transfer property from residents to the state in violation of the state's own laws and to the detriment of a vulnerable group.”====However, there are few recent studies of racially discriminatory property taxation. Besides Lee (2004), Atuahene (2018), and Atuahene and Hodge (2018), every study predates the literature reviews by Baar (1981) and Lyons (1982). Rothstein (2017: 172) concludes, “There are no contemporary studies of assessed-to-market value ratios by community and by race, so we cannot say whether discriminatory tax assessments persist to the present time, and if so, in which communities.” In this paper, I use data from Fulton County – the principal county of Atlanta, Georgia – to test whether there is any contemporary evidence of racial or socioeconomic discrimination in housing assessment.====Lee (2004: 33-39) summarizes why racially discriminatory assessment may exist: (1) to favor curry favor with influential voting constituencies – especially the whiter and wealthier – who are more likely to challenge assessments and property tax increases,==== (2) because there is a greater incentive to appeal the assessment for high-valued property, (3) because of assessment lag – meaning that infrequent assessments benefit appreciating properties whose assessments are not updated,==== and hypothetically (4) to reduce white flight from the city to the suburbs.====Regression-based mass appraisal techniques could be sufficient to eliminate discrimination and other disparities. Most US counties and states modernized their property tax systems in the 1960s and 1970s, sparking the tax revolts of the 1970s and 1980s (Martin 2008). Many residential properties had been under-assessed relative to commercial properties by corrupt assessors in return for bribes and votes.==== Modernization included centralization, systematization, professionalization, and computerization (Martin 2008, Baar 1981: 352ff.). Modernized assessment caused homes to be assessed at closer to their true market values, resulting in unexpectedly high tax bills for many, in turn sparking tax revolts (Martin 2008). But since the early 1980s, there has been little research on whether modernized assessment has reduced the prevalence of discriminatory assessment. Baar (1981: 394ff.) observes that discriminatory assessment persisted in Chicago even after the advent of modern, regression-based methods.====As we shall see, I find no evidence of racially or socioeconomically discriminatory property assessment in Fulton County / Atlanta, Georgia. This suggests that assessments are uniform and/or that the appeals process is sufficiently accessible to allow owners of mis-assessed properties to successfully appeal. This also suggests that when performed properly and systematically, regression-based mass-appraisal techniques are capable of eliminating racial discrimination from the property tax.====Of course, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. Nevertheless, it is encouraging to find absence of evidence for a once-pervasive form of discrimination. In fact, I find that homes in black neighborhoods of Fulton County are ====-assessed. Because my hypothesis of racial discrimination is one-sided, I merely conclude a lack of evidence of discrimination against blacks, not evidence of “reverse discrimination” in favor of blacks. Future research should study other cities as well to determine whether absence of discriminatory assessment in the Atlanta metro area is exceptional, or whether lack of discrimination is (hopefully) typical in districts where regression-based mass-appraisal techniques are used.====Null results are important for at least two reasons: first, as Rothstein (2017: 172) notes, there are few contemporary studies of this issue, and so our knowledge is very limited. Second, if it turns out that discriminatory assessment is still a problem in some cities, it is important for us to know where it is ==== a problem, so that we know where to find models for a non-discriminatory assessment process. It is easier to fix problems if we know where those problems are absent. For example, we may wish to compare the assessment notices which are mailed to residents in different cities, to see whether some notices are easier to read or understand – and therefore appeal – than others. Or perhaps there are differences in the application or sophistication of regression-based methods by different localities. Therefore, the null result for Fulton County is still noteworthy.====The outline of this paper is straightforward: first, section II, explains a few more institutional details about property assessment in Fulton County. In section III – with two sub-sections – I detail my (a) data and (b) methods. Section IV presents results in two sub-sections: (a) reports simple measurements of discrimination: the price-related differential (PRD) and coefficient of dispersion (COD) descriptive statistics, Gini coefficients, and tabulated mean assessment-sale ratios by different quantiles of home characteristics; and (b) reports OLS regression results for all sales. Finally, section V concludes. Additional robustness tests are presented in an online appendix.","Is There Discrimination in Property Taxation?

The literature shows that homeownership may reduce owners’ mobility and deteriorate their labor market performance. Using data from the 2016 China Migrants Dynamic Survey (CMDS) and the 2017 China Household ==== Survey (CHFS), we examine the effect of homeownership on labor force participation (LFP). We find that, compared to rental migrants, homeowner migrants, particularly married females, are less likely to participate in the labor force. Mechanism analysis shows that commuting time to potential jobs increases after migrants live in their properties and females are more sensitive to commuting costs because of domestic responsibilities.","With China's rapid urbanization, the domestic flow of rural populations to urban areas represents one of the largest migration in human history (Tombe and Zhu, 2019) and many migrants purchase properties in destination cities. However, homeownership may have the unintended labor market consequences of reducing household mobility and narrowing the job search scope of homeowners. Understanding how homeownership influences labor force participation (hereafter LFP) of rural-to-urban migrants is of special interest to an emerging economy, whose growth relies on the success of a massive flow of migrants from rural to urban areas. As such, any negative effects of homeownership on LFP can shed light on future economic growth and guide future policy designs. Although the impact of homeownership on labor market outcomes (mainly unemployment or wages) has been intensively studied in developed countries, the effect of homeownership on LFP in developing countries has rarely been explored. This paper attempts to fill this gap by examining the impact that homeownership has on the LFP of rural-to-urban migrants in China.====We argue that homeownership has a negative impact on LFP. China's real estate market is developing rapidly, with both prices and construction surging (Glaeser et al., 2017). High housing prices have led to long commuting times because of the growing distance between home and workplace (Li et al., 2020). The problem of high housing costs may be even worse for migrants who purchase homes later than residents in destination cities. Migrants may be located in disadvantaged areas farther from the city center, where housing is cheaper but where there are fewer job opportunities. The commuting costs could thus be prohibitive enough to keep married women from seeking work, who pay a higher price for long-distance commuting because of their domestic responsibilities.====To study the impact of destination homeownership on LFP, the main identification problem is the likely presence of unobserved individual preferences or wealth effects that are correlated with both living in one's own home and the decision to participate in the labor force. We adopt three empirical strategies. First, we use the homeownership rate in the same destination city-district or county as an instrumental variable (IV) for an individual's homeownership status.==== An individual migrant's destination homeownership status should be correlated with the homeownership status of other migrants in the same destination, but whether the person decides to work should not be directly affected by the average homeownership rate of migrants. We are unlikely to be subject to the concern in Coulson and Fisher (2009) because the proportion of rural migrants in urban areas is not high enough to compel firms to respond to their homeownership rate. Second, we restrict the sample to compare similar migrants who own property in the same destination city, with one group of migrants who live in their own homes and another group of migrants who live in rental homes. This approach allows us to control for an important confounding factor – the wealth effect. To further reduce this concern, we utilize having a son in the destination city as another IV for homeownership because the literature has documented that owning a house could increase one's son's competitiveness in the marriage market in China (Wei and Zhang, 2011). While neither of these methods is perfect, each helps to address the endogeneity issue to some extent.====Our empirical analysis relies on three data sources. The primary dataset is the 2016 China Migrants Dynamic Survey (CMDS), which contains a nationally representative sample of migrants. The second dataset is the China Household Finance Survey (CHFS), which is a nationally representative survey on household finance in China. This dataset allows us to compare the effect of homeownership on LFP between urban residents and migrants. The third dataset is housing transaction data from Beike, the largest real estate agency in China, which provides necessary information about China's housing market (housing prices, distance of homes to city centers, and construction years).====We find that compared to migrants who live in rental homes, migrants who live in their own homes are less likely to participate in the labor force, and these effects mainly exist among married women. The results are consistent across different identification strategies and are robust when considering the housing wealth effect. In contrast, we do not find that homeownership decreases the LFP of urban residents. This null result is consistent with the argument that local residents, unlike migrants, are not disadvantaged in the housing and labor markets in urban areas.====To show the possible mechanisms at work, we examine the role that commuting costs, domestic responsibilities, and being a secondary earner play in our results. We find that commute time is positively correlated with homeownership for migrants, especially female migrants, but not for local residents. This result is consistent with our hypothesis that migrants living in their own home suffer from longer commuting distance. When exploring the role of domestic responsibilities, we find that the effect of homeownership on LFP is smaller (and insignificant) for single women and that there is a positive relationship between housework duties and homeownership for married women migrants. Lastly, we show that being a secondary earner does not fully explain our results. Overall, mechanism analysis demonstrates that the significantly negative effect of homeownership on LFP is working through the more elastic LFP of married women.====Our study is closely related to the literature on homeownership and labor market outcomes. Most prior papers focus on unemployment and some study wages (Battu et al., 2008; Coulson and Fisher 2009; Munch et al., 2006). Using data from the Czech Republic, Mikula and Montag (2019) examine both unemployment and LFP and find that homeownership does not hinder LFP but reduces unemployment.==== In addition, these studies do not explore heterogeneity by gender. There are a few studies that examine housing price appreciation and LFP by gender (Fu et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2018). These both find female LFP responds to housing price appreciation but male LFP does not.==== While both Fu et al. (2016) and Zhao et al. (2018) restrict their samples to homeowners, we focus on the comparison between homeowner migrants and rental migrants. We contribute to the literature by focusing on homeownership and LFP and providing heterogeneous effects by gender. To the best of our knowledge, we are among the first to associate destination homeownership with lower LFP among female migrants in China.====Our paper is also related to the literature on women's LFP. The literature has exclusively focused on the labor supply of women since labor supply is rather inelastic for men (Havet and Penot, 2010). Compared to men, women shoulder more housework and caregiving responsibilities (Lee and McDonald, 2003; Maurer-Fazio et al., 2011; Rouwendal, 1999; Silveira Neto et al., 2015).==== Therefore, women are more sensitive to commuting costs, work closer to home, and are more likely to withdraw from the labor market. A longer commute time is associated with lower LFP of married women in the U.S. (Black et al., 2014) and Tokyo (Kawabata and Abe, 2018). We contribute to the literature by showing that both longer commuting costs and domestic responsibilities induce a lower LFP rate of married female migrants in China.====We also contribute to the research on women's LFP in China. Though LFP of female non-migrant laborers has been studied intensively, few studies focus on female rural-to-urban migrant laborers. Among the few studies in the literature, Meng (2012) documents that in 2009, the LFP rate of female rural-to-urban migrants was 93.4%, which is higher than the rate we find in 2016 (73.3%). A reduction in LFP among female non-migrant laborers has been well documented (Chen and Ge, 2018; Feng et al., 2017; Hare, 2016).==== We contribute to the literature by focusing on female rural-to-urban migrants and demonstrating that the homeownership rate of migrants plays a role in reducing LFP.====The rest of the paper will proceed as follows. Section 2 provides background information on migration and the housing market in China and develops our hypotheses. Section 3 discusses our identification strategy. Section 4 outlines our data. The results are presented in Section 5. The mechanisms driving the results are analyzed in Section 6.

However, little attention has been paid to contexts that might impact discrimination on the housing market, partly due to the fact that these factors have not been integrated into a comprehensive study. We aim to investigate whether the types of discriminatory behavior vary and/or are moderated by three types of contextual factors: (1) dwelling indicators, such as type of dwelling and price category; (2) neighborhood indicators, such as socioeconomic and ethnic composition of the neighborhood; and – to the best of our knowledge the first time in research - (3) real estate agency indicators, such as the gender structure and size of the agency. For this purpose, we made use of data from 2,014 matched correspondence tests on ethnic discrimination among 493 real estate agencies in Brussels Capital Region in Belgium. Our findings suggest that candidates of North African origin face discrimination when searching for an apartment to rent. We also found that discrimination is lower in poorer and more ethnically mixed neighborhoods and higher in smaller and male-dominated real estate offices. We call for a bigger focus on both spatial and organizational context in research on discrimination.","Ethnic discrimination proves to be a persistent problem on the rental housing market (Auspurg et al., 2019; Flage, 2018; Quillian et al., 2020). The effects of discrimination not only determine access to proper housing but can also result in accumulating social and economic disadvantages.====Many scholars have already examined the magnitude of ethnic discrimination on the rental housing market. Ethnic minorities seeking housing are still confronted with discrimination by both private landlords and real estate agents at high rates (Auspurg et al., 2019; Flage, 2018; Quillian et al., 2020). More concretely, a recent meta-analysis of Flage (2018) indicated that the likeliness of being invited to visit a rental dwelling is 50 percent higher for a majority candidate, than an ethnic minority candidate. Whereas previous research focused on measuring and addressing ethnic discrimination on the housing market, we aim to examine how discrimination relates to contextual factors such as company structures and neighborhood characteristics. In our view, approaches that highlight individual preferences and prejudices as the primary driver for discrimination are necessarily limited. Racism and discrimination do not emerge in a societal vacuum.====There has been little attention paid to contexts that might impact discrimination on the housing market, partly due to the fact that these factors have not been integrated into a comprehensive study, until now. In this paper, we will add as variables neighborhood and real estate office characteristics to a field experiment conducted with e-mail correspondence tests in a metropolitan city, to evaluate the importance of context in research on discrimination on the housing market.====This study aims to address these caveats of previous research in several ways. First, previous economic studies on the labor market have repeatedly included company characteristics when reporting about discrimination in hiring. These characteristics, including firm size (Baert et al., 2018), gender structure (Bertogg et al., 2020) and personnel turnover (Carlsson and Rooth, 2007) prove to be highly important when analyzing discriminatory behavior. We contribute to the economic literature on discrimination by including firm size and firm gender structure in our analysis of rental discrimination. Second, although previous studies have already examined the impact of neighborhood characteristics (Bonnet et al., 2016; Hanson and Hawley, 2014; Van der Bracht et al., 2015), this is to our knowledge the first study that investigates the context of real estate offices within a target neighborhood setting to study ethnic discrimination on the housing market. We were able to compare the differences in discrimination rates between realtor offices by including the size and gender structure of the real estate company in our analysis. The focus in previous economic studies on the housing market has mostly been on applicant characteristics, agent characteristics and differences in discrimination rates between a landlord and a real estate office (Carlsson and Eriksson, 2014; Flage, 2018); to our knowledge, this shall be the first to highlight contextual variation and differences between real estate offices. Additionally, we have controlled for ethnic composition and social-economic characteristics within a neighborhood. Although some research has been carried out where ethnic composition of a neighborhood has factored significantly (Auspurg et al., 2017), there have been few studies that have measured for socioeconomic characteristics.====To study these gaps in research, we used data from a correspondence study conducted in the capital region of Brussels, Belgium. The use of field experiments to study ethnic discrimination has become increasingly popular (Gaddis, 2018). In addition, we used administrative data from official records on economic, social, and demographic characteristics of neighborhoods and real estate offices in the city. This allows us to discuss results of discrimination, how it relates to company structures and urban segregation patterns. By doing so, we attempt to build a broader and multidimensional explanatory model that results in concrete research recommendations.",How does ethnic discrimination on the housing market differ across neighborhoods and real estate agencies?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137721000747,27 November 2021,2021,Research Article,48.0

This paper investigates whether cultures—defined as behavioral attitudes passed across generations—may value homeownership differently, and could thus be a driving demand factor of the homeownership decision. To isolate the effect of cultural preferences regarding homeownership from the impact of other economic factors, we investigate second-generation immigrants’ homeownership decisions in the United States between 1994 and 2017. Our findings indicate that cultural preferences for homeownership are persistent, transmitted between generations, and substantially influence the rent-versus-buy decision.","Cross-country differences in homeownership rates are large and persistent over time. Especially in Europe, homeownership rates vary substantially from 44% in Switzerland to 83% in Spain. Despite the large attention housing markets have received recently, there are few empirical studies that aim to explain why homeownership rates differ so greatly across countries. The decision of whether to rent or buy is usually the most important financial choice a household takes in its lifetime. It is often assumed that households take a “user cost approach”—comparing the two options in an analytical manner with a view to optimize the expected financial outcome. In contrast, this paper investigates whether “culture” is one of the driving factors of the homeownership decision, and could thus explain part of the cross-country differences in homeownership rates.====We interpret “culture” broadly, capturing the behavioral attitudes towards homeownership transmitted from generation to generation. These behavioral attitudes could result from historical macroeconomic and institutional experiences or deeply embedded preferences and values. We interpret parental homeownership experience and parental cultural preferences towards homeownership as two sides of the same coin. For owners, the fact of owning a housing asset (homeownership experience) leads to a higher valuation being attributed to this asset by the owner (i.e., “endowment effect”, “loss aversion”). At the same time, the homeownership preference of renters is likely to be stronger the higher the homeownership rate (e.g., “keeping up with the Joneses”, “conformity bias”, “social norms”). Whether preferences lead to institutional outcomes or vice-versa is beyond the scope of this paper.====To isolate the effect of culture on the homeownership decision from the effects of institutions and economic factors, we employ the epidemiological approach. Differences in institutions like housing market regulations (e.g., taxation, transaction costs, mortgage markets) may cause households to expect a different return from homeownership, thereby affecting the homeownership decision differentially. Therefore, we investigate the homeownership decision of second-generation immigrant household heads in the United States using data from the Current Population Survey from 1994 to 2017. A second-generation immigrant is defined as an individual who was born in the United States, but whose parents were born abroad. All second-generation immigrants have therefore grown up with the same markets and institutions. Parental cultural background, and hence behavioral attitudes, beliefs, and preferences towards homeownership might, however, differ. If culture is persistent over time and is transmitted from generation to generation, then we would expect to find systematic differences in terms of behavioral attitudes, beliefs, and preferences across second-generation immigrant groups from different countries of origin. Thus, systematic differences in the rent-versus-buy decision of second-generation immigrant groups that correlate with their behavior in their country of ancestry would point to cultural attitudes towards homeownership being responsible for such behavioral differences.====We proxy the homeownership preferences of second-generation immigrants using aggregate homeownership rates in the country of ancestry.==== In a second specification and using a smaller dataset, we use a differentiated homeonwership rate along the dimensions of age and income and assign the corresponding homeownership rates in the country of ancestry to the second-generation migrants in the sample.====As a first descriptive result, we show that second-generation immigrants are on average as likely to own their primary residence as native households.==== However, we document a considerable variation in homeownership rates across second-generation immigrant groups—defined by the country of origin of their fathers. In fact, the persistent cross-country differences in homeownership rates are replicated in the United States by the descendants of migrants from those countries (Fig. 1). To understand this positive relationship found at the macro-level, we investigate the homeownership decision on the micro-level, using second-generation immigrant household heads as our subjects of study.====We find that a second-generation immigrant with a father that emigrated from a high homeownership country is significantly more likely to be a homeowner in the United States than a second-generation immigrant with a father from a low homeownership country.==== It is important to ensure that our results are not driven by a systematic difference in second-generation immigrants depending on the country of ancestry. Therefore, we control for individual characteristics that are known to be important for the decision of whether to rent or buy. Specifically, we control for age, gender, race, marital status, number of children, educational attainment, employment status, income, and savings. Housing structures or housing costs might differ from location to location and over time. We control for these differences, regardless of their source, by including a vector of metropolitan area and year dummies. Data limitations prevent us from measuring parental income directly. We propose different proxies for parental income and wealth and show that our results are robust to their inclusion.====The quantitative impact of culture on the homeownership decision is sizeable for second-generation immigrant household heads. An increase in the homeownership rate in the country of origin of the immigrant’s father by one standard deviation is associated with a 0.5 percentage point increase in the probability that an average second-generation immigrant is a homeowner in the United States. This accounts for 5.3% of the variation in homeownership rates across second-generation immigrant groups within the United States. The quantitative impact of the presented baseline estimate could be a lower bound for the general effect of culture on the homeownership decision. Several factors may mitigate the influence of the ancestor’s cultural attitude towards homeownership: friendships==== of the second-generation immigrants with natives and other immigrant groups, a spouse of a different cultural background, and the markets and institutions in the United States.====To unravel these effects and thereby explore the impact of culture on the homeownership decision in a sharper way, we focus on second-generation immigrant household heads that are married to a spouse of the same cultural background, and compare their homeownership decision with those that are single, and those that are married to a spouse of a different cultural background. For a second-generation immigrant, it is likely that the spouse plays an important role in preserving beliefs and preferences (spouse effect). Besides, one can expect that individuals who feel strongly attached to their country of ancestry are also more likely to marry someone from this country (selection effect). Therefore, the preferences, beliefs, and values of second-generation immigrants married to a same cultural background spouse might be the closest to those prevailing in the country of ancestry. This group might reflect the culture towards homeownership of the father’s home country most accurately.====As expected, the impact of culture on the homeownership decision is largest for second-generation immigrant household heads that are married to a spouse of the same cultural background. For this subset, the impact of culture is three times larger compared to singles, and nine times larger compared to household heads that are married to a spouse of a different cultural background. The effect is also much larger compared to the baseline estimate; an increase in the homeownership rate in the country of origin of the immigrant’s father by one standard deviation (across countries) is associated with a 3.7 percentage point increase in the probability that an average married second-generation immigrant with a spouse of the same cultural background is a homeowner in the United States. This accounts for 39% of the variation in the homeownership rate across second-generation immigrant groups within the United States. Finally, we present evidence for the hypothesis that the impact of the ancestor’s culture vanishes over time. The effect of cultural preferences is larger for first-generation married couples with the same cultural background than for second-generation couples with the same background.====In summary, this paper highlights the role of culture for the observed large and persistent cross-country differences in homeownership rates. Our findings indicate that cultural attitudes towards homeownership are persistent, transmitted between generations, and substantially influence the rent-versus-buy decision.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the related literature. Section 3 outlines our empirical strategy, describes the data and sample selection. Section 4 presents the baseline results. Section 5 shows the results for more homogeneous subgroups of second-generation immigrants and investigates cultural transmission. Section 6 discusses the robustness of our findings.

Housing wealth constitutes a significant fraction of household worth, and this feature has prompted many studies regarding the association between labor supply and housing wealth. However, the existing literature (e.g., Henley, 2004, Jacob and Ludwig, 2012, Johnson, 2014, Disney and Gathergood, 2018) does not offer a consistent answer to this question, and few studies shed light on this topic in developing countries. Moreover, the most existing literature focuses on exploring an individual’s absolute wealth while ignoring relative wealth which is a non-standard path that influences labor supply as suggested by several studies (Cole et al., 1995, Fisher and Hof, 2008, Atolia and Prasad, 2011). In this paper, we adopt China’s two-decade-long housing market boom to symmetrically investigate the effects of the self-reported, regional, and relative housing wealth on homeowners’ labor supply.====A wide range of literature (e.g., Henley, 2004, Disney and Gathergood, 2018, Zhao and Burge, 2017) has investigated the effect of regional housing wealth on individual labor supply. To avoid the endogeneity problems involved when estimating homeowners’ labor supply with models that incorporate housing wealth, these papers use region-level housing wealth instead of individual-level housing wealth to measure homeowners’ housing values. They find that regional housing market conditions have significant effects on labor supply for specific groups of people.====Although regional housing wealth is a key determinant of homeowners’ labor supply, this proxy does not precisely capture the impact of housing wealth on homeowners’ labor supply. Because the identification of regional housing wealth comes from between-region differences in housing price growth, regional housing wealth is likely to be a weak driver of individual labor market choices as opposed to within household or region changes in housing wealth. As a result, the effect of regional housing wealth may not be significant on individual homeowner’s labor market outcomes.====Besides, recent studies realize the shortcoming of regional housing wealth and hereby use individual housing wealth to investigate the effect of housing wealth on labor market outcomes (e.g., Jacob and Ludwig, 2012, Fu et al., 2016). Due to the lack of housing trade information, these studies mainly adopt indirect measures, such as self-reported housing values and housing vouchers, to capture the individual housing wealth. They find that individual-level housing wealth significantly affects homeowners’ labor supply.====In the circumstance of China, we find that regional housing wealth does not significantly affect individual homeowner’s labor supply while regional housing wealth insignificantly affects individual homeowner’s labor supply in our empirical analysis. To explain such a difference between the effect of regional housing wealth and the effect of self-reported housing wealth, this paper proposes a relative measure of housing wealth—relative housing wealth that is defined as the difference between a homeowner’s self-reported housing value and her or his community’s regional housing wealth value. Essentially, relative housing wealth measures a homeowner’s housing wealth related to the housing wealth of others in the region.====Relative housing wealth can play a significant role in determining individual labor market outcomes. Theoretically, people are motivated by a desire for rank and social status in economics, suggested by several studies (Smith, 1759, Veblen, 1899).==== Therefore, individual labor market decisions can be affected by relative housing wealth through the change of relative rank in housing wealth. Practically, the adoption of relative housing wealth is a reasonable methodology for exploring the effect of housing wealth on a homeowner’s labor supply. Because homeowners may not perceive the substantial increase in housing wealth if the housing wealth in the local area rises simultaneously, they would shape their labor market decisions based on their estimations on housing values related to others’ housing values.====This paper first develops a theoretical model to explain the role of wealth on labor supply. To examine our theoretical predictions, we investigate the effect of housing wealth on a homeowner’s labor supply in the context of China’s housing boom. To alleviate potential endogeneity problems of individual-level housing wealth, we construct an instrumental variable (IV) following the method suggested by Hausman and Taylor (1981) and Hausman (1996). In particular, we adopt neighbors’ average housing wealth in the community as the IV since it correlates with a homeowner’s housing wealth and is unlikely to be a determinant of the homeowner’s labor supply.====China’s housing boom is a fitting natural experiment for investigating the effect of housing wealth on labor supply. First, for Chinese households, housing is counted as a major part of wealth. The 2016 Survey Report of Household Wealth by the China Economic Daily showed that the net value of real estate accounted for 65.61% of the total wealth of a household in China.==== Under this wealth allocation, surging housing prices may result in a large wealth shock to the household.====Second, the housing market has been experiencing an unprecedented long-term boom since the abolition of the welfare-oriented public housing distribution system in 1998. Fig. 1 shows the trend of new housing price indexes for 70 large and medium-sized cities in China during the period 2005–2011. The mean values of new housing price indexes continuously rose, from 101 in 2005 to 143 in 2011, with an average growth rate of approximately 6%. New housing price indexes in different percentiles display similar increasing trends. Additionally, recent studies document that land and housing prices have grown rapidly in China’s largest cities since 2000 (Fang et al., 2016, Glaeser et al., 2017).==== Third, for Chinese households, housing is a valuable investment. As Fig. 2 displays, the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) presents the average growth rate of housing values reported by respondents as 25%, which is three times the average growth rate of individual income. Furthermore, the ratio of self-reported housing values to individual labor income rose sharply from 7.6 in 2000 to 34.7 in 2011 (see Fig. 3). These patterns are similar for both female and male samples.====Fourth, although almost every homeowner has benefited from housing price appreciation during the housing boom period, there are differences in relative housing wealth. Fig. 4 reports the trend of relative housing wealth during the period 2000–2011. The gaps between the maximum and minimum values of individuals’ relative housing wealth consistently expanded, with the means being close to zero.====In this scenario, we use relative housing wealth as a proxy for relative wealth and regional housing wealth as a measure for average wealth, respectively. Regional housing wealth is defined as the product of average city-level housing prices and average community-level housing size for each community. Meanwhile, the relative housing wealth is the difference between a homeowner’s self-reported housing value and her or his community’s regional housing wealth value. Based on this construction, regional housing wealth implies the average housing wealth in the local area, and its variation captures the growth trend of the housing wealth in the local area. In addition, relative housing wealth measures the relative position of a homeowner’s housing wealth in her or his community, and the variation in this variable suggests the positional change in the homeowner’s housing wealth in the local community.====Empirical results show that an appreciation in relative housing wealth significantly reduces homeowners’ working hours, but no significant effect on employment is found. According to our IV estimations, on average, a one-million ==== increase in relative housing wealth causes a 3.81% reduction in annual working hours, which is equivalent to a decrease of approximately 69 h (9 working days) per year.==== In addition, we find that the effect of relative housing wealth on working hours is driven by female homeowners. This result is consistent with the negative effect of housing wealth on labor supply in existing studies (Li and Wu, 2014, Fu et al., 2016). Performing a set of robustness checks that consider the labor contract law, age criterion, extreme values, double-income households, home mortgages, individual fixed effects, and adjusted housing values, we find that our results are consistent across various specifications.====We further examine the heterogeneous effects of relative housing wealth on labor supply. First, both self-employed female homeowners and self-employed male homeowners significantly decrease working hours after experiencing an increase in their relative housing wealth. In our analysis sample, a one-million ==== increase reduced working hours by approximately 440 h (55 working days) and 149 h (19 working days) for self-employed female homeowners and self-employed male homeowners, respectively. Second, we find that increased relative housing wealth significantly decreases working hours for both married female homeowners and married male homeowners. Third, less-educated female homeowners significantly reduce working hours with increased relative housing wealth. Fourth, relative housing wealth significantly decreases rural homeowners’ working hours. Fifth, we find that an appreciation in relative housing wealth has a smaller effect on the working hours of middle-age homeowners compared to young and old homeowners in the female group.====Our work contributes to the growing literature on the role of housing wealth in labor supply (Johnson, 2014, Charles et al., 2018, Zhao and Burge, 2017). We introduce a relative measure of housing wealth to capture the different labor market effects between self-reported housing wealth and regional housing wealth. Our findings suggest that relative housing wealth is a key component in understanding the effect of housing wealth on labor supply. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first to employ the relative measurement to study homeowners’ responses to housing wealth.====Besides, this study contributes to the existing literature on estimating the effects of housing wealth on labor supply in developing economies. Due to the differences in economic development, the patterns of these impacts may vary across economies. Compared to the numerous studies in developed economies, limited evidence is available for developing economies. Our work makes a valuable addition to research (Li and Wu, 2014, Fu et al., 2016) associated with the housing wealth and labor supply in China, the world’s largest developing economy. We provide new evidence by adopting the relative measure of housing wealth, and our findings augment the understanding of the role of housing wealth in explaining the individual labor supply in China.====This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 constructs a model to illustrate the effect of various housing wealth on labor supply, Section 3 introduces the data, Section 4 provides the comparison of effects between self-reported housing wealth and regional housing wealth, Section 5 presents the effect of relative housing wealth, and Section 6 concludes the paper.","Regional housing wealth, relative housing wealth and labor market behavior",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137721000656,20 October 2021,2021,Research Article,53.0

Housing investment is an important element of life-cycle decisions. One special feature of housing is its lumpiness/indivisibility. Will the minimum house size one can purchase in the market affect the life-cycle risky financial asset investment and housing investment in the presence of mortgage constraints? Despite the attention that the life-cycle consumption/housing problem has received, the role of the Minimum Housing Scale constraint (MHS) in the housing and equity investment decisions has been elusive. Cocco (2005) finds that a minimum housing size prevents equity market participation and lowers stock holdings for homeowners. But the focus of his paper is not particularly the impact of the indivisibility of housing, but rather the presence of housing in household portfolio choice.====The MHS is affected by regulatory constraints such as the minimum lot size regulation in the US, housing standards such as the Nationally Described Space Standards (NDSS) in the UK, and physical (or geographical) constraints etc. The aim of this paper is to study how the MHS interacts with mortgage constraints to affect the life-cycle risky financial asset investment and housing investment and tenure choice. In the UK, the MHS is likely to play an important role, since the NDSS is a single tier national space standard and there is a non-trivial share of housing at the MHS size.==== We use the UK as a relevant example to evaluate the theory by calibration.====There are some stylised facts for UK housing and financial asset decisions:====(i) Empirically, the extent of homeownership for different cohorts at age 30 varies a lot according to macro conditions of the year when they were 30 (Bottazzi et al., 2015).====(ii) On average, UK households hold a relatively small proportion of their wealth in financial assets compared with the US (Banks et al., 2002).====(iii) In recent decades buy-to-let has become increasingly prevalent. In UK data the percentage of renters in the population has increased, whilst in 2019 the number of outstanding mortgages for buy-to-let (BTL) was 61% higher than in 1999 (UK Finance, 2019).====We set up a life-cycle model where individuals derive utility from housing and non-housing consumption, and make decisions about consumption and investment under uncertainty. Our simulation results with Stone-Geary preferences show that:====(i) The existence of MHS reduces the home ownership rate at every age, and results in a long-term higher level of wealth inequality. MHS is an extra barrier in addition to the mortgage constraints for young people who are low in cash to get onto the housing ladder. Although MHS is more important in rationing people out of housing ownership early in life, its long-term impact in inequality of housing is also significant.====(ii) The MHS generates the empirical increasing risky asset share profile before retirement age for homeowners. This is related to the equity non-participation puzzle. For young homeowners, the share of risky asset in net worth is low due to the binding MHS constraint. This share increases over time as the MHS becomes slack.====(iii) The combination of low labour income and the presence of MHS makes buy-to-let behaviour less likely.====Allowing for the tenure choice is theoretically and empirically important. First, renting and buying with or without a mortgage have different risks (Deng et al., 2000); Sinai and Souleles (2005) find that empirically the volatility of rent can exceed the risk in house prices. Silos (2007) studies housing tenure choice in an overlapping generations economy, suggesting a model improvement relative to a housing model with no rental markets.====Our modelling of the household’s problem is related to a set of literature on the life-cycle consumption/housing problem with housing tenure choice and uncertain income and asset returns (Yao and Zhang, 2005, Li and Yao, 2007, Silos, 2007, Díaz and Luengo-Prado, 2008, Attanasio et al., 2012), where housing tenure decisions (renting or owning a home) are endogenised, and borrowing is allowed against housing assets subject to a down payment constraint. In terms of modelling, our paper differs from the existing literature in the following aspects. First, we show that with arbitrary time additive concave expected utility, the constraints generate a feasible set with segmented linear boundaries. From this we can characterise the likely form of theoretical solutions. Second, still theoretically we impose within period Stone-Geary preferences and derive the range of analytical closed-form solutions for the optimal portfolio, tenure, and housing services. The actual dynamic time path of solutions still depends on realisations of random variables, and so has to be simulated. Third, unlike Brueckner (1997), we do not impose any restriction on the relative magnitude of housing consumption and housing investment, which allows for many different choices including renting only, owner occupation, buy to let, partly renting, and partly owning (e.g. the shared ownership scheme in the UK).====In terms of the research question, our paper is also related to an existing literature studying limited stock market participation focusing on cross-sectional variation and life-cycle variation. Cocco (2005) studies the portfolio choice of homeowners with a life-cycle model using simulation, and finds that house price risk crowds out stock holding, and that younger and poorer investors have limited financial wealth to invest in the stock market, attributing the limited stock participation to the low willingness to pay the fixed cost of equity participation in the presence of housing. Heaton and Lucas (2000) find empirical evidence that households with high and variable business income hold less wealth in stocks than other similarly wealthy households. These two papers both focus on the cross-sectional heterogeneity of investors and share the common intuition that uninsurable background risk (originating from housing, proprietary income) can influence portfolio allocations, because it makes people less willing to take other forms of risk such as stock market risk. Yao and Zhang (2005) use a similar model to Cocco (2005) except that they allow for tenure choice of renting and owning housing. They suggest a hedging demand for holding stocks when stock and housing returns are positively correlated. They attribute the lower stock holding for homeowners compared to the scenario of no correlation between stock and housing returns to the long position homeowners hold in housing assets. Benzoni et al. (2007) find that cointegration of labour and stock market leads to an empirical hump-shape in equity participation in household portfolios over the life-cycle. Prior literature has focused on the implications of background risk, positive correlation of housing and equity returns or cointegration of labour income on life-cycle choices. In contrast, we use independent returns and a MHS to understand features of life-cycle behaviour.====Of course with any constrained optimisation under uncertainty, the realisations of random income variables like labour income or asset returns may be so bad that future feasibility is impossible and the individual must default on his/her obligations. With only mortgage debt, the only possible default is on this (Campbell and Cocco, 2015). But in the UK even with the impact of the global financial crisis, mortgage default has been found less important. The UK arrears rate hovers around 1% of mortgage loan debt (Building Societies Association and Aron and Muellbauer (2016)). Consequently we abstract from these problems by essentially requiring that there is always a portfolio which has a zero probability of default. Instead we concentrate on how the life-cycle environment (basically the past of a household and its expected future) and the imperfect asset market restrictions affect the housing and financial asset portfolio choices of the household as it ages.====To summarise, our contribution is twofold. First, by deriving the analytical properties for general preference and closed-form solutions for Stone-Geary preferences, we shed light on the mechanisms governing housing tenure choices in a realistic environment. Second, our paper fills a gap in the literature in which the implications of MHS constraints have received less attention. Our baseline simulation studies individual life-cycle profiles when there are LTV, LTI, MHS constraints each period. To assess the impact of MHS we contrast the optimal profiles with worlds in which only one or two of LTI, LTV, MHS apply. Our results imply that the presence of the MHS may worsen poor people’s welfare by crowding them out of home ownership for a longer period of their life and exacerbate the wealth inequality both in risky asset investment and housing wealth in the long run. For younger individuals, the financial risky asset share in net worth is low due to the binding MHS. MHS also makes the BTL behaviour less likely.====The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 presents stylised facts about the UK housing market to motivate the paper. Section 3 introduces the general theory. Section 4 specialises the model to Stone-Geary within period utility and proves the linearity of the value function under some assumptions. Closed-form solutions are derived for this model. Section 5 simulates the life-cycle paths of consumption and asset allocation with stochastic income and asset return processes.

The subsidy was designed to cover a portion of annuities in the initial period of the housing ","The goal to make housing affordable has long been an important part of policymakers’ agenda. Living space (“shelter”) is a basic need, and for most households, obtaining housing is the single most important financial decision, often financed through debt. Households are usually willing to buy homes for several main reasons — economic and financial considerations, socio-demographic characteristics, and psychological and behavioral drivers (Hu, 2013). In addition to this individual perspective, high homeownership rates have many positive aspects. For example, they are often associated with lower crime rates (Dietz and Haurin, 2003), better child outcomes (Haurin et al., 2002), and more voting (DiPasquale and Glaeser, 1999). There are, on the other hand, many costs related to homeownership. Apgar (2004) and Lubell (2014) review some of the most important, including making a long-term commitment to living in a particular structure and neighborhood, investing in a nondiversified asset that can decrease in value, and less labor mobility (Caldera and Andrews, 2011).====Taking into account both positive and adverse aspects of homeownership, many countries are still willing to intervene directly in the housing market. They do so via fiscal measures in form of subsidies and taxes, direct provision of social housing and housing allowances, and regulation (Andrews and Sánchez, 2011, Andrews et al., 2011). Subsidies and taxes for promoting homeownership usually take form in mortgage-interest deduction, deduction of state and local property taxes, housing capital gains exclusion, and mortgage revenue bonds (Hembre, 2018). The question remains whether these measures result in higher homeownership rates. For example, a body of research questions if the mortgage interest deductions actually benefit potential house buyers (Hanson, 2012, Hilber and Turner, 2014, Rappoport, 2016, Sommer and Sullivan, 2018, Gruber et al., 2021). There is also a growing literature exploring the effect of changes in property transaction taxes on housing markets, see for example Dachis et al., 2012, Besley et al., 2014, Kopczuk and Munroe, 2015, Best and Kleven, 2018; while programs like First-Time Homebuyer Credit in the US (Hembre, 2018, Berger et al., 2020), Help to Buy in the UK (Szumilo and Vanino, 2018, Carozzi et al., 2020), or Pret a Taux Zero in France (Gobillon and Le Blanc, 2008) were introduced to promote homeownership. However, as Hilber and Turner (2014) and Hilber and Vermeulen (2016) indicate, a governmental program aimed at generating additional housing demand can capitalize to higher housing prices if the housing supply is inelastic.====Building on this literature, in this paper, we explore the effect of housing loan subsidies, introduced in Croatia in 2017 to make homeownership more affordable, on the housing market. The subsidy was designed to cover a portion of annuities in the initial period of the housing loan repayment. While the implementation of the subsidy changed throughout the years, the 2017 version of subsidies implied that the state would cover 50% of a monthly loan annuity for the first four years of the loan, which could be extended if the household had a child. A distinct feature of the measure, which separates this measure from other temporary programs, like First-Time Homebuyer Credit or Help to Buy, is that the household could apply for the subsidy only during a month-long period. This implies that a housing purchase had to also be completed during the same month-long period, which amplifies the distortive potential of the measure. Given that the housing loan subsidy provided a generous financial injection for the household, it soon became popular, accounting for around 10% of all residential transactions in Croatia, especially in areas with an already active housing market. As soon as the housing loan subsidy was introduced in September of 2017, housing prices in Croatia strongly increased (Fig. 1).====Using the micro dataset from the Tax Administration of the Ministry of Finance which contains the universe of residential transactions in Croatia from 2015 to 2019, we discuss the impact of housing loan subsidies on housing market dynamics and prices. We do not focus exclusively on subsidized housing transactions, but on the whole housing market as potential spillover effects might affect the broader population. We document that the subsidy largely disrupted the usual intra-annual dynamics of residential transactions. They became very concentrated in October, a month in which the housing loan subsidy applications ended. This implies that the subsidy created a market bottleneck that distorted price negotiations and the home search process as a residential transaction have to be completed in a short period. In addition, we do not find any evidence that the number of residential transactions or aggregate homeownership rate increased.====Using an event study approach, we find that housing prices, especially for flats and apartments, increased permanently just around the introduction of the government subsidy. We find that the most profound increase was in most developed municipalities, which absorbed more than 60% of the subsidies. Exploiting the housing loan subsidy built-in implementation rules (maximum total amount and the unit price that can be subsidized) and predetermined property characteristics (size that determines the total price, and year of build that determines unit price) we find that relatively more subsidized residential units experienced more profound price increases. Using these different treatment intensities we estimate dynamic difference-in-differences which corroborate our baseline conclusions. All these estimations offer a conclusion that the introduction of housing loan subsidy did not meet its proclaimed goals — it made housing less affordable and did not promote homeownership.====In order to document the effects of subsidy in more detail, we perform two additional analyses. Firstly, using differential subsidies based on the development of the municipality, we estimate the effect of subsidy ==== using geographical discontinuities, similar to, for example, Carozzi et al. (2020). We find that the relative prices of dwellings with a higher implied subsidy rate, compared with close-by dwellings with a lower subsidy rate, did not change following the loan subsidy program. While this finding suggests that the ==== did not result in any important capitalization effect, one should interpret these conclusions carefully as there is not a lot of subsidy variation in our discontinuity sample.====Secondly, in order to account for the effects of tourism on housing prices, we include tourism indicators in our event study analysis, and we also inspect if other observable measures of tourism and housing (share of houses bought by foreigners, intra-regional housing transactions within Croatia) show any discontinuities around the introduction of the housing loan subsidies. We find that our baseline results and conclusions hold. Nevertheless, we argue that tourism affected the observed housing price increase. In particular, following the reasoning from Hilber and Turner (2014) and Hilber and Vermeulen (2016), we argue that the constant pressure which tourism puts on the supply of residential properties, especially given the widespread prevalence of private accommodation in Croatia and a recent surge in short term rentals, making the supply of residential properties inelastic as the real estate properties are used for tourism and not residential purposes. Consequently, this led to price increases when the housing loan subsidy was introduced.====The paper is organized as follows: the next section explains the institutional background of subsidized housing loans, the third section provides more detail on the data used, the fourth section presents the results on the effect on the transaction quantities. The core of the paper, Section 5, explores in detail through multiple empirical strategies the effect of subsidized loans on housing affordability, while the last section concludes.",The effect of housing loan subsidies on affordability: Evidence from Croatia,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137721000632,2 October 2021,2021,Research Article,55.0

A similar tax was imposed in Toronto in April 2017. This paper empirically evaluates the effects of foreign buyer taxes (FBTs) on house prices in Vancouver and Toronto, using a variant of the panel program evaluation method with city-level data and a ==== method with house-level transaction data. Our results show that the FBT reduced the house prices in Vancouver by around 5% from 2016:M08 to 2017:M12, and by something within the range of 7% to 9% in Toronto from 2017:M04 to 2017:M12. These effects were concentrated in the single-detached home segment in both cities.","From 2010 to 2017, house prices increased by 64% in Vancouver and by 86% in Toronto, while increasing by 37% in the rest of Canada. Foreign purchasing has been the target of public outcry over soaring prices in Vancouver and Toronto. In this context, the British Columbia government imposed a foreign buyer tax (hereafter “FBT”) of 15% in Vancouver in August 2016, and the Ontario government imposed a similar tax in Toronto in April 2017. After a small decline following the introduction of the tax, house prices in Vancouver began to rebound in February 2017 and soon exceeded the pre-tax levels, while house prices in Toronto immediately dropped after the imposition of the FBT.====To what extent did FBTs affect house prices in Vancouver and Toronto? This issue is as controversial as the role of foreign buying in driving up house prices. On the one hand, the proportion of homes purchased by foreigners is relatively small, varying from 3 to 5% depending on the data source.==== The effects of FBTs on house prices would therefore be proportionally modest. On the other hand, the survey conducted by CMHC (2018) shows the catalytic role of foreign buying in driving up house prices. Though the proportion of homes bought by foreign buyers is small, more than half of homebuyers believe that foreign buying is the main driver of escalating prices in Vancouver and Toronto. This belief heightened, to some extent, irrational expectations of future price appreciation, precipitated market participations, and drove up house prices. Thus, the impacts of FBTs would be amplified and become large.====Yet, as heated debates continue, there are no policy evaluations on the effects of FBTs. This paper aims to evaluate the effects of FBTs on house prices in Vancouver and Toronto. We use a variant of the panel program evaluation approach of Hsiao et al. (2012, hereafter HCW) with city-level data and regression discontinuity design (RDD) with house-level transaction data.====The basic idea behind the panel data approach is that the house prices of different cities are often driven by some common factors; therefore, information on cities not subject to FBTs can help to construct the counterfactuals of Vancouver and Toronto. This is confirmed by the data analyzes below (cf. Fig. 2 to 3), which show that growth rates of house prices in Vancouver and Toronto before the introduction of FBTs can be fitted very well using the data of other global cities such as Atlanta, Beijing, Chicago, New York City, Seattle, Vienna, and Washington, D.C. The effects of FBTs are then just the differences between the growth rates of house prices actually observed in Vancouver and Toronto and counterfactual growth rates if FBTs had not been imposed. This method does not involve modeling how and why house prices have evolved over time and what factors have affected their evolution. Hence, the results are not affected by model specifications or by endogeneity problems.====To get more accurate counterfactual predictions, the optimal control group is selected using the adjusted R-squared and the AICC (Hurvich and Tsai, 1989) criterion as in Du et al. (2013) rather than the R-squared and the AIC (Akaike, 1974, 1973) criterion used in the original method proposed by HCW. As shown in Du et al. (2013), the modified method has smaller mean squared prediction errors.====We then use RDD with house-level transaction data to validate the results. RDD has been proven a robust program evaluation method because of its randomized variation near the cutoff (Lee and Lemieux, 2010). We use houses transacted before the implementation of FBTs as the control group and consider time as a running variable (Davis, 2008) in RDD. We also use a data-driven method to select the degree of polynomial of time trend in RDD.====The main results show that FBTs reduced annual growth rates in house prices by around 5% in Vancouver from August 2016 to December 2017 and by something in the range of 7 to 9% in Toronto from April 2017 to December 2017. In both cities, the FBT reduced the prices of single-detached homes, mainly. These results seem to support the hypothesis that foreign purchasing played a catalytic role in driving up house prices. However, the effects of FBTs on house prices were temporary, especially in Vancouver. Falsification tests using hypothetical policy windows and backward fitting validate the implementation of our program evaluations. The results are also robust using both foreign and Canadian cities as controls.====This paper provides empirical evidence to the heated debate on the effects of FBTs. Most existing studies focus on identifying the drivers of rising house prices. Head and Lloyd-Ellis (2016) use an asset-pricing method to evaluate house prices in some major cities. CMHC released a thorough report (CMHC, 2018) examining escalating house prices in major metropolitan centres in Canada. Pavlov and Somerville (2016) use the difference-in-differences method and show that immigration is not a key driver of overall house prices in Vancouver.Sá, (2017) shows properties purchased by foreign companies increased house price growth in England and Wales. This paper complements these studies by directly evaluating the effects of FBTs.====This paper also contributes to the growing literature on evaluating the effects of housing policies on house prices. As a large number of housing policies across global cities have been adopted with the narrow goal of curbing soaring house prices, some studies use new program evaluation methods to provide timely evaluations of some major housing policies on house prices. Bai et al==== (2014) evaluate the effects of property taxes on house prices in China using AIC to select optimal controls. Du and Zhang (2015) assess the effects of home restriction and property taxes on house prices in China using the leave-====-out cross-validation to select optimal controls, while Kuttner and Shim (2016) provide a cross-sectional study on the effects of non-interest housing policies. This paper evaluates the effects of FBTs on house prices using a panel data approach with city-level data and a RDD approach with house-level transaction data.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides the institutional background of our research.

The model accounts for other previously unexplored features of redevelopment, such as endogenous maintenance decisions. Numerical simulation results show that minimum lot size zoning delays the conversion of vacant land and slows demolition. Additionally, this type of zoning stabilizes housing redevelopment because developers have a greater incentive to maintain buildings under zoning.","Residential redevelopment, in which existing housing is torn down and replaced by new housing, is a key feature of urban development. In growing cities with rising house prices and incomes, residential neighborhoods are converted from lower to higher density in a series of redevelopment cycles that may take hundreds of years. Dye and McMillen (2007) document the widespread demolition and redevelopment in the Chicago metropolitan area. They show that redevelopment is rapid in suburban communities and in areas of cities experiencing substantial house-price appreciation. The rate of teardown in the inner-ring suburbs of Chicago between 2000 and 2010 was as high as 17 percent per census-block group (Charles, 2013). Moreover, teardowns are widespread nationally but are concentrated in older urban areas in the Northeast, the Midwest, and California (McMillen, 2006).====Policy makers use zoning regulations to influence structure choices for new housing and control the type and intensity of land use. This paper focuses on one type of zoning restriction: minimum lot size zoning, which constrains land inputs by defining the minimum amount of land that can be used to produce individual housing units. Minimum lot size zoning is very common and is particularly effective in constraining housing supply (Wheaton, 1993).====There has been no work on the long-run effects of minimum lot size zoning on the stability and characteristics of the housing stock in an environment in which housing prices and household incomes are rising. However, in many cities, long-term growth has put upward pressure on housing prices while land-use restrictions have remained unchanged. Moreover, zoning regulations have been identified by both Hsieh and Moretti (2017) and Herkenhoff et al. (2017) as a potential cause of welfare loss as labor is diverted from more productive cities. Their conclusions rest on the premise that the primary effect of zoning restrictions is to reduce the supply of housing and provides no compensating benefit to the area. The contribution of this paper is to study the long-run effects of minimum lot size zoning on housing redevelopment and identify its potential effects on neighborhood stability.====In order to investigate the effects of minimum lot size zoning on housing redevelopment in growing cities, this paper develops a discrete-time dynamic model of housing redevelopment in an area with rising incomes and housing prices. The effects of minimum lot size zoning are derived by comparing initial housing development, maintenance, and subsequent redevelopment under minimum lot size zoning with those variables under laissez-faire.====The model in this paper shares some features with the previous literature, including Brueckner (1981) and Anglin et al. (2014). However, a number of strong assumptions in the previous literature are relaxed in the current model. The current study assumes that housing prices and household incomes are growing at a constant rate over time. Housing developers choose the optimal maintenance expenditure, which makes the rate of structure deterioration endogenous. Unlike in the previous literature, developers’ choices include optimal maintenance and the constraint of minimum lot size zoning.==== The partial-equilibrium analysis focuses on the housing-supply side, following Arnott et al. (1999) and Bertaud and Brueckner (2005).====In addition to including endogenous maintenance expenditure, the current model adds several other new features. The cost of converting vacant land is included in the model to study the effects of minimum lot size zoning on land-conversion decisions. The land-subdivision process is also modeled because developers’ decisions are affected by infrastructure costs, which vary with residential density.====The most surprising results are that minimum lot size zoning lengthens the life of housing and protects neighborhoods from clearance and rebuilding. These are effects that have not previously been documented. Furthermore, this type of zoning provides more incentives for developers to maintain existing buildings. This slows structure deterioration and maintains a uniform level of housing-service quality in a neighborhood.====In addition, the simulation results show that minimum lot size zoning distorts factor proportions and reduces housing supply. These results are consistent with the previous literature.==== Moreover, minimum lot size zoning delays the development of vacant land. This finding diverges from the findings in Titman (1985) and Capozza and Li (1994). Their results imply that initial vacant-land development is accelerated by zoning regulations. The key assumption in their models is that the decision to convert land for urban development is irreversible. In contrast, the model developed in this paper assumes that development is not irreversible, because developers can demolish existing units and build new ones at optimal density.====In response to rising housing prices and incomes, it is more profitable for developers to replace small housing units with larger housing units and redevelop at a higher residential density. In a growing urban area, minimum lot size zoning eventually becomes binding and lowers the effective floor-area ratio (FAR). Overall, minimum lot size zoning is effective in stabilizing neighborhood development.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 develops the discrete-time dynamic programming model; Section 3 quantifies the effects of minimum lot size zoning using a numerical-simulation approach; Section 4 presents simulation results; and Section 5 discusses robustness checks.

Not surprisingly, the volume of research on the impact of the housing market on the overall macroeconomy has increased significantly since the Great Recession of 2008–09. The literature has postulated different channels through which the housing market affects the macroeconomy. In particular, two channels – net worth channel and the collateral channel – have received widespread attention from the researchers and the policymakers.====The high correlation between employment and house prices across different states in the U.S. was one of the prominent features of the financial crisis of 2008–09. This was especially pronounced in the states where house prices witnessed a dramatic collapse. To better understand the relationship between house price changes and employment conditions, researchers have focused on channels through which the housing market can affect the labor market. In a series of widely cited papers, Mian et al. (2013) and Mian and Sufi (2014) focus on the local demand channel arising out of changes in net worth.==== Mian and Sufi (2014) argue that changes in house prices would have a different impact on employment in industries which are driven by local demand compared to the ones which are driven by national demand. Using great-recession period data for a cross-section of counties in the U.S., they showed that reduced housing net worth led to significant job losses in the non-tradable sector but not in the tradable sector.==== The underlying idea is that employment in local industries, for example — restaurants, relies heavily on local demand, in contrast to industries that are driven by national or even international demand. Naturally, a deteriorating (improving) housing market condition reduces (increases) households’ net worth and consequently employment in non-tradable industries.====Building on the work of Mian and Sufi (2014) and Giroud and Mueller (2017) find that firms’ balance sheets were instrumental in the transmission of consumer demand shocks during the Great Recession. Using micro-level data from the U.S. Census Bureau, they find that the correlation between employment and local house prices is significantly stronger among establishments of more highly leveraged firms that are in the non-tradable sector. Under this mechanism, local demand channels arising due to changes in housing prices disproportionately affect firms that are more leveraged. Since the non-tradable sector cannot diversify the risk originating in the local market, employment level in this sector is more sensitive to house prices than the tradable sector.====One of the major challenges of cross-sectional studies that have focused on the great recession period is that they are unable to shed light on the dynamic impact of house prices on macroeconomy. With housing representing the biggest part of household wealth, changes in house price are a major source of business cycle fluctuations and changes in the housing market may persist for a significant amount of time. Housing market frictions arising due to high transaction costs and taxes as well as the specific structure of the mortgage market can lead to a drawn-out collapse of the housing market when the housing price cycle turns. The housing stock can also take a substantial amount of time to adjust in response to a demand shock. These frictions in the housing market were evident in the jobless recovery in the U.S. that took place after the great recession. It is important, therefore, to understand the relationship between the housing market and employment in a dynamic framework.====This paper seeks to fill this gap in the literature by examining the following questions: do house price shocks affect non-tradable employment more than tradable employment in a dynamic setting? How persistent are the effects of house price shocks on employment? Does the dynamic impact of house price on employment differ from those of income and building permits? We answer these questions in two steps. First, using a panel vector autoregression (PVAR) model, we investigate the relative magnitude and persistence of house price shock on tradable and non-tradable employment. While PVAR analysis is important to study the average dynamic effect of house prices, it is also important to study if a significant degree of heterogeneity exists across different states and if this relationship holds in an out-of-sample forecasting analysis. To do so, we examine the forecasting ability of house prices for tradable and non-tradable employment that takes into account the possible heterogeneity in the relationship between house prices and different types of employment across 45 different states in the U.S. using hand-constructed monthly data from 2001:M1 through 2019:M12. Creating a state-level time-series database for non-tradable and tradable employment is also one of the contributions of this paper.====Our PVAR model consists of four variables at the state level: tradable (non-tradable) employment, personal income, building permit, and house prices. Given sufficiently large time-series observations (T=234), we estimate this panel VAR model with state-level fixed effects. The PVAR model allows us to estimate and compare the impact of unexpected shocks to house price, building permits and income on different types of employment at different forecast horizons. To examine the predictive power of real house price growth for tradable and non-tradable employment, we obtain forecasts from vector autoregression (VAR) models that include real house price growth and examine if the inclusion of house price in a model with employment leads to an out-of-sample improvement in forecasts of tradable (non-tradable) employment growth.==== We also consider the possibility that the improvement in non-tradable employment forecasts may occur because of the direct demand channel and not necessarily related to the net worth channel arising out of the changes in the household’s balance sheet. To examine this possibility, we also undertake forecasting exercises of both types of employment using state-level real personal income growth and building permits as predictors. Finally, we examine whether the degree of predictability of tradable and non-tradable employment is related to the institutional features of the housing market of different states like housing supply elasticity and housing price volatility.====Key findings are as follows: First, the results from the PVAR model show that non-tradable employment responds more to house price shocks than tradable employment at different forecast horizons. This response is significant and persistent unlike the impact of shocks to income and building permits, where the response of different types of employment is very short-lived. Second, we find that improvement in forecasting performance of non-tradable employment is more than tradable employment in the majority of the states. Not only this superiority of forecasting performance holds for the average of h ==== 1–12 month of forecasting horizon, but is also true for specific forecasting horizons. There is significant heterogeneity in the degree of predictability of both types of employment across states. Third, we do not find superior forecasting performance for non-tradable employment growth in comparison to tradable employment growth when real income growth and housing building permits are used as predictors. This is consistent with aggregate PVAR results. Since changes in income and building permits are not associated with changes in household balance sheets, it is not surprising that we do not find the persistent effect of these variables on employment in our forecasting analysis. Finally, we find that states with inelastic housing supply tend to have a bigger difference in the predictability of non-tradable employment over tradable employment. In addition, states with highly volatile house prices also tend to have a bigger improvement in the forecast of non-tradable employment when house prices are used as a predictor.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a brief literature review; Section 3 provides a description of the data used in this paper; Section 4 presents the panel VAR model and forecasting results; and Section 5 concludes.",The local employment effect of house prices: Evidence from U.S. States,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137721000607,11 September 2021,2021,Research Article,58.0

Analytical tools that may help policy makers to spot a housing bubble before it grows dangerously big could therefore improve the basis for macroeconomic stabilization policy. This paper presents an empirical methodology for estimating whether a country’s level of house prices is out of line with fundamentals.====Our method for estimating fundamental house prices broadly follows the one developed by Hott and Monnin (2008) which is based on the dividend-discount model of asset prices pioneered by Campbell and Shiller, 1988b, Campbell and Shiller, 1988a. This model has been used recently and in different contexts to analyze housing markets by, i.a., Campbell et al. (2009), Costello et al. (2011), Hiebert and Sydow (2011), Hott and Jokipii (2012), the European Commission (2012), Ambrose et al. (2013), Fairchild et al. (2015) and Kishor and Morley (2015). An alternative approach is taken by Malpezzi (1999) who uses data for U.S. metropolitan areas to estimate a simple error-correction model of the dynamics of the house-price-to-income ratio, assuming that the long-run equilibrium value of this ratio is linearly dependent on a few fundamentals such as the mortgage interest rate, the stringency of zoning regulation and the levels and rates of change of population and real income. We see our approach as complementary to Malpezzi’s but prefer to base our empirics on the standard asset-pricing model with an explicit microeconomic foundation.====Our housing market model allows us to address the following questions: Do actual house prices converge on fundamental house prices? If so, how long does it take before a gap between the actual and the fundamental price is closed? How can one identify shocks to fundamental and actual house prices? And how can one calculate a confidence band for the estimate of the fundamental house price and how broad is that band?====While several of these issues have been studied in the previous literature, the main contribution of the present paper is to develop a unified vector error correction model that allows a rigorous test of various hypotheses regarding the interaction between actual and fundamental house prices as well as an identification of temporary and permanent shocks to the housing market. To illustrate how the model works, we apply it to a data set for Sweden. Our analysis indicates that the estimated fundamental house price works as an anchor for the actual house price, but it also suggests that actual house prices adjust rather slowly to fundamentals and may occasionally display bubble-like behavior.====The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the theoretical model of fundamental house prices. Section 3 describes the empirical strategy for modeling the forward-looking expectations determining fundamental house prices, and Section 4 explains how the fundamental house price may be calculated, once the formation of expectations has been modeled.

Using Korean Labor and Income Panel Study (KLIPS) data covering the period 1999-2016, we analyze tenure transitions made by owner occupiers on the cusp of homeownership. The Korean case is interesting because an asset-based rental lease type, known as ====, and monthly rental leases with varying amounts of deposit, comprise the vast majority of private rental options. Western-style monthly rental leases account for a very small market share. Paying close attention to the availability of these private rental contract types, we investigate tenure transition by homeowners exposed to competing risks in the aftermath of the GFC. Estimates from the Cox single-hazard model suggest that, other things being equal, the hazard of homeowners’ transiting to a rental lease during the crisis years is 32% larger than during the non-crisis period. We also find that the effects of the crisis on transitions out of ownership depend on the types of private rental arrangements available to homeowners. Finally, about 50% of the ex-homeowners are still renters by the end of the 4th year, falling to 30% by the end of the 10th year after exiting from homeownership.","Sustainable homeownership is widely (though not universally) regarded as a basis for the tenure security and social stability, as well as an important goal of housing policy.==== But the status of homeownership can be disrupted by negative shocks such as the loss of job and income. The 2008-2009 Global Financial Crisis (GFC) had a significant impact on the housing markets in many advanced economies and emerging economies (Aalbers, 2010; Case and Quigley, 2010; Kim and Renaud, 2009; and Sanders, 2008). Economic crises expose homeowners to two types of risks; credit risk, i.e., difficulty in meeting mortgage payments, and investment risk, i.e. unanticipated declines in housing equity (Smith et al., 2009). Substantial research has been carried out on the former, but the latter has received little attention in the literature (Smith, 2012), even though both can precipitate a loss of home ownership. A focus on credit risk is understandable since it was a key factor in the GFC. In contrast, there have been only a few microeconomic studies on the effects of a credit crunch on tenure transition out of homeownership (See Forrest and Murie (1994); Wood et al. (2013)).====This study analyzes of homeowners’ risks and resultant moves out of homeownership due to economic hardship using a household level panel dataset from Korea. Specifically, we investigate tenure transitions of marginal homeowners who are most likely to transit out of ownership during the economic shocks associated with the GFC.====We specify a competing risk model that has previously been applied to mortgage terminations to analyze the behavior of homeowners transiting to renting. Standard survival analysis deals with a single event or failure. In some of the housing literature a homeowner's move out of ownership to renting is treated as a single event, as in Dieleman et al. (1995), Haurin and Rosenthal (2004), Turner and Smith (2009), and Helderman (2007). We argue that the competing risk approach is advantageous when an event can result in one of several (rather than a single) outcomes.==== Deng et al. (2000) and Henley (1998) apply such competing risk models to analyze mortgage termination and residential mobility, respectively.====When homeowners in Korea must “climb down the housing ladder” from homeownership, they can do so by choosing from either of two polar types of rental tenure, as well as a hybrid continuum the two poles. This is in contrast to the U.S. and the majority of countries where monthly rental is the only alternative to homeownership.==== The baseline tenure type for home owning households is, of course, homeownership, purchased with or without a mortgage and with property rights broadly similar to those in other OECD countries. The most common alternative to homeownership, ====, is often referred to as a rental tenure because the tenant does not own the property; but the financial arrangement is different from the monthly rental payment common in other OECD countries. Under a chonsei contract, a tenant pays an upfront deposit to the landlord and does not pay monthly rent during the lease period. The deposit is returned in full at the termination of the lease contract. The amount of deposit is typically larger than 50% of the value of a house, although the ratio varies across location and house type as well as over time. The returned deposit can be used later as a down payment for home purchase as the tenant tries to move up the housing ladder to become a homeowner.====Thus, chonsei is a version of antichresis, a financial arrangement in which a debtor pledges immovable real property to a creditor, wherein the creditor has certain usufruct rights. Specifically, the tenant is the creditor who lends the chonsei amount to the debtor landlord. Put another way, the landlord borrows the money from the renter/creditor; the property is the security for the loan, and the tenant receives the use of the property in lieu of interest payments. The landlord will normally invest the chonsei amount in some financial instrument; when the household's tenure ends, the landlord returns the chonsei principal to the tenant, retaining the investment proceeds obtained during that tenure.====Antichresis has a long history going back at least to ancient Greece. It is far from the most common form of housing tenure around the globe, but it can be found in several European and Latin American countries(Navaro and Turnbull, 2010) in some transactions with respect to aged care homes in Australia, and some cities in India (Gilbert 2003). In the United States, Louisiana has a legal system that incorporates aspects of the Napoleonic Code; this system provides a framework for antichresis transactions, though these do not appear to be common in practice.====As mentioned above, there are other types of tenancy contracts in Korea. One other type of rental lease is a monthly rental contract that also entails an up-front deposit, but much larger than a security deposit in a Western rental lease.==== There is also a whole array of rental leases with varying amounts of deposit and monthly rents, referred to locally as ==== During the contract period, a tenant pays monthly rent to fill the gap between the deposit for a monthly rental lease and the deposit that would be required for a comparable chonsei contract. The interest rate used to convert the up-front deposit to monthly rent, known as ‘the conversion rate’, varies depending on the location, size, and type of property.====During a credit crunch or other period of economic hardship, marginal homeowners at risk of unemployment or income and housing value shocks, are exposed to higher risks of transiting out of homeownership.==== Marginal Korean homeowners will plausibly prefer a chonsei lease to a monthly rental lease. The main reason is that the user cost is lower for chonsei than for a monthly lease with a deposit, because the conversion rate is much higher than the market interest rate.==== Since chonsei is a better option for the tenant as long as she can mobilize funds to pay for a sizeable deposit (Cho, 2012, Kim, 2013; and Ronald and Jin, 2015), we describe a homeowner's move to a chonsei as ==== the housing ladder (a softer landing) and a homeowner's move to a monthly rental lease as ==== the housing ladder (a harder landing) throughout the paper.====Our key empirical findings are as follows. First, we apply the standard survival model; these results suggest that the risks of moving out of homeownership increased in Korea during the GFC of 2008-09. For comparison, Wood et al. (2013) find mixed evidence of the effects of the GFC on tenure transition into the rental sector in Australia and the UK; Australian homeowners seem to have been largely unaffected by the GFC, whereas British homeowners have been negatively affected. We find Korean homeowners as a group have been unambiguously negatively affected by the GFC.====Next, we estimate two competing risk models, the cause-specific hazard (CSH) model and the hazard of subdistribution (HoS) model. Results from these models confirm that the incidence of moving out of ownership increases with the GFC for both the owners who move to a chonsei lease and those who move to a monthly rental lease. These findings from Korea may provide insights on other housing markets where there is more than one rental option. For example, many European housing markets have a sizeable social housing sector operating alongside a private rental market (UNECE, 2015).====Thirdly, by taking competing risks into account, we find that the risk of walking down the housing ladder increased in the post-GFC period, while increased risks due to other causes during the period are not always robust. To the best of our knowledge, this paper represents the first attempt to estimate the marginal (or net) effects of competing risks on tenure transition out of homeownership, controlling for competing risks that interact with one another.==== The GFC produced large negative impacts on both types of transitions by marginal homeowners, i.e., falling off the ladder and walking down the ladder.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief overview of the literature on transition out of homeownership and of the Korean housing market. Section 3 presents an empirical analysis based on a single risk model and two competing risk models using the data from the Korea Labor and Income Panel Study (KLIPS) for the period 1999-2016. In addition, it provides empirical evidence of the impact of the GFC on tenure transitions out of homeownership.

Each government school within NSW has a designated intake zone and students residing within this area are guaranteed admission. Although government schools may accept enrolments from outside their designated zone, a school’s enrolment capacity is generally fulfilled by enrolling only those students who reside in the school’s catchment area. This is especially the case for high-performing public schools. With limited admission into high-performing schools, the capitalization of school quality into the price of houses in high-performing public school zones is inevitable.====The willingness of parents to pay a premium on property to secure their child’s enrolment into a high-performing school is widely documented in the literature. Many studies in the United States (US) and United Kingdom (UK) have attempted to quantify this premium by, for example, coupling the boundary fixed effects (BFE) analysis with other estimation strategies. This paper innovates over existing studies by combining two recent econometric techniques; the boundary discontinuity and regression discontinuity design methods, to quantify this premium in New South Wales (Australia). With the exception of Davidoff and Leigh (2008), this topic is yet to be formally addressed in Australia using appropriate recent econometric techniques. To the best of our knowledge, we are not aware of an Australian study that investigates rigorously the relationship between primary school zoning and housing prices using the combination of the boundary discontinuity design (BDD) strategy of Black (1999) and the regression discontinuity design (RDD) framework.====The BFE method was introduced by Black (1999) in this context to address concerns arising from the fact that better schools tend to be located in affluent neighbourhoods, and students drawn from these ‘privileged’ socioeconomic backgrounds generally have higher academic achievement. A key assumption of the BFE strategy is that houses located near school attendance boundaries and sufficiently close to one another share the same neighbourhood characteristics, therefore once house characteristics have been controlled for, any difference in house prices across boundaries is attributable to school quality (Black, 1999) or sorting on the boundary. Restricting the sample to housing sales located within 250 metres of an attendance boundary, Black (1999) finds that a 5% increase in primary school test scores (about one standard deviation) leads to a 2.5% increase in house prices.====Since this seminal work of Black (1999), a number of studies have coupled the BFE technique with additional controls relating to socio-economic characteristics, such as household income. In doing so, studies like Kane et al. (2005) and Bayer et al. (2007) have established a greater fall in the estimated impact of school test scores on housing prices compared to Black (1999). Fack and Grenet (2010) improve the BFE estimation strategy by incorporating it into a matching framework under which identical properties across school admission boundaries are matched. In addition to Fack and Grenet’s (2010) matching framework, Gibbons et al. (2013) also propose to control for spatial trends==== in the BFE model.====Fack and Grenet (2010) explore the extent to which housing prices react to the quality of education offered by neighbouring public and private secondary schools. They establish that a one-standard deviation increase in public school performance raises house prices by 1.4% to 2.4% in Paris (France). Their most remarkable finding is that increased access to private schools tend to mitigate the impact of public school performance on housing prices. Unlike Fack and Grenet (2010), the focus of this study and many existing other is solely on public primary schools. Therefore, secondary public school choice and the variation in secondary public school assignments are not captured, thus the estimates on the capitalization of public school performance on housing prices could be biased downwards, particularly when households on either side of the boundary do not share a secondary school. From this perspective, our results provide lower bounds on the impact of public school performance on housing prices in NSW. This highlights an avenue for future research whereby, adopting our joint BDD & RDD approach, one would simultaneously examine the primary and secondary public school attendance zoning effect on house prices, upon controlling for access to private schooling. A widespread of important recent studies on this topic have proposed border fixed effects/distance approaches. This includes but not restricted to Bonilla-Mejía et al., 2020, Chan et al., 2020, Brehm et al., 2017 and Andreyeva and Patrick (2017).====The RDD has been widely used in empirical studies and is considered the most credible non-experimental strategy within the casual inference framework (Calonico et al., 2018). Its reliance on weak non-parametric identifying assumptions enables flexible and robust estimation and inference for local treatment effects (Calonico et al., 2018). The BDD is a special case of RDD. Embedding the BDD into the data selection procedure, we consider only those housing sales close to and on either side of a school attendance boundary, upon maintaining the BFE key assumption (i.e., houses located near school attendance boundaries and sufficiently close to one another share the same neighbourhood characteristics). Although maintaining this assumption addresses a number of endogeneity concerns, it does not address the possibility of high-income households sorting into high-performing school zones. Such sorting may contribute to higher average house prices in performing school zones since high-income households are more likely to invest in property improvements. Due to data limitation, we could not formally address this selection problem. However, we have controlled for neighbourhood characteristics (including the median high and low suburbs’ income) throughout all our estimations.====Our joint BDD and RDD identification strategy provides clearly a useful insight on the capitalization of school performance into house prices in Australia in general, and New South Wales in particular. We find that on average the price of a house located in a high-performing primary school zone is approximately 2.5% to 3.6% higher than a similar house in a lower-performing zone. To enable comparison with the existing literature, Table 1.1 below summarizes the estimated effects of school quality on house price from seven prior studies. All the estimates measure the effect of a one-standard deviation increase in school quality on house prices, thus enabling for a direct comparison across studies.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.

Local factors such as supply availability and valuation proxies are found to be significantly associated with future downside risks to major housing markets, but their effect varies across cities and time horizons. We find important spatial dependence in housing risks, with overvaluation in nearby cities increasing downside risks to house prices in a given city. Additionally, macro-financial drivers such as household debt, capital flows, and financial conditions play a key role in forecasting ==== risks. Using micro-level data from California, we highlight the heterogeneity of tail risks across counties and the role played by local factors in forecasting housing risks.","House prices play a major role in assessing financial stability and monitoring systemic risk. A sharp deterioration of housing markets can have severe adverse effects on household balance sheets, business confidence, and on banks’ ability to lend. These effects can spill over across borders due to increasingly synchronized housing cycles. The collapse of the U.S. housing market in 2008 sent the global economy into a lasting period of financial turbulence, leading to the largest crisis since the Great Depression. Examining current economic conditions can help identify risks associated with house prices and the underlying drivers of these tail risks.====There is a wide literature examining the relationship between housing markets and household wealth, as well as its impact on the business cycle. A decrease in house prices coincides with a decrease in household’s perceived wealth and, in turn, is followed by a decline in consumption (Campbell and Cocco, 2007, Mian and Sufi, 2016). Moreover, high household debt hinders the ability of households to combat exogenous shocks such as a sudden increase in interest rates or a loss in income, which would ultimately be reflected in a decline in private consumption during an economic downturn. Thus, it is necessary to identify the main drivers and tail risks to house prices in order to prepare for potential vulnerabilities to household wealth.====Numerous academic studies have found that house price valuation is linked to a variety of macroeconomic and structural factors. House prices are found to be highly correlated with supply factors and real interest rates (Agnello and Schuknecht, 2011, Grimes and Aitken, 2010). Furthermore, macroprudential and monetary policy measures are important drivers of house prices through various transmission channels such as credit availability, housing demand, and balance sheet effects. Rental yields, capital flows, household income and leverage each have an additional influence on housing valuation (Capozza et al., 2002, Duca et al., 2011).====Along with influencing house price valuations, household debt has significant economy-wide implications. Housing markets in highly leveraged areas appear to be more vulnerable to income shocks (Lamont and Stein, 1997). Excessive levels of household debt also negatively impact future GDP growth in the medium and long term, primarily due to debt overhang effects (Mian et al., 2017). Residential real estate makes up a notable portion of household wealth, which in turn makes household wealth vulnerable to the volatility of house prices. A sharp and unexpected decrease in house prices impacts household’s ability to borrow and consume through wealth and collateral effects.====While country-level analysis gives an adequate overview of the overall state of the housing markets in a particular economy, it is unable to capture the vast idiosyncrasies of each individual housing market within that economy. At the aggregate level, housing valuation in the U.S. remained relatively stable between 2012 and 2019, fluctuating around the long-term average, while in Canada the housing market was about 30 percent overvalued as of 2018Q3 (Fig. 1). However, housing markets vary substantially across cities, as highlighted and corroborated in several studies. Even within cities, house prices react to shocks heterogeneously (Guerrieri et al., 2012). Identifying potential price bubbles in housing markets can have important implications on the health of an economy as a whole. Typically asset bubbles are supported by loose financial conditions and debt buildup, and thus the formation of a bubble followed by a sharp price correction can have a significant impact on household wealth, consumption, and on the overall economy.====To deepen our understanding, we take a closer look at house prices in major metropolitan areas in the U.S. and Canada. The main questions addressed in this paper are: (1) How do downside risks to house prices vary across cities in the U.S. and Canada? (2) What is the role of local factors in predicting tail risks to house prices? (3) Are risks to housing markets spatially dependent?====We dissect these questions by analyzing future downside risks to housing markets across a wide range of cities in the U.S. and Canada building on the methodology developed by Adrian et al. (2019). Our main sample includes quarterly data from 37 cities in Canada and the U.S. between 1983 to 2018.==== In the first stage, quantile regressions are estimated for each city to model the nonlinear relationship between various city- and country-level indicators and housing market vulnerabilities. This allows us to capture the contribution of specific variables at different parts of the forecast distribution. In the second stage, we smooth the conditional forecast distribution by fitting a skewed t-distribution to the predicted values at each quantile, which were obtained in the first stage. The left tail of the conditional distribution, or the lower fifth percentile is considered the house prices-at-risk (HaR hereafter) metric for a given city at each point in time. Intuitively, this metric can be considered as a good proxy for the downside risks to future house prices.====In a complementing study, Deghi et al. (2020) analyze downside risks to future real house prices in 32 countries, using aggregate data. They show that the house prices-at-risk metric is important in improving forecasts of financial crises and future downside risks to output growth. In contrast to our paper, Deghi et al. (2020) focus on house prices across countries which can pose additional methodological challenges due to differences in the construction of country-specific house price indices. Moreover, their aggregate analysis in a pooled econometric setup masks important heterogeneity, which could be relevant for policy decisions. Conversely, we focus on the variation across cities within the same country, where prices, local determinants, and other factors are homogeneously constructed and directly comparable.====A key contribution of this paper lies in the granularity of the city-level analysis through a novel framework which allows us to identify risk factors at different stages of the housing cycle using a quantile regression model. To pinpoint any disparities between city-level house price risks, we estimate each city model univariately. This enables us to measure the distinct sensitives of each city’s housing market to different drivers of risk, allowing the identification of certain risk factors which may be obscured at the aggregate level. To truly grasp the level of HaR, it is imperative to consider endogenous factors that vary at the city-level and account for fundamental differences between housing markets. In addition, we investigate the variation of housing market risks at the micro-level, focusing on the 40 largest counties in California.====In considering sub-national markets, we must also take into account spatial characteristics (Liao and Wang, 2012, Osland, 2010). Thus, a second contribution of this paper is the extension of the empirical methodology to account for spatial dependence between cities. First, we test each pair of cities for the potential existence of spatial dependence. After identifying blocks of spatially dependent housing markets, we account for local factors such as valuation and housing supply in other cities to improve the prediction model of downside risks. More specifically, a quantile regression model augmented with spatial-lagged local factors is developed. This provides valuable insights into the complex interconnections between housing markets, allowing us to capture the effect of any exogenous factors impacting city-level housing markets.====Our main findings are threefold. First, house price risks and their determinants vary depending on the time horizon and across cities. In the short term, tighter financial conditions are detrimental to house price risks, while the effect dampens in the long term. Similarly, household leverage is associated with ameliorating short-term house price risks, while exacerbating them in the long term.==== Capital flows are also significantly associated with future downside risks to key residential housing markets, though the net effect varies across cities depending on the types of flows and the horizon.====Second, local factors such as city-specific valuation and housing supply are found to be influential determinants of future downside risks to housing markets. Additionally, downside risks to house prices vary substantially even at the micro-level (i.e., across counties within a state), stressing the importance of monitoring local dynamics to spot house price vulnerabilities. Interestingly, a higher sensitivity to the valuation proxy is associated with more significant downside risks in the future. Thus, we conclude that local factors matter considerably when detecting and assessing vulnerabilities to housing markets.====Third, the HaR methodology is extended in several directions. For instance, we employ formal tests to examine the existence of spatial dependence across cities, revealing the importance of spatial characteristics primarily for U.S. cities. Moreover, when spatially-weighted local factors are introduced in the HaR model and are found to be significant, the forecasting accuracy, measured by the pseudo ====, improves by about 5 percentage points.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the conceptual framework, Section 3 provides stylized facts, Section 4 presents an overview of the data and empirical analysis, Section 5 disseminates empirical findings, and Section 6 concludes.",Local house-price vulnerability: Evidence from the U.S. and Canada,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137721000413,4 August 2021,2021,Research Article,65.0

A recent experience in the City of Buenos Aires from the sanction of a law of this type has characteristics of a quasi-experiment, allowing the study of the causal effects of this policy on rental prices and related contractual conditions. In order to identify this effect, I propose exploiting the differences in the geographic discontinuity along the city limit. I find an increase in average rents of a magnitude consistent with the theoretical result that owners transfer the value of the commission to tenants but distributed throughout the contract. In other words, it is consistent with a financing effect, where the commission is financed throughout the contract. I also find suggestive evidence indicating owners changed their security deposit requirements, probably to ==== the commission.","In a growing number of cities, governments have been incorporating new regulations into the housing rental market. As a response to what is widely seen as a housing affordability crisis, regulations have sought to benefit tenants. In England, for example, the “Tenant Fees Act”, which came into force in June 2019, banned landlords and agents from charging for a number of fees.==== In Berlin, the city government passed a law that includes a temporary freeze on rents for five years from 2020.==== Similar measures have been passed in New York,==== and nationwide in Spain.====One example of these regulations consists in freeing tenants from paying the real estate (brokerage) commission, while transferring the obligation to landlords. While the objective of this policy is to reduce the cost of entry for tenants, it has also been questioned the extent in which such a measure would be effective. The main concern is that landlords could transfer the commission to the rent price, canceling out the intended effect.====Obtaining causal evidence on the effects of such regulations on rent prices is not trivial. Comparing rents across cities could confound the policy effect with other developments occurring in the rental markets, such as urban renewal processes, and could be subject to selection biases. A recent experience in the Buenos Aires rental market serves as a quasi-experiment, which allows me to disentangle the effect of interest. Specifically, in 2017, the legislature of the City of Buenos Aires passed a law that transferred the real estate commission payment obligation to landlords. The City of Buenos Aires is located at the center of the Buenos Aires urban agglomerate, and it is surrounded by a large, urbanized area under the jurisdiction of the Province of Buenos Aires. There is also a rent gradient, with rents increasing as properties are closer to the City center, and a discontinuity in the city limit, resulting from time-persistent jurisdictional effects. In identifying the effects of the law, I therefore propose examining how this discontinuity in rental prices (and other contractual conditions) changed with the introduction of the law.====This approach combines ideas of a Geographic Regression Discontinuity (GRD) (Keele and Titiunik, 2016) and a difference-in-differences estimator. In the paper I discuss the necessary assumptions for the identification of the average causal effect on the properties along the limit. I also show that the city limit is extensive enough to encompass a variety of areas and significant related variability in terms of rental prices. For this purpose, I extend the identification idea to recover the specific effects along the border and discuss the necessary assumptions and related estimation techniques. The resulting curve of effects allows a richer understanding of the effects of the law.====I start the paper by theoretically exploring the question of what to expect from a law that changes the obligation of who should pay the commission. In first place, I show that if the regulation transfers the obligation to the landlord – without changes to the commission itself –, then rents will increase but there will be no associated welfare effect. The magnitude of the rent increase will respond to a passthrough effect that will restore the previous equilibrium. Interestingly, the magnitude of such passthrough, will respond to a financial effect: Since the commission is paid only once at the beginning of the contract, but the landlord has the entire contract to transfer a charge to the tenant, the net effect on the rent will depend on the length of the contract and the temporal discount rate.====Second, if a new regulation determines changes to the commission ====, as could be the case with policies capping the level of the commission, then rents will respond according to the relative elasticities of supply and demand, moderated by the mentioned financial effect. Commission reductions (or increases) will imply decreases (increases) in rents according to the underlying elasticities, and in a magnitude that will be also moderated by the mentioned financial effect.====Based on these insights, I then calibrate a theoretical prediction for the change in rents resulting from the law passed in Buenos Aires and contrast these predictions to the empirical results. I find that rent asking prices increase, and the average magnitude is remarkably close to what the theoretical explanation proposes. As result, the evidence seems consistent with the idea that the law had the effect of increasing rents but to reestablish the previous equilibrium, in a magnitude consistent with the absence of welfare effects in present value terms. While I cannot completely rule out some alternative channels, such as for example, that the policy (also) generated an increase in demand in the City, the evidence provided in the paper is less supportive to this alternative hypothesis.====I also find a significant degree of variability of effects along the limit. Rental price increases have been, in general, larger in areas with lower rental values. In the highest rental values areas, the policy shows not statistically different from zero effects. The pattern of higher effects in lower rental value areas can be explained with the proposed theoretical explanation if owners of low rental value apartments are also those with higher discount factors.====In addition, I find suggestive evidence indicating that owners responded by asking a higher advance payment in the form of a security deposit. While the standard asked deposit in this market is the equivalent of a one-month rent, I find that the share of advertisements asking the standard deposit reduced, indicating that many owners have changed their deposit requirement. This finding reinforces the idea that, whenever possible, some owners will increase the security deposit into financing the commission.====This paper contributes to the literature studying policy instruments in the housing rental market, particularly with respect to commission regulation.==== Despite of a common tendency in policy papers of warning against the possible null effects of regulations such as those transferring the obligation, I could not find papers identifying these effects empirically. A few theoretical articles discuss the role of the brokerage fee or related policies in the rental market. Inderst (2015), for example, argues that capping or regulating commissions may have adverse welfare effects on the market, since intermediaries steer recommendations to more efficient products. Niedermayer and Wang (2018) show that landlords can use the willingness to pay the commission as a device to distinguish between short term and long-term tenants, and in that sense, a policy of the type would decrease efficiency by preventing this type of screening, at the time that will also increase the turnover in the market.====While in the literature that studies the microstructure of housing markets, the payment of the commission has been analyzed from the point of view of incentives to agents (Han and Strange, 2015, Bar-Isaac and Gavazza, 2015), the literature for rental markets seems to have put less attention on the question of who should pay the commission. This paper contributes to the literature by providing theoretical predictions for changes in rental prices as response to a regulation transferring the obligation, and in the case of changing commission requirements. The case of Buenos Aires also provides evidence consistent in magnitude to what the theory proposes. Importantly, the paper highlights that the magnitude of the passthrough will respond to the financial conditions in the market.====In terms of the methodology used in the paper, there are a few studies in the urban economics literature that implement identification strategies based on boundaries, such as for valuing amenities (Gibbons et al., 2013), transport infrastructure effects (Bardaka et al., 2018, Diao et al., 2017) or estimating the effects of local taxes (Duranton et al., 2011). The identification strategy I propose – to exploit the differences in the geographic discontinuity –, draws from the geographic discontinuity design (Keele and Titiunik, 2016), and Regression Discontinuity (RD) literature in economics in general (Imbens and Lemieux, 2008, Lee and Lemieux, 2010, Cattaneo et al., 2019c). At least two previous studies, by Dachis et al. (2012) and Severen and Plantinga (2018), have exploited similar strategies to the case of identifying land use regulation effects.==== In this paper I provide a detailed discussion of the underlying identification assumptions, and propose an original estimation strategy for the effects along the geographic discontinuity, including a robust method for the estimation of standard errors.====I start by describing the main characteristics of the law passed in the City of Buenos Aires.

Homeowners are concerned that this shift in housing tenure will lower their neighborhood's quality and have an adverse effect on their property values. However, no current evidence exists on whether these concerns have any validity. In this paper, we utilize a six-year balanced panel of neighborhoods from the state of Florida's metropolitan areas to study the impacts that single-family rentals have on the values of single-family homes. Our case for causality is buttressed by estimating house value models that include time and neighborhood fixed effects, treat the rentals as endogenous variables, and control for sample selection and changes in neighborhood demographics and land uses. Our results show that share increases in single-family rentals lower house values, but the effects vary between central cities and suburbs, across neighborhoods of different income levels and density, by the price of the rental unit, and whether the owner has a mailing address outside the state of Florida.","Within many of America's traditional single-family neighborhoods, housing tenure has been shifting from owner-occupancy to rentals. Fig. 1, Fig. 2 show the upward climb in the total number of rentals and as a percentage of the single-family housing stock from 2005 to 2017 for the nation and the state of Florida, respectively.==== At the national level, the rental percentage has climbed roughly 4 percentage points, from 13% to 17%. Particularly strong has been Florida's growth in rentals, with an increase of 7 percentage points, from 13% to 20%.==== The impetus behind these shifts in favor of rentals originated over a decade ago as bank owned properties from the foreclosure crisis were purchased by investors and subsequently rented out. Today, the single-family rental market remains strong as many households opt in favor of renting over purchasing (Joint Center for Housing Studies, 2017). The rise in single-family rentals within their neighborhood has concerned many homeowners, who believe that their property values may be in jeopardy. These concerns have frequently been voiced in media reports (for example, Fottrell 2013, Dewan 2013, Schmit 2012, and Yoder 2012). In response, a growing number of local governments and Homeowners Associations are placing limits on the number of neighborhood single-family rentals (Yoder, 2012) or devising other programs to reduce their number.==== Constraints on the supply of single-family rentals may reduce social welfare. Households preferring to rent may find it harder to find what they want in a tighter rental market and housing affordability may suffer within higher-quality neighborhoods, exacerbating racial and income segregation.==== Hence, it is important to determine whether homeowner concerns surrounding the growth in single-family rentals are grounded in reality. To our knowledge, there is no current evidence on this issue.====We utilize a six-year balanced panel of neighborhoods from Florida's metropolitan areas to study the impacts that single-family rentals have on the values of single-family homes.==== Changes in housing values for 2788 neighborhoods, yielding 16,728 neighborhood/year observations, are measured over the years 2013–2018 using the Federal Housing Finance Agency's (FHFA) House Price Index (HPI) for census tracts. The natural log of the HPI is regressed on single-family rentals as a percentage of the neighborhood's housing units, along with the percentage of other housing units. The percentage of single-family owner-occupied homes serves as the excluded reference category. The estimated models control for sample selection, treat single-family rentals as endogenous, and along with year and tract fixed effects include an extensive set of control variables describing the demographics and non-residential properties within the neighborhood.

Using a rich panel of Australian microlevel data, we estimated the effect of housing price changes on both fertility intentions and fertility outcomes. The analysis indicates that the likelihood of having a child among homeowners is positively related to an increase in housing wealth. The positive housing wealth effect has the greatest impact on the fertility and fertility intentions of Australian homeowners who are young and mortgage holders. In comparison, there is evidence that increases in housing prices decrease the fertility intentions of private renters with children.","The large and sustained increase in housing prices and housing wealth across a range of developed countries has initiated interest in the behavioural implications of such developments. A series of studies have examined how such changes have impacted the well-being and behavior of individuals across several dimensions, including household consumption and divorce.==== Given that housing potentially constitutes a major cost of raising a child, one aspect of behavior that has received increasing attention is fertility. The interest in the relationship between housing prices and fertility is motivated in part by large declines in fertility experienced across a range of developed countries over the past three decades. In Australia, for example, the total fertility rate has been below the replacement rate since the late 1970s, while the real price of housing has more than tripled during the same period (OECD 2018a, 2018b). In this paper, we investigate this relationship by considering the impact of housing prices on fertility intentions and outcomes and the potential heterogeneity in behavior across households.====The analysis in this paper is grounded in the economic approach to fertility introduced by Becker (1960). In that study, the notion of a quality-quantity trade-off is developed, and such a framework is useful for understanding why fertility rates may have declined across developed countries over the past few decades. If children are normal goods and the income elasticity of demand for quality exceeds the income elasticity for the number of children, higher income will be associated with substitution away from quantity in favor of child quality. The literature also highlights how the cost of children may impact fertility choices. These costs include the opportunity cost of children, which may be affected by economic conditions such as unemployment, along with the explicit costs of raising children (Becker 1965; Mincer 1963). One component of the cost associated with raising children that has attracted attention is that of housing (Aksoy 2016; Clark and Ferrer 2016; Dettling and Kearney 2014; Lovenheim and Mumford 2013). Australian (Henman 2007) and international (Lino 2014) evidence indicates that housing costs represent one of the largest, if not the largest, components associated with raising children, and this relationship is considered in this paper.====This paper contributes to the existing international literature that seeks to identify the nature of the nexus between housing markets and fertility-related decisions. Existing research has considered evidence from the United Kingdom (Aksoy 2016), Canada (Clark and Ferrer 2016) and the United States (Dettling and Kearney 2014; Lovenheim and Mumford 2013). Using a rich longitudinal dataset from Australia, we exploit temporal and geographic variation in housing prices to examine how fertility decisions are related to changes in housing wealth using a similar approach to that of Lovenheim and Mumford (2013). This paper adds to the existing research in several dimensions. Notably, we examine not only realized fertility but also how fertility intentions respond to changes in house prices. Understanding fertility intentions is important for at least two reasons. First, such an analysis has the advantage of capturing the long-term planning of fertility events (Vidal et al., 2017), and second, fertility intentions can be less susceptible to external factors such as miscarriages and unplanned pregnancies (Risse 2010). To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the effect of housing prices on fertility intentions. The analysis also provides insight into the Australian context, where housing costs are likely to be important for fertility decisions due to their relative salience and the central role of housing in the tax and transfer system.====The empirical results indicate that an AUD$100,000 increase in housing wealth among homeowners is associated with an 18 percent increase in the probability of having a child. In contrast, private renters with children report lower fertility intentions in response to house price inflation in the local housing market. Furthermore, there is evidence of heterogeneity in the housing price effect according to marital status, parental status, family income, homeownership status, and the nature of liquidity constraints faced by households.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section, a brief review of the theoretical and empirical literature that examines the relationship between housing markets and fertility decisions is presented. A discussion of the Australian institutional environment is presented to provide some context to the analysis. The data used in the analysis are described in section three, followed by the empirical specifications in section four. Section five contains the estimation results, including the main effects, robustness assessments.

An example of local spillovers are the negative effects of foreclosures on house values in the immediate neighborhood (Lin et al., 2009, Daneshvary et al., 2011). Regional spillover effects are tied to the diffusion of economic activity (Oikarinen, 2004, Holly et al., 2011), the impact of regulations (Li et al., 2019), or natural disasters (Bauer et al., 2017, McCoy and Walsh, 2018); and they may vary over time, in particular before and after the housing market crash of 2007–2008 (Cohen et al., 2016). The point of most of these types of spillover studies is to uncover or quantify price changes beyond those objects that are directly affected by an event or trend. This can be of significant interest because spillover effects may reveal unexpected or unintended consequences, with possible policy implications.====In this study, we consider spillover effects from a different perspective, as a potentially serious issue in causal impact analyses that rely on a control unit approach, such as the difference-in-differences (DiD) framework. As is well known, to successfully analyze the impact of an exogenous event with a DiD or similar design, one requirement is that the control unit is unaffected by the treatment.==== We examine a case involving two real estate markets in the Southern U.S. where this requirement is not fulfilled, although the two markets appear good candidates for a DiD type approach because they have well matching characteristics.====The two markets we examine are potentially tied to each other via spillover effects through the presence of competing employers in the automotive sector. The treated unit is the real estate market around VW’s only U.S. plant in Chattanooga, TN; the potential control unit is the real estate market around BMW’s only U.S. plant in Spartanburg, SC. In September of 2015, VW is subject to an unexpected negative news event (diesel emissions scandal) that initially puts into question the very survival of the world’s second largest automotive company.==== As argued by Kirchhain et al. (2020), the sudden specter of large-scale job and income losses for workers at VW’s Chattanooga, TN, plant, its suppliers and the surrounding community reduced housing demand and depressed, with a lag, prices in the local housing market. As the uncertainty about VW’s survival and its local investment plans lifted, housing demand and prices reversed course.====If one intended to use a DiD analysis to verify the results for the Chattanooga real estate market, the Spartanburg real estate market, about 200 miles due east of the VW plant, would appear to be a good choice because many of its characteristics match those of the Chattanooga market. In this study, however, we argue that VW’s emissions scandal spilled over into the Spartanburg market and, therefore, disqualifies it as a useful control. Our hypothesis of spillover effects is grounded in the fact that the two housing markets, VW’s U.S. home market in Chattanooga and BMW’s in Spartanburg, are linked via the significant degree of competition that exists between these two German car companies. Whether the spillover effect is positive or negative in this particular case is difficult to pin down a priori. A negative contagion effect of the VW scandal on the housing market in Spartanburg is possible if (a) issues similar to those of VW were anticipated also for BMW or (b) a general backlash against German automobile companies was expected to follow from the VW scandal with potentially sizable losses in sales and jobs also around Spartanburg.==== Conversely, a positive spillover effect for the Spartanburg housing market is conceivable based on the expectation that VW’s massive problems would significantly lower the competitive pressure for BMW.====Based on approximately 7500 house transactions in the county of Spartanburg, our estimation results indicate a ==== impact on house prices 61 to 90 days after the VW announcement. The price effect ranges between 4.6% to 5.1%, which is remarkably similar in size and timing, but opposite in sign, to the price effects reported by Kirchhain et al. (2020) for the home market of VW’s U.S. production plant in Chattanooga. Had a difference-in-difference approach been used to identify the impact of VW’s scandal announcement on home prices in Chattanooga, with the Spartanburg market as control unit, the calculated impact would have been twice as large as the one reported in Kirchhain et al. (2020). We conclude that neglected spillover effects can significantly impact causal impact analyses also in the context of real estate markets.====The study is organized as follows. Section 2 provides background information on the VW emissions scandal and the role of spillover effects in trying to find the impact of the VW scandal announcement on house prices in the real estate market of Chattanooga. Methodology and data are presented in Section 3; the results follow in Section 4, and Section 5 provides some conclusions.",Spillover effects of company news across real estate markets and causal impact analysis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137721000358,17 June 2021,2021,Research Article,71.0

We utilize a sample of 18 real estate markets covering four decades and find that the U.K. and the U.S. are the largest transmitters. In contrast, France, followed by Italy, Finland, and Ireland, are the heaviest recipients of return shocks. We notice a sharp spike and upward trend in spillovers after GFC, followed by the European sovereign debt crisis and the recent Brexit episodes. Importantly, we report that bilateral trade linkages foster pair-wise return spillovers. Our findings suggest that positive economic sentiments and bullish periods in other asset classes ease return spillovers. The presence of dynamics in return spillovers during stable and stress periods is insightful in return predictability and devising effective investment strategies. Our overall results are robust to several sensitivity checks.","Real estate markets are leading indicators of the aggregate economy, playing a seminal role in shaping economies (Quigley, 2001). A case in point is the recent Global Financial Crisis of 2007/2008 (hereafter, GFC) triggered by sub-prime mortgages’ collapse. Real estate markets are reputed as reliable and risk diversifying assets with a somewhat guaranteed price stability or appreciation (Conover et al., 2002; Fugazza et al., 2009). The benefits of including real estate in a mixed-asset portfolio are also well-documented. These benefits are further advanced by investing in international real estate markets (Case et al., 2000; Eichholtz, 1996). However, real estate market volatilities are not autonomous (de Bandt et al., 2010; Kim and Park, 2016; Vansteenkiste and Hiebert, 2011). It is proven that international real estate markets tend to co-move.====Co-movements in international real estate markets could generate spillovers in the presence of robust dynamics in country-specific real estate market advancements. The general expectation is that shocks in one country's real estate market would directly spillover to other real estate markets through established channels, including migration and capita movement. Yet, shocks in real estate markets and cross-country spillovers are not always direct. Country-specific real estate market shocks that are not explained by fundamental factors such as migration and capita movement could spill over to other markets, causing price synchronicity (Vansteenkiste and Hiebert, 2011; Liow, 2013; Kim and Park, 2016). Studies on quantifying such spillovers continue to gain traction. More recently, Lee and Lee (2018) and Milunovich (2020) examine co-movements and spillovers among sampled developed and Eurozone real estate markets. Lee and Lee (2018) report that the US and Italy were the largest net transmitters of shocks to international real estate markets during the GFC and the European debt crisis. Milunovich (2020) finds that the US followed by Italy, is the leading net transmitters of real estate market shocks to their international counterparts. While these studies, among others, point to international spillovers, a global perspective remains unexplored.====Various explanations have been offered for real estate market interdependencies and spillovers. Prior studies report factors including economic resemblance (Case et al., 2000), global real interest rates (Ahearne et al., 2005; Otrok and Torrenes, 2005), extravagant price increase expectation (Shiller, 2007), housing supply, and household income (Jacobsen and Naug, 2005), monetary policy (Pomogajko and Voigtländer, 2012) among others. The results have thus so far been mixed. Fan et al. (2019) explain that the mixed results could be attributed to the methods adopted in previous studies. They note the time-domain approaches used in previous studies ignore the frequency horizons of real estate markets. To overcome this problem, we adopt the wavelet methodology, which provides both time and frequency viewpoints.====The aim of the current study is two-fold. First, extend the coverage of previous investigations to provide a global perspective on real estate market connectedness and spillover. We propose that a global examination becomes necessary given the glaring evidence of increasing global real estate portfolio holdings. To that end, we utilize country-specific real estate market returns to quantify spillovers among global real estate markets (Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland, United States, United Kingdom, and South Africa), covering all five continents (Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania). Our empirical approach draws from the spillover index of Diebold and Yılmaz (2014) to measure return spillovers and illustrate the directions of spillovers in a network diagram. Hence, we visualize spillover-transmitting markets and spillover-receiving markets systematically. In this way, our examination also provides an in-depth understanding to investors interested in maintaining international real estate portfolios.====Second and novel to the literature, we explain the extent of spillovers employing standard bilateral features, sentiments, and market conditions applying gravity and wavelet model, respectively. The gravity model is traditionally used to examine bilateral trade flows between trade partners and has increasingly been used to explain spillover transmissions in recent years. In its simplest form, the gravity model measures trade patterns and explains them based on bilateral commonalities. The main components of the model are economic size and geographic proximity. The current study adopts the gravity model in line with recent studies to unveil the role of common bilateral factors in explaining the return spillovers. Importantly, bilateral factors tend to provide a viable information-sharing channel between markets (Balli et al., 2015; Gelos and Sahay, 2001) through which spillovers can occur. Thus, utilizing the gravity model, we are able to study these information-sharing channels and how they influence international real estate spillovers.====We adopt a contemporary wavelet approach that provides both time and frequency perspectives to explain the magnitude of spillovers. The wavelet coherence method measures co-movement of two time series in time-frequency space. A significant advantage is the ability to decompose the time-varying co-movement into various market conditions and investment horizons. Thus, the wavelet coherence approach simplifies traditional associations in terms of both frequency and period to unveil the interdependence associations among international real estate markets. For investors and financial market stakeholders with different investment horizons, the wavelet approach paints a more precise interdependence structure, more so for investors seeking a portfolio of international real estate and other financial instruments. To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first to adopt the wavelet coherence approach in examining how sentiments and shocks in market conditions explain real estate market spillovers.====The results show that the U.K. and the U.S. are the largest transmitters, whereas France, followed by Italy, Finland, and Ireland, are the heaviest recipients of return shocks. The U.K. and the U.S. are the two most significant net transmitters, whereas Ireland and France are the heaviest net recipients of return spillovers. Interestingly, Norway is the only market that nearly neutralizes the return shocks. We also show that both the U.K. and the U.S. are deeply linked with other markets with a similar exchange of return spillovers. We note a sharp spike and upward trend in spillovers after the GFC, accompanied by subsequent heightened uncertainty during the European sovereign debt crisis and recently the prolonged course of Brexit.====From our cross-sectional analysis, we find that bilateral trade linkages have a positive and sizeable impact on the level of pair-wise return spillovers. This finding echoes the significant role of trade relations in explaining cross-market spillovers. Thus, trade relations provide an information-sharing channel between trading partners that augments economic integration and return spillovers. Further, the wavelet coherence analyses suggest that positive economic sentiments mitigate return spillovers among global real estate markets. We also report evidence that bullish periods in other asset classes reduce real estate market return spillovers. The results are heterogeneous over time but remain intuitive and follow the limited studies that postulate co-movements and return spillovers in real estate markets.====The remainder of this study proceeds as follows.

One factor possibly accounting for segregation is the inability of minority households to afford housing in White neighborhoods, where housing units historically have been largely owner-occupied single-family homes. In recent years there has been a dramatic shift in the housing makeup of many of these neighborhoods, with single-family rentals increasing in share. Rentals lower the cost of neighborhood entry. Our results, which suggest that these rentals reduce neighborhood racial segregation for Blacks, support policies that seek to maintain and grow single-family rentals within White neighborhoods.","Neighborhood racial segregation continues to be a major social problem within America's metropolitan areas. Segregation has been linked to a whole host of inequalities, including access to jobs (Weinberg, 2000), schooling and single parenthood (Cutler and Glaeser, 1997), and future earnings (Chetty and Hendren, 2018; Chetty et al., 2014). One possible factor accounting for segregation is that housing in White neighborhoods tends to be relatively expensive, owner-occupied, single-family homes that many minority households, because of their lower incomes, may find unaffordable. Either these households cannot afford the price of these homes, or they are unable to satisfy mortgage underwriting criteria.====Since the Great Recession, many White neighborhoods have changed in a way that has made single-family (SF) housing more affordable within these neighborhoods. Namely, SF ==== units are now a larger share of the total number of SF homes and a larger share of the total number of all housing units. The growth in SF rentals has come from the conversion of SF owner-occupied homes and increasingly from new construction. By allowing minorities to avoid the transaction costs and down payment requirements associated with homeownership, rentals lower the cost of neighborhood entry and increase the affordability of housing. The question we address in this paper is whether the switch in SF housing tenure in favor of rentals has increased racial integration within urban neighborhoods where minorities have historically been underrepresented. The importance of addressing this question is twofold. First, moving forward, SF rentals are expected to remain an important part of the housing inventory and therefore may bring permanent declines in the level of neighborhood segregation. Second, whether more affordable housing of ==== within White neighborhoods will decrease housing segregation is unresolved within the empirical literature, with roughly equal numbers of studies suggesting opposite answers to the question. From a policy perspective, reliable evidence on this issue is therefore imperative, as policymakers seek the best way to better racially integrate America's neighborhoods.====Our analysis is based on a balanced six-year panel of thousands of neighborhoods (census block groups) falling within nine of the ten largest urban counties within the state of Florida. For the years 2008 through 2013, we relate shifts in a neighborhood's housing stock in the current year in favor of SF rentals to changes in the U.S. Census Bureau's estimated average racial composition within the neighborhood measured over the current and future four years. Hence, the estimation allows changes in the neighborhood's share of SF rentals to have a long-run effect on the percentage of the neighborhood's residents who are minorities, where the latter are broken down into non-Hispanic Blacks (henceforth, Blacks) and Hispanics. Because these percentages can rise in response to SF rentals either because of minority entry or non-Hispanic White (henceforth, Whites) exit, we also estimate models that reveal the underlying migratory patterns across racial groups that account for our neighborhood compositional results. Models are also estimated that relate changes in the share of SF rentals to changes in the presence of each racial group by housing tenure (renters versus homeowners) measured as a percentage of the neighborhood's households.====Results obtained from the estimation of our neighborhood compositional models show that within neighborhoods where Blacks have historically been underrepresented, an increase in the share of housing units represented by SF rentals increases the share of the neighborhood's residents who are Black, resulting in greater racial integration. The effect is both highly statistically significant and nontrivial in magnitude. Of particular importance is that the effect can be found regardless of neighborhood income level and whether the dominant racial group within the neighborhood is Whites or Hispanics. The housing tenure models indicate that the increase in Black share comes from renters and not homeowners. Also of considerable importance is that the results from the estimation of our migration models show that the increase in integration is due mostly from Black entry and not the exit of Whites or Hispanics. The results from replicating our analysis for Hispanics as the minority group contrast to the results obtained for Blacks. An increase in the share of SF rentals has varying effects on the share of Hispanic residents across our different neighborhood types, but generally, these effects are either not statistically significant or negative in sign.====In the next section (2), documentation is provided on the increase in SF rentals. Studies that have some relevance to our inquiry are reviewed in Section 3. A conceptual framework underlying our empirical methodology is provided in Section 4. Section 5 describes our panel of Florida neighborhoods. The three sets of models we estimate (racial composition, housing tenure, and migration) are described in Section 6.

We analyze Norwegian census and administrative data using extensive controls for youth, household, housing, mobility, and neighborhood characteristics and employ, as a methodological first in this domain, family fixed effects. We find that, compared to an otherwise-comparable sibling experiencing identical residential contexts, a youth who lived one more year in a home owned by their parent(s) had a 1.4 percentage-point higher probability of completing high school by age 21 and a 1.7 percentage-point higher probability of enrolling in college by age 20. These effects arise from homeownership per se, independent of its relationship with dwelling type, mobility, or neighborhood.","The determinants of children's development of human capital have long been of interest to economists. Underlying much of the existing child development literature is Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems model, which postulates that children's outcomes are influenced by both characteristics of family of origin as well as the characteristics of dwelling units and neighborhoods in which children live and interact (Bronfenbrenner and Morris, 1998). This latter realm of dwelling and neighborhood context brings housing economics to the forefront. To what degree does the childhood housing career – the cumulative exposure to particular dwellings, neighborhoods, mobility patterns and tenures experienced by children – independently affect educational outcomes in early adulthood?====There is a broad consensus based on strong research designs regarding impacts of the first three elements of childhood housing careers. Dwellings that suffer from substandard structural quality (e.g. damp, cold), toxic substances (e.g., lead, mold), and/or overcrowding harm health and cognitive-behavioral development and thereby educational outcomes (Prescott and Vesbo, 1999; Goux and Maurin, 2005; Lien, Wu and Lin, 2008; Newman, 2008; Mohanty and Raut, 2009; Bourassa, Haurin and Hoesli, 2016, Loopoo and London, 2016; Clair, 2018; Cordes, Schwartz, and Stiefel, 2019).==== Neighborhoods manifesting violence, pollution, deviant peers, concentrations of disadvantaged populations and weak schools retard cognitive and educational achievements (Mohanty and Raut, 2009; Galster et al., 2016; Chetty et al., 2016; Galster and Santiago, 2017; Chetty and Hendren, 2018; Chyn, 2018; Laliberté, forthcoming).==== Similar harms arise if children change residences frequently (Aaronson, 2000; Lien, Wu and Lin, 2008; Mohanty and Raut, 2009; Gasper et al., 2009; Chen, 2013; Yun and Evangelou, 2016; Cordes, Schwartz, and Stiefel, 2019), partially as a result of intervening impacts on substance use, social functioning, mental health, and sexual and deviant behaviors (Astone and McLanahan, 1994; Pettit and McLanahan, 2003).====Unfortunately, no such consensus exists in the literature regarding the human capital developmental impacts of the last element of housing careers: rental vs. owner tenure. There are many putative benefits to children living in a home owned by their parents, including superior physical conditions, stability of tenure, skill development and wealth, plus more developmentally supportive role-modeling, behavioral supervision, and self-esteem of parents. Whether these benefits are manifested empirically has been the source of much contention, however. Persuasive statistical evidence has been difficult to obtain due to the challenges of selection, omitted variables, endogeneity, and heterogeneity by income and ethnicity (Newman and Holupka, 2013). Newman and Holupka (2013: 235) summarize the state of knowledge as follows:====In this paper, we aim to contribute to this literature by answering the research question: To what degree does the cumulative childhood experience of living in a dwelling owned by parents affect the probability of completing secondary school and attending a post-secondary (college) institution as a young adult? We use data from Norwegian census and administrative registers that provide extensive controls for family, child, dwelling, residential mobility and neighborhood characteristics. We attempt to surmount the daunting methodological challenge of disentangling the selection effect from the causal effects of homeownership by employing an intra-family analysis, comparing educational outcomes across full siblings who have spent differential amounts of time in owner-occupied housing during their childhood. To our knowledge, this is the first time this family fixed-effect method has been employed in estimating the effect of homeownership on young adult educational outcomes.====The family fixed effects model effectively controls for any time-invariant family background effects that may affect both parents’ tenure choice and children's educational attainment. Siblings who grow up in the same household with the same parents share the same home environment as well as neighborhood and social environment at large. Although parental behavior towards each child may not be exactly the same, the extent to which they value education and emphasize educational attainment as a life goal, is likely to be conveyed to all children in the household. Moreover, parental practices such as reading to their children, attending parent-teacher conferences, helping with homework and, in general, taking an interest in their children's schoolwork, that have all been found to benefit children's educational outcomes, are also likely to benefit all children similarly. However, while the family-fixed effects remove time-invariant unobservable parental characteristics, there may be other time-variant family characteristics at play that still produce a correlation between unobservable characteristics subsumed in the error term and the homeownership variable and therefore bias the coefficient of interest. First, changes in family income may influence both the choice of housing tenure as well as access to enrichment activities that boost children's academic performance. We therefore explicitly control for parental income during childhood. Second, family dissolution will often cause both a drop in income and a move in addition to the emotional turmoil brought on by the event itself, all of which are likely to have a negative impact on children's educational outcomes. We include controls for both moves as well as time not spent with both parents in order to control for this event.====Based on the lack of consensus about the existence and magnitude of homeownership effects on young adult educational outcomes and the fact that we are using an identification strategy new to the field, we prioritize rigor and internal validity over generalizability in our approach. Our sample consists of siblings for whom we have exact information on timing of moves and tenure transitions. For reasons articulated more fully in the data section of the paper, we employ a low-mobility sample where both variation in homeownership exposure and its presumed impact are expected to be lower than in a population-representative sample. Still, we find evidence that cumulative exposure to homeownership raises the probability of completing secondary school and enrolling in college, even after controlling for family characteristics, dwelling type, mobility and neighborhood.",Childhood Housing Tenure and Young Adult Educational Outcomes: Evidence from Sibling Comparisons in Norway,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137721000243,12 May 2021,2021,Research Article,74.0

This paper describes the residential dynamics of persistent neighborhood deprivation over a period of 28 years. We examine small-scale, predefined, physically contiguous neighborhoods with public housing. We utilize unique longitudinal administrative data for the period 1986 to 2013 to follow individuals and their characteristics over time. With our unique data, we are the first to document that deprived neighborhoods function as a transit stage in residents’ housing trajectories. On average, residents’ unemployment rate increases before they enter a deprived neighborhood, and sharply declines two years before they move out. In line with the aforementioned findings, the results suggest that an increase in economic resources is positively associated with leaving a deprived neighborhood compared with non-deprived neighborhoods. Hence, residents’ moving patterns contribute to deprived neighborhoods maintaining their relative position. However, as both the socioeconomic difference between in-movers and out-movers and the turnover rate decline over time, residents’ moving patterns account for a small share of persistent neighborhood deprivation. Thus, with the unique data, we show that deprivation in neighborhoods is mainly attributable to long-term residents who on average do not improve their socio-economic characteristics.","Policy-makers have been paying increasing attention to socioeconomically deprived areas, as such areas are assumed to create externalities, which in turn reinforce the areas’ residential composition (Atkinson and Kintrea, 2001; Christensen, 2013; McCulloch, 2001). Consequently, many Western European countries have launched interventions aimed at individuals, and placed-based interventions in deprived areas, the main objective being to improve residents’ socioeconomic characteristics, as well as to renew the neighborhood (Couch et al., 2011; Lawless, 2011; Lawless et al., 2010; Neumark and Simpson, 2015). However, studies report that the socioeconomic status of such neighborhoods has remained relatively stable over time (Andersson and Bråmå, 2004; Bergström and Van Ham, 2010; Heblich et al., 2016; Musterd, 2005; Tunstall, 2016; Weatherall et al., 2016). There can be many explanations as to why the neighborhoods remain deprived, despite extensive political interventions.====Previous studies explain that persistent neighborhood deprivation is a result of low-income residents being trapped in the neighborhood due to lack of job accessibility (Gobillon and Selod, 2007; Mills and Lubuele, 1997), low quality endogenous neighborhood amenities such as schools (Durlauf, 1996), negative social interaction (Damm and Dustmann, 2014; Galster et al., 2008; Rotger and Galster, 2018), and discrimination on the housing market (Ahmed and Hammarstedt, 2008; Pager and Shepherd, 2008). Other studies suggest that the socioeconomic differences between people moving in and out of a neighborhood represent a key mechanism reinforcing persistent neighborhood deprivation (Andersson, 2013; Andersson and Bråmå, 2004; Bailey and Livingston, 2008; Bergström and Van Ham, 2010; Norman et al., 2005; van Lenthe et al., 2007, Robson et al., 2009,2008). Yet we know surprisingly little about the extent to which persistent neighborhood deprivation is either due to the same individuals who do not change characteristics over time, or due to different individuals with similar characteristics. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to investigate how the residential composition behind persistent neighborhood deprivation evolves over time and what role deprived neighborhoods play in individuals’ housing trajectories.====Using unique individual-level micro data for the entire Danish population between 1986 and 2013, combined with predefined small-scale neighborhoods, we first explore the role deprived neighborhoods play in individuals’ housing trajectories. In particular, we describe individuals’ attachment to the labor market from three years prior to their moving into a deprived neighborhood until they move out. Moreover, we investigate the link between an increase in socioeconomic resources – entering employment – and residential relocation from deprived neighborhoods. Second, we quantify the degree to which residents’ moving patterns account for neighborhood deprivation. We focus on the share of residents without attachment to the labor market or education system (henceforth the unemployed or unemployment rate)====. Hence, we decompose the unemployment rate into the part that is due to movers and the part that is due to stayers for each year between 1987 and 2013.====In the literature on neighborhood deprivation, neither the size of neighborhoods nor the concept of deprivation are uniformly defined (Durlauf, 2004). However, Hardman and Ioannides (2004) and Chetty et al. (2018) stress the importance of small-scale neighborhoods when studying economic residential segregation and non-market social interactions. Consequently, we use predefined neighborhoods in the public housing sector with an average number of approximately 1,100 residents aged 16 to 64. Similar to studies in the US and Canada that apply the official US and Canadian poverty measures (Chetty et al., 2016; Jacob et al., 2013; Kling et al., 2007, and Oreopoulos, 2003), we rely on the official Danish definition of a deprived neighborhood (The Ministry of Urban, Housing and Rural Affairs, 2014). Hence, to be defined as deprived, a neighborhood within the public housing sector must meet at least three parameters of five criteria with regard to the socioeconomic and ethnic composition of the neighborhood. Consequently, as in the studies in the US and Canada, this definition is based on population outcome.====Our results suggest that on average, residents’ unemployment rate increases before they enter a deprived neighborhood and sharply declines two years before they move out. Furthermore, our descriptive empirical evidence shows that employment transition seems to propel residents out of deprived neighborhoods to higher degree than for non-deprived neighborhoods and that newly employed residents in deprived neighborhoods tend to relocate in neighborhoods that are better-off in terms of residential composition.====However, this selective moving pattern contributes only modestly to the permanent high unemployment rate and has declined during the last 28 years. Simultaneously, we observe both a declining socioeconomic difference between in-movers and out-movers as well as a lower turnover rate combined with a high concentration of long-term residents with poor labor market outcomes. Hence, residents’ moving patterns contribute to maintaining the deprived character of the neighborhood by mainly replacing those who improve their labor market outcomes, although persistent deprivation is primarily attributable to long-term residents with poor labor market outcomes.====The paper is structured as follows.

Testing across the price distribution, we explore the cap’s impact on the share of the market experiencing: 1) a price decline; 2) unchanged rents (nominal rigidity); 3) a positive growth rate below the cap; 4) the maximum allowable growth (4%); and 5) growth above the cap. Our identification strategy uses a contiguous border difference-in-difference approach on a novel property-level tenancy panel. We find the overall rent growth rate fell by 1–2 percentage points following the regulations. However, we find different impacts across the distribution: not all high growth rates converged to the cap as the distribution generally shifted to the left and nominal rigidity rose. Furthermore, we find some inflationary pressures on rents that previously were unchanged as landlords priced up to the cap. Heterogeneous effects by company or household landlord are evident.","The economic dynamics of price inflation for rental housing has long been complicated by two aspects of rental markets. The first issue relates to rent control regimes aimed at limiting price rises, boosting tenant affordability and ensuring security of tenure (Lind, 2001, Haffner et al., 2008). The research on the costs and benefits of rent control measures is extensive, with considerable focus on investment and housing quality (Sims, 2007, Arnott and Shevyakhova, 2014), community composition (Sims, 2011), the impact on unemployment duration (Svarer et al., 2005), tenancy length (Munch and Svarer, 2002) and homelessness (Early and Olsen, 1998). Haffner et al. (2008) also explored the degree to which the balance of tenant and landlord rights matter for the efficacy of regulations. Diamond et al. (2019) find that rent controls impact tenant mobility and drive up rents in the long run.====The second issue in housing rental markets is the existence of nominal rigidities where prices are unchanged for the same property from period to period. The impact of price rigidities in housing is critical in terms of the broad debate about price stickiness and the impact of monetary policy changes. In theory, central bank interventions do not have a full pass through into inflation because prices do not respond sufficiently quickly (Kehoe and Midrigan, 2015) or rigidities prevent price changes. Given the high share of the household budget that is allocated to housing,==== the extent of nominal price rigidities in the housing market is a critical aspect in understanding the transmission of monetary policy and the measurement of inflation (Ambrose et al., 2017, Ambrose et al., 2018, Diewert et al., 2009, Dougherty and Van Order, 1982).====Despite the extensive literature, there are few studies which directly quantify either the impact of rent controls on rental price inflation across the price distribution and the degree of nominal rigidity in the housing market. This paper addresses this gap in the literature. In order to do this, we exploit a quasi-natural experimental setting before and after the introduction of rent controls in the Republic of Ireland in 2017. As a result of the regulations, certain local electoral areas (LEAs) in the country were classified as rent control areas with other LEAs remaining unclassified. In the rent control areas, the rate of nominal rent increases were limited to 4 per cent annually. We use regulatory micro-data on tenancy agreements in Ireland at the property-level taken from the supervisory returns collected by the Irish rental regulator, the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB). For the purpose of this study we extract a property-level panel dataset. Our main identification strategy uses a contiguous border design difference-in-difference which limits the control and treatment groups to geographically bordering areas.====Our empirical testing is as follows. First, we directly test the impact of the controls on rental growth to explore whether the regulations slowed price inflation (a non trivial result as even if the controls trimmed the tail of the distribution this does not necessarily mean the overall level might fall). Second, we go further than the existing literature to assess the implications of the regulations on the share of the market experiencing differing growth rates. For example, landlords could opt to set prices: (a) above the 4 per cent maximum; (b) at the cap; (c) lower than the cap but with positive growth; (d) leave rents unchanged (nominally rigid) or (e) reduce rents. Which of these options they choose is likely to depend on their bargaining power in the market, the ability to recoup the cost of tenant turnover, and the desire to protect real returns by maximising rental growth. Our research design to identify these effects uses a multinomial logit difference-in-difference approach which splits the distribution into these five groups. We can then test the relative likelihood of being in each of the groups, as compared to growing above the 4 per cent cap. We also have unique data on the type of investor which allows us consider whether the landlord is a company or household. We can use this to test for heterogeneous effects that may arise from the different constraints these landlords face.====In relation to this contribution, our research is closely linked to a number of studies. Two recent studies use micro data to explore changes in German rent regulations in 2015 (Breidenbach et al., 2019, Mense et al., 2018) with both finding the regulations had a negative impact on rental inflation. Sims (2007) considered the impact of ending rent control in Massachusetts. He found that rent control had reduced prices. More recently, Fitzenberger and Fuchs (2017) looked at the impact of rent regulation on prices in Germany using a quantile regression while Oust (2018) found little affect of the removal of rent control in Oslo on the level of rents. Another notable study is Diamond et al. (2019) which uses a law change in San Francisco to test the impact of regulation on tenant mobility and prices levels. As our focus is on the price growth distribution, we feel our research is complementary to this study. By exploiting the quasi-natural geographic variation of our panel data which is unlikely to be impacted by omitted tenant variables, and exploring the distributional effects in more details, our research builds on these studies.====Indeed, our paper would be closest to Fitzenberger and Fuchs (2017); so it is important to document the innovations in our research. First, we specifically look at the distribution of growth rates above and below the cap of 4 per cent. They do not narrow in on the distribution at the point of the cap. Indeed, they do not show how many tenancies would be explicitly affected by the cap in Germany which we do (above and below 4 per cent). Building on this, testing how the growth rates move differently across the distribution overall, and in particular depending on the type of landlord, is a novel aspect of our paper. This includes our explicit consideration of the issue of nominal rigidity which is an important economic concept in its own right. Thus the distributional assessment we undertake is different to the quantile approach in their paper. The policy guiding their assignment rules depends on the level of rent above and below certain thresholds: it is more difficult to know whether the rules bind in the case of their law change whereas our rent cap applies to all tenancies regardless of the starting rent level.====Second, we exploit a different identification strategy. While Fitzenberger and Fuchs (2017) explore a national law change which impacts different duration tenancies but is common across all geographies, we use geographic variation in assignment of the rent control rules as our identification variation. If there were other aspects of the legal environment that would impact the length of tenancy, but were also correlated with the introduction of the German reform, then this may affect their identification. Finally, the case study of Ireland is useful as it is a market with very limited rental protections which is in contrast to the strongly protected rental market in Germany. Thus our findings should give a different country context and has a distinct contribution.====Another novel aspect of our research is the focus on nominal rigidity. Our third empirical test is to directly consider the impact of rent controls on nominal price rigidity. There are two potential competing hypotheses as to how landlords may react to the regulations. First, nominal rigidity may rise if landlords are not able to recoup the cost of tenant turnover. In this case, the cost of losing a tenant due to large rent increases outweighs the loss in real earnings growth with rises now capped by 4 per cent increases per annum. The second hypothesis suggests that nominal rigidity may fall if landlords increase rents by the allowed regulatory level in order to maximise cash flow from their investment. Disentangling these hypotheses is an empirical question. Three previous papers consider the issue of nominal rigidity in housing rents but none interact this with price controls. Genesove (2003) explored the presence of nominal rigidity in apartment rents in the US over the period 1974–1981, focusing on areas without rent controls in operation. He found a high share of properties displayed nominal rigidities (approximately 30 per cent). Shimizu et al. (2010) considered the stability of the Japanese CPI during the 1990’s credit boom and focused on the degree of nominal price rigidity in housing as an explanatory factor. They found that 90 per cent of rents are unchanged annually and this depends on the level of the rent as compared to the market. Finally, Aysoy et al. (2014) used a national panel of housing units in Turkey to explore the degree of nominal rigidity over the period 2008 to 2011. They found that 31.5 per cent of rents did not change over time and that this was affected by tenant characteristics and search and moving costs.====A number of findings emerge. First, overall rent controls had a deflationary impact on the market with the inflation rate dropping by approximately 1–2 percentage points after the introduction of the regulations. Second, we uncover a considerable fall in the share of rent price increases above the 4 per cent limit consistent with the regulatory framework. These findings indicate that the regulations have been broadly effective in lowering the level of rental inflation in the classified areas. Considering the impact across the price distribution, we find that, relative to previously setting prices above 4 per cent, landlords were most likely to price at the regulatory maximum followed by just below the limit but with above zero growth.====In relation to the impact of rent controls on nominal rigidity, we find that the share of zero growth contracts increased after the introduction of the measures. An increase in no price change contracts may arise due to the risk of tenants leaving after a rent increase and such costs not being recoupable. Furthermore, the findings of the multinomial logit estimates present an interesting picture of the impacts of rent controls across the price distribution. We find that, relative to no change, the likelihood of price increases at, or just below, 4 per cent has increased after the regulations in the treated areas. This may be due to landlords attempting to protect the real value of contracts given their inability to reset rents between tenancies. While the overall effect of the policies has been to dampen rents, they have also caused inflation at other points in the distribution consistent with a protection of real return by landlords (a movement from previous unchanged to positive growth).====We find differences by landlord type with non-professional investors (individual households) more likely to have nominally rigid rents and also less likely to have increases at, or below, the maximum allowable. This may be driven by the fact that such households are unable to absorb tenant turnover costs as easy as professional companies. Overall, we find that, faced with a common, market-wide regulatory maximum, landlords react heterogeneously to set prices at different points across the distribution.====A final test that we include is the extent to which there has been an impact on tenancy turnover. We find that the number of agreements drops by 3 on average in treated areas which is a fall of 6.5 per cent. This may indicate (a) lower mobility as our data cover only new rents or (b) a push factor towards unregulated tenancies.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows.

In this study, using the household panel survey, we examined the relationship between LTC facilities and the migration, particularly moving out, of elderly households from their respective houses and municipalities. The results show that house owners do not typically move out from their housing. Meanwhile, renters tend to stay in municipalities where LTC facilities are accessible. In particular, if the number of beds at LTC facilities per hundred elderly increases by 10 percentage points, the probability of the elderly to move decreases by about 0.35–0.37 percentage points. In municipalities where the new type of elderly facilities was introduced in 2011, owner households headed by people aged 60–65 years and renters headed by aged 60–65 years and 75 years and above reduced their residential mobility.","The rapid progression of aging populations and the weakening of the family's role as the primary caretakers of the elderly are common problems in developed countries. Japan is rapidly becoming one of the most aged countries in the world; its elderly ratio was 27.7% in 2017 (Cabinet Office, 2018). In addition to the high aging ratio, more than half of the households with elderly people consist of a single person or couples without children (Cabinet Office, 2018; Fig. 1-1-8). It may be difficult for members of such households to expect informal care from their family. Therefore, a long-term care (LTC) facility is an option when LTC is required.==== According to a survey of people aged 55 years and above by the Cabinet office, 42.9% of men and 55.1% of women want to move to a location with LTC or medical facilities when they need LTC (Cabinet Office 2007). Therefore, as the number of single elderly households increases, the demand for LTC facilities will increase. However, there is a shortage of LTC facilities in Japan, and across municipalities, many elderly people are awaiting admission.====Since 2011, through mergers, the number of hospitals and clinics has decreased, leading to a more efficient use of medical resources. However, the number of beds at LTC facilities has increased. Therefore, the availability of LTC facilities has become one of the most important factors in defining the attractiveness of a municipality from the perspective of the elderly.====In such a situation, single elderly households may move to municipalities with sufficient LTC facilities when they require LTC. Inter-jurisdictional migration of the elderly has a significant influence on the demographics, fiscal performance, and social security policy of the concerned municipalities, as well as national social security policy. As emphasized by Newbold (2015), migration of the elderly is an important research subject in regional science. However, there is a lack of research on the mobility of elderly households in Japan. Moreover, most previous studies use aggregated data, and only a few studies use micro-level data. Starting from Nakazawa (2007), a series of studies based on Japanese municipal-level aggregated data has examined the relationship between the relocation of elderly households and LTC facilities, finding that the elderly moved to municipalities where LTC facilities were adequate.====These studies use the net number of elderly movers at the municipal level over a 5-year period; they do not include the attributes and characteristics of these movers. By contrast, Kojima (2013) is the only study that uses Japanese household-level datasets. He examined the mobility of elderly households using the 7th National Survey on Migration in 2011. However, the study lacks variables related to economic factors such as household income and assets. In addition, the study does not distinguish housing tenure, and pools owner-occupied and rental housing samples together. Moreover, it ignores LTC facility variables. The parameter estimates derived by omitting important variables and ignoring differences in tenure may not be reliable. Therefore, to the best of our knowledge, there are no studies of elderly migration based on economics using micro-level data in Japan.====However, if we examine previous research based on micro-data from an international perspective, we find an abundance of studies on elderly migration and the determinants of mobility, such as separation from or death of a spouse (Feinstein and McFadden, 1989; Venti and Wise, 1989; Angelini and Laferrere, 2012), retirement (Ermisch and Jenkins, 1999), geographic distribution (Banks et al., 2012), housing price volatility (Banks et al., 2010), property tax levels (Shan, 2010), and distance from children's residence (Painter and Lee, 2009; Lee and Painter, 2014). However, there are no studies that examine the availability of long-term care facilities as determinants of the migration decision of the elderly.====This study analyzes the mobility of elderly households, focusing on them moving out of present housing to understand the important determinants of mobility. It tests the hypothesis that elderly households with low ability of LTC provision within the household, such as those without children, move to municipalities with adequate LTC facilities. Moreover, we test this hypothesis based on the homeownership type (owner-occupied or renter-occupied) to show that the ease of relocation and the possibility of receiving family care affect the incentive to move to an LTC facility.====To test the hypothesis, we estimate models of elderly household mobility using a household panel survey, and data on municipality-level LTC facilities from 2004 to 2018. We conducted the analysis based on a sample grouped by housing tenure due to their differences in mobility rate and economic resources, such as income and assets, especially, housing equity. Our category of households with children does not distinguish between households living with and without children at the time of the survey. Households without children have never had or raised children. We conduct this because housing tenure and having at least one child may be related to the bequest motive and could influence the likelihood of needing LTC when someone becomes frail or disabled.====Moreover, we analyze a causal impact of the new type of elderly facility on residential mobility of the elderly. In November 2011, new type of long-term care facility called ==== was introduced. We consider that this is a natural experiment for households. The staggered difference in differences method (Athey and Imbens, 2018) is a useful statistical approach for investigating the effect of the introduction of the new mode of LTC facility on the mobility of elderly households as the number of such housing increased gradually since the introduction.====We obtain the following results. Owners do not move out from their houses, whereas renters tend to stay in cities where LTC welfare and private nursing homes are accessible. In particular, a 10 percentage point increase in the number of beds of facilities per hundred elderly decreases their probability to move by 0.35–0.37 percentage points. Our baseline models are robust even if we estimate the models using logit models considering the rare case of the elderly's mobility. From the second analysis, in the municipality that introduced elderly housing with life support service, owners, headed by people aged 60–65 years, reduce their probability to move by about 0.01 percentage points. Conversely, renters, headed by people aged 60–65 years and 75 years and above, reduce their residential mobility by about 0.06 and 0.08 percentage points, respectively.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly introduces the LTC system in Japan. Section 3 presents a simple model and Section 4 examines the data used in this study.

Households that purchase a house with an area less than or equal to 90 m,"It is well documented in the literature that it is optimal for individuals to hold at least some stocks in their portfolio (Samuelson, 1969; Merton, 1969, 1971; Andersen and Nielson, 2011). However, Campbell (2006) points out that households often do not follow the predictions of portfolio theory, and many households hold no risky financial assets. Cocco et al. (2005) argue that the welfare loss from nonparticipation in the stock market can be sizable. Insights into the causes of stock market nonparticipation could not only increase efficient financial decision-making but also improve social welfare and personal lifetime income and consumption (Campbell, 2006; Andersen and Nielson, 2011).====For the majority of households in any economy, housing accounts for the dominant share of household assets, and the privatization rate of housing in urban areas is as high as 80%. The purchase of a house is the single most important investment decision that most families will make, as it will affect all of the family's future financial decisions (Kullmann and Siegel, 2003). Thus, the causal effects of housing wealth on household behaviors are of great interest to economists and policymakers (Li et al., 2020).====While many scholars have investigated the determinants of stock market participation (Barberis et al., 2006; Christelis et al., 2009; Grinblatt et al., 2011; Bonaparte and Kumar, 2013; Dimmock et al., 2016; Briggs et al., 2020), whether and how housing wealth affects stock market participation remain unclear, and previous studies have reached mixed conclusions. Housing wealth appreciation may affect stock market participation through three channels. 1) The ==== (Chetty et al., 2017): According to the permanent income hypothesis, an increase in asset price will lead to an increase in household wealth, which in turn increases stock market participation. 2) The ==== (Hurst and Stafford, 2004): Homeowners can borrow more as the collateral value of their home increases, and thus, budget constraints are relaxed. 3) The ==== (Zhong et al., 2020): Increased housing wealth reduces the need for precautionary savings and encourages increased consumption and stock investments. However, housing may also have a negative impact on stock market participation. In particular, the volatility of housing prices and the illiquidity of housing lead to background risk, which may crowd out stock market participation (Palia et al., 2014). In addition, the investment attribute of housing leads to a substitution effect, as it uses funds that could otherwise be used for stock investments (Zou and Deng, 2019). Therefore, given the lack of a clear prediction of the effect of housing prices on stock market participation, the question is essentially an empirical one.====A major challenge to identifying the causal effects of housing prices on stock market participation is that the housing and stock markets may be jointly shaped by economic conditions or unobserved confounding factors. Due to the potential concurrent trends of housing prices and stock market participation caused by unobserved factors, and the self-selection of households that make housing purchases or stock investments, causal identification is extremely challenging. Although previous studies have used the value added of housing, changes in the average price of state housing, housing elasticity, and residential land supply allocation quotas as instruments (Flavin and Yamashita, 2002; Cocco, 2005; Cooper, 2013; Chetty et al., 2017; Zou and Deng, 2019; Briggs et al., 2020), these quasi-experiments do not involve a specific housing wealth effect on household stock market participation.====Fortunately, China provides us with an appropriate setting for studying this issue. In the wake of China's housing reform, the real estate market has experienced an unprecedented boom over the past decade. To cool it down, the Chinese government implemented a series of housing policies in the mid-2000s. The policies, which generated discontinuity in the size of housing units, provide us with a quasi-experiment to explore the real housing wealth effect on stock market participation. In addition, during the real estate market boom, the Chinese stock market experienced a downturn, providing us with further opportunities to examine the determinants of stock market participation.====To establish causality, we rely on changes in Chinese housing policy as an external shock and implement a regression discontinuity (RD) design to evaluate the housing wealth effect. China's State Council, cabinet, and seven ministries issued a document in 2006 that reduced the down payment percentage for housing units with floor areas less than or equal to 90 m==== from 30% to 20%. On November 1, 2008, the central government lowered the property deed tax for purchasing housing units with floor areas less than or equal to 90 m==== from 3% to 1%. Thus, housing just below and above the threshold of 90 m==== may have similar characteristics but different housing price growth rates because of the particular terms given to houses with floor areas less than or equal to 90 m==== (Li et al., 2020).====Our empirical findings can be summarized as follows. First, our baseline estimation verifies that the policy increases the housing wealth of the treated households and thereby promotes their participation in the stock market. The RD estimation shows that over the past decade, the annualized growth rate of prices for housing with a floor area less than or equal to 90 m==== increases 1.92% faster than for housing with a floor area more than 90 m====. Households whose housing has a floor area less than or equal to 90 m==== are more likely to participate in the stock market than their counterparts. The instrumental variable (IV) estimations show that when the annualized growth rate of housing prices increases by 1%, the probability of stock market participation increases by 1.6%. This increase is a nontrivial promotion of stock market participation compared with the average stock market participation of 13%. Second, households with strong liquidity constraints are sensitive to housing wealth appreciation. This finding indicates that housing wealth relaxes households’ liquidity constraints to a certain degree, inducing them to invest in stocks. Lastly, the housing wealth effect is stronger for younger individuals and employees of state-owned enterprises (SOEs).====We contribute to the literature in several ways. First, this study identifies an important determinant of stock market participation (i.e., housing appreciation). Using an unexpected change in China's housing policy as an external shock to identify the real housing wealth effect, we document strong evidence that the housing wealth effect significantly enhances household stock market participation, supplementing previous studies on the determinants of stock market participation. Our analysis has useful implications for understanding the stock market participation puzzle.====Second, we contribute to the literature on the economic consequences of the real estate market at the micro level by evaluating whether and how the increase in household wealth caused by changes in real estate prices affects households’ stock market participation. Although the literature has demonstrated many effects of real estate prices, the effect of housing prices on household stock market participation remains unclear. Obtaining a better understanding of the relationship between the real estate markets and stock markets is valuable given the importance of these two markets. Our paper complements the findings of Li et al., 2020 by providing evidence that housing wealth appreciation has a considerable influence on household stock market investment decisions. Moreover, we conduct cross-sectional tests to understand the potential channels through which housing wealth affects households’ investment decisions. We find that households with strong liquidity constraints are sensitive to the housing wealth effect, indicating that housing wealth can impact individuals’ decisions by alleviating their financial constraints. This assertion also complements the findings of Li et al., 2020.====As this study estimates the causal effect of the real estate market on stock market participation decisions in a typical emerging country, our findings provide clear policy implications to regulators concerned about the joint development of the real estate market and stock market.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains the housing policies, describes the data, and provides our RD estimation framework. Section 3 presents our empirical analyses, including the manipulation tests, baseline estimation, IV estimation, and a series of robustness checks. Section 4 discusses the mechanisms.

We also find that property tax levy limits dampened the fiscal response to the housing bubble and bust. During the housing bubble period, property tax revenues and capital expenditures rose significantly faster in non-levy limit cities than in cities subject to levy limits, but then fell more sharply during the housing bust period. We estimate that the direct effect of the housing bust was responsible for 21% of the decline in the general revenue of large central cities from 2009 to 2011.","The Great Recession was precipitated by a severe housing crisis with housing prices falling by more than 50% in some areas, and with a more than six-fold increase in the number of housing foreclosures between 2004 and 2011. While there already exists a large literature on the price dynamics of the housing market before, during, and after the recession and on the causes of the sharp rise in foreclosures, to date there has been very little research on the impact of the recession and the housing crisis on the ability of local governments to finance the delivery of public services.====In this paper, we focus on the impacts of the housing crisis on the financing of large American central cities. As we will show, the decline in housing prices and the rise in foreclosures led to substantial reductions in both revenues and spending of the nation's largest central cities. The fiscal impacts of the housing crisis were not only severe, but long lasting. Although the Great Recession ended in 2009, in 2016 real per capita expenditures in many central cities were lower than they had been in 2006, the year prior to the recession.====This paper provides the first comprehensive analysis of how the housing crisis impacted the revenues of a nationwide sample of large central cities. As we will describe in more detail below, the focus of most of the existing literature has been exclusively on the relationship between changing housing prices and property tax revenues.==== In this paper, we provide an in depth analysis of the property tax channel and also explore the direct effect of the housing market on the general revenues (from all sources) of cities. Nearly all the existing research used data on housing prices and property tax revenues for periods that ended prior to or during the Great Recession. Because changes in property tax revenue tend to lag changes in housing prices by several years, these studies were too early to directly observe the full fiscal impact of the housing crisis. Furthermore, most of the existing literature relies on national data, data at the state or metropolitan area level, or focuses on local governments in a single state. Providing a better understanding of how changes in the housing market affects local government finances is important for the smooth functioning of cities. Public services such as education, public safety, sanitation, and infrastructure investment are essential not only for the well-being of city residents, but also play a crucial role in supporting housing values.====Any effort to analyze the impacts of the housing crisis on the financing of U.S. cities faces the problem that the governmental structure and organization of cities varies substantially across the country. Direct comparisons across municipal governments are often highly misleading because public services provided to central city residents and businesses often come from a variety of different governments. In a few cities, the municipal government finances and provides nearly all local government public services, while in many other cities, the responsibilities for financing and providing services is divided between the municipal government and several overlying independent governments, such as counties, school districts, and various kinds of special districts.====To deal with these variations in governmental structure, we have constructed a unique central city database called ====, or FiSCs. The creation of FiSCs, which we describe in more detail later in the paper, involves accounting for all revenue and spending of a central city municipal government and those portions of revenue and spending by independent school districts, county governments, and special districts that are collected from or flow to central city residents and businesses.====To explore the linkages between changes in the housing market and the fiscal condition of central cities, we construct an empirical model of the relationship between several measures of housing market performance and the property tax revenue and the total general revenues of FiSCs. Our analysis utilizes 2000 through 2014 housing market and fiscal data for 90 FiSCs representing most of the nation's largest central cities. We pursue an estimation strategy that employs city and year fixed effects plus multi-year lags between housing market characteristics and local government revenues. The lag structure is consistent with the administrative procedures used to implement the property tax. These steps eliminate or reduce any possible endogeneity that may exist between contemporaneous characteristics of the housing market and local government fiscal behavior. In Section 6, we include a detailed explanation for the plausible exogeneity of the major explanatory variables used in our analysis.====The most important channel through which the housing market impacts local government finance is through the property tax. We find both statistically and economically significant effects of housing price changes and foreclosure rate changes on property tax revenues, with the housing price effect about two times as great as the foreclosure effect. The elasticity of the property tax with respect to the housing price index centers on 0.20. Property tax revenues responded similarly to both housing price increases and decreases. Sharp housing price declines were strongly correlated with subsequent increases in foreclosures rates. The net effect is that housing price declines, and the associated foreclosures that followed, can explain more than ¾ of the decline in property tax revenues from 2009 to 2014. These declines were reinforced by declining income in most of the sample cities. We estimate that the decline in median income from 2009 to 2013 was associated with an additional decline of almost three percentage points in property tax revenues.====The severity of the housing crisis was also linked to the broader local and even state economies, with greater housing market stress associated with significant declines in total city revenues. We estimate that the direct effect of the decline in the housing market was responsible for about 21% of the decline in general revenues. Given the correlation between income changes and housing market stress, this estimate is likely to understate the full effect of the housing market on the decline in the general revenue of FiSCs.====Section 2 provides a brief review of the small literature on the fiscal impacts of the Great Recession and the boom and bust housing market cycle on the financing of local governments. In Sections 3 and 4, we describe the methodology used to construct our fiscally standardized cities dataset and then present data on the changes in the various sources of revenue of central cities (represented by our 90 FiSCs) for the period starting in 2007, the year the Great Recession began, through 2015. In Section 5, we discuss changes in the housing market in the 90 central cities in our sample. We trace the pattern of the CoreLogic housing price index and of foreclosure rates before, during, and after the Great Recession.====To help ascertain the impact of changes in the housing market on the financing of central cities, we estimate several models using data from 2000 through 2014. Section 6 describes our modeling strategy, followed in Sections 7 and 8 by brief discussions of the data and estimation issues. In Section 9, we present the results of our empirical analysis by first focusing on the impacts of changes of housing prices on property tax revenue and general revenues. We then address the independent effects of changes in the foreclosure rates in Section 10. In Section 11, we investigate the extent to which the housing price and foreclosure results are influenced by the existence of property tax levy limits. Finally, in Section 12, we summarize the results and discuss some of the policy implications.",The effect of the housing crisis on the finances of central cities,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105113772100019X,2 April 2021,2021,Research Article,79.0

However, under the conditions of market mixture, the correspondence can be multi-valued and the existence of a single function is an illusion. The market segmentation approach decomposes a complex correspondence into simple functions. In this paper, we propose an automatic segmentation method that satisfies the submarket’s equilibrium and substitutability conditions. Our empirical results show that our method provides a reasonable segmentation.","The hedonic approach is now widely used in housing market analysis. Its theoretical background is shown in Rosen (1974),==== and an analysis based on the regression is simple and useful. However, we need to ask: is there no difficulty in its application on the real housing market?====Under the ideal situation in which all of the variables that affect prices are collected and the data are collected from the single housing market, the price function can be estimated with regular statistical methods. However, real empirical research is far from this ideal situation.====This gap is particularly severe in housing markets. For instance, because housing locations never move, they are tied to the local markets. Therefore, extremely distant housing cannot belong to a single market. Additionally, some of the variables that affect the market, such as income, are almost always unobservable because they are private information.====In these real research conditions, the price functions are multivalued. In other words, due to market differences and unobserved variables, even if the observed characteristics of the housing are the same, the corresponding housing prices can be different. This happens because the correspondence between price and observed characteristics can be multivalued if some of the characteristics (including the submarket in which each housing unit belongs) are unobserved. In this case, housing that looks the same can have different prices.==== This multi-modality of the conditional distribution of the housing price makes it difficult to estimate the price function.====When a simple function cannot explain the correspondence between price and observed characteristics adequately, flexible nonlinear functions are sometimes applied to estimate the price function. However, it simply produces a strong illusion that a single complex housing price function is observed. In other words, flexible nonlinear functions make us believe that one (observed) bundle of housing characteristics corresponds to a single price.====Therefore, we need a novel estimation method for the price function that works even if the illusion exists. To achieve this, we ask if this illusory single complex hedonic function can be approximated with a combination of (simpler) hedonic functions.   Consequently,  the price====function should be segmented into submarkets in which the marginal utilities are almost the same, instead of employing nonlinear models.====In this paper, we employ the market segmentation approach (Goodman and Thibodeau, 1998) to clarify this illusion and capture the complex market structures. When the market in which housing belongs is unobserved, the slopes of price function possibly shift depending on the market. This shifting slope makes the estimation of price function difficult. In Appendix A, we discuss how we are unable to capture the market structures, even if we simply apply the nonlinear models for hedonic analysis. In Appendix B, we show that a non-parametric method also has the same problem. Meanwhile, the market segmentation approach has the potential to overcome this problem.====In spite of this potential, the market segmentation approach is not free from difficulties. The most difficult point when the market segmentation approach is applied for market analysis is that it is not obvious how to segment the market. Another problem is how many submarkets we should segment the market into. Although various automatic market segmentation methods have been proposed in the literature (Islam and Asami, 2009), there is no agreement on which method is the best.====In the present paper, a novel automatic market segmentation method is proposed. This method fulfills the econometric criteria for market segmentation, and it not only resolves the problems of previous methods but it also automatically determines the number of submarkets.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The previous research is reviewed in Section 2. In Section 3, we revisit Rosen (1974)’s model and we also introduce the theoretical motivation for the proposed method. We arrange existing estimation methods with the general representation for the market segmentation in Section 4. In Section 5 we propose a novel method to overcome the problem mentioned in Section 4. Section 6 shows applications for rental housing markets in the Tokyo area, and finally we conclude in Section 7.

This in turn increases the chances of making an ill-informed housing purchase decision, thus reducing the likelihood of such a purchase. Using data from the Survey of English Housing from 1993 to 2008, we document that, consistent with our prior, households moving over long distances – defined as 50 miles or more – have, on average, a 5.5 percentage point lower probability of owning their next home compared to shorter-distance movers. We also provide evidence consistent with the views that long-distance movers (i) are aware that they possess less and/or lower quality information and (ii) are more likely, especially if they are renters, to move again quickly after presumably having accrued better information on the property and local area.","The decisions ‘whether to own or rent a home’, ‘where to buy’, and ‘what property to buy’ are all risky. In this paper, we hypothesize that as households move farther away from their original residence, search in the destination housing market becomes more difficult and more costly.==== This difficulty of search largely arises from the heterogeneity of housing and neighborhood in terms of their characteristics and their location. As moving distance increases, the amount and quality of information collected on the destination housing market and individual housing units decrease, and, therefore, purchase decisions become riskier.====A prospective buyer of a property arguably faces risks in multiple dimensions. Risks can be property or neighborhood specific. They can also be idiosyncratic (leading to mismatch) or general/systemic. And there are interactions in these dimensions. For example, some risks are idiosyncratic in nature and related to the property (i.e., I hate the house that I just bought), idiosyncratic and neighborhood specific (i.e., I can't get to my work place as easily as anticipated), systemic and property specific (i.e., a leaking roof) or general and neighborhood specific (i.e., crime is higher than expected or rising after moving in).====Owner-occupiers are more exposed to these risks than renters because ill-informed purchases cannot be easily reversed. Renters may also choose the ‘wrong’ neighborhood in remote destination markets, but this has less grave consequences as, in contrast to owner-occupiers, renters do not have to bear the capital loss associated with the sale of a home plus they face much lower housing transaction costs and can therefore move more easily.==== Moreover, if say a neighborhood turns bad, this should, at least in the longer-run, also be reflected in lower subsequent rents or smaller rent increases, compensating the renter for the bad event occurring. This line of reasoning is supported by Simonsohn and Loewenstein (2006) who find that renters move repeatedly to adjust their housing expenditure.====A reasonable strategy for a mover to a ==== would therefore seem to be to rent a property first and delay a home purchase until more (reliable) knowledge can be accumulated about the new neighborhood and property stock. As a consequence, we would expect that, all else held constant, households that move farther away from their original residence are less likely to own their next property than households that move nearby. This is the main hypothesis that we put to the data.====Our empirical analysis employs data from the Survey of English Housing (SEH). The SEH is a rich dataset that provides essential information such as the housing tenure status of households (the dependent variable), the distance moved (used to compute our key explanatory variable) and various demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of households and household heads (the control variables). Controlling for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of mover households helps mitigate concerns of spurious correlation and omitted-variable bias. A crucial additional advantage of the SEH is that it provides information on the pre-move conditions of households. In particular, the tenure status at the previous accommodation helps control for unobservable preferences and the ability to own of households.====Our empirical analysis reveals three novel insights. Firstly, we provide evidence in favor of our main hypothesis that the probability to own is adversely affected by a lower quantity and quality of information as proxied by the long-distance move dummy variable, all else equal. Our analysis reveals that the negative effect is not only highly significant in a statistical sense but also reasonably meaningful in an economic sense. Based on our most rigorous specification, the average marginal effect of a long-distance move (longer than 50 miles) as opposed to a shorter-distance one is to decrease the probability for a household to own their next home by 5.5 percentage points.====Secondly, we demonstrate that long-distance movers have less negative subjective assessments of specific problems – crime, vandalism, litter and graffiti in the neighborhood – than short-distance movers, conditional on the objective neighborhood quality and the resulting equilibrium house prices. We verify by contradiction that this is consistent with the view that long-distance movers are aware of the fact that they possess less reliable information on the destination housing market.====Thirdly, we test the hypothesis that the adverse effect of a lower quantity and quality of information, as proxied by the long-distance move indicator, on the probability to own is of a temporary rather than permanent nature. We find that the length of stay at the destination market is adversely affected by long-distance moves and this negative effect is stronger for private renters, consistent with the view that the optimal strategy for longer distance movers is to rent first and accumulate information on the destination housing market prior to making a momentous investment decision.====Our paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we discuss the findings of previous related studies, clarify the contribution of our paper to the literature and derive empirically testable hypotheses.

The country experienced an explosive, 11-fold increase in real housing prices in urban areas between 2000 and 2007, followed by a sharp decline and stabilization. This paper traces the movements across different regions, types of housing, unit size categories, and neighborhood types. We find that prices moved together closely, implying a linked, if not unified housing market, along with ==== effects that were felt broadly throughout the urban economy.","Changing property values matter in emerging markets as well as developed economies, as housing constitutes a large share of household wealth and budgets in both settings. Expected house price appreciation is critical to decisions involving purchases and housing finance. Government policies both affect and are affected by housing affordability and wealth distribution, and these in turn are influenced by real estate values. Finally, real estate price movements affect mortgage lenders’ willingness to extend loans. While obvious for developed countries, housing wealth is of central importance in a wide range of emerging markets as well.====Macro questions arise as to whether and how rapidly economic growth and short-run shocks are transmitted across regions and social classes. These are particularly important in mineral-rich and other rapidly growing middle-income countries, where growing prosperity often appears to benefit only a fortunate few. While wage and income distribution data are important for answering these questions, they do not reflect wealth accumulation: indeed, rising wages may have only modest welfare effects if housing costs and other income-elastic assets rise rapidly. Consequently, understanding wealth distribution patterns is also important and, in transition economies, household wealth is overwhelmingly concentrated in owner-occupied housing that was distributed with the collapse of socialism.====In this paper we examine house price appreciation rates in the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan. After achieving independence and undertaking market reforms, Kazakhstan experienced a spectacular rise in real GDP and housing wealth, followed by an arresting period of stagnation and real estate price decline during the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and thereafter. In addition to its remarkable economic cycles, Kazakhstan has exceptional housing sales and value data, thereby allowing us to gain insight into the nature of real estate markets in upper-middle income, volatile economies.====We are particularly interested in distinguishing national and local components of Kazakhstan's housing price appreciation rate to determine the nature of locales that experienced particularly fast or slow house price changes. We follow Gyourko and Voith (1992), who perform a similar analysis for 56 metro areas in the United States between 1971 and 1989. They find a common national component in real appreciation during that time period: even though prices differed vastly across locations, real appreciation rates did not.====Evidence from Kazakhstan shows comparable findings. We use a panel data set covering bi-annual prices of existing houses/apartments for 16 regions between 2003 and 2013. Our data set, although limited to grouped (aggregate) data at the region/date/housing characteristic level, is quite detailed with respect to housing characteristics, allowing us to investigate patterns with a precision rare outside of fully-developed economies.====We begin by examining housing price data differentiated by type of construction materials (brick versus lower quality “panel” housing), quality of housing design (ordinary versus improved design versus “elite” housing), and by the quality of the location areas (upscale neighborhoods versus regular ones). We find a significant national component in real appreciation rates common to all regions in each of the above-mentioned categories. Moreover, there is little regional discrepancy in appreciation rates. Only the resource-rich, low population density region of Atyrau consistently exhibits lower housing appreciation for brick units in upscale areas and elite apartments. Other regions have similar rates of housing appreciation in a majority of cases, suggesting that markets are competitive over the medium run and that Kazakhstan's price movements tend to equilibrate over a 10-year horizon.====We then employ a more detailed data set for brick houses, disaggregated further by the number of rooms in a unit (one/two/ three/four or more rooms); i.e., differentiated by housing unit size.==== The focus on a specific type of construction is important because the grouped data do not adjust for compositional changes. The overall conclusions turn out to be similar to those found using the first data set. As we explain below, the homogeneity of Kazakhstani housing within a limited number of types also means that this disaggregation of grouped data weakly approximates conventional hedonic estimations.====We also perform the analysis for pre- and post-2007 crisis. It appears that there is more regional differentiation in appreciation rates in the short run as opposed to the medium run, and during the boom (pre-crisis) period rather than slow growth (post-crisis) period.====The paper also tests for serial correlation in appreciation rates. Positive serial correlation would suggest persistence in appreciation (or depreciation) and the opportunity to earn abnormal returns. Negative serial correlation implies mean reversion and an absence of bubbles. (Gyourko and Voith, 1992) find significant serial correlation in several US metropolitan areas, six of which exhibited persistence in appreciation rates. In our case, joint tests confirm existence of serial correlation for some housing categories. However, only one region – South Kazakhstan– consistently exhibited persistence in appreciation rates, while the rest of the regions either showed mean reversion or had positive coefficients in only one category of housing.====Finally, the paper tests for similarities in time trends across different categories of housing at the national level. Elite housing exhibits slower appreciation than typical and improved-design housing, which appreciate at similar rates. There also are differences in appreciation between comparable units in upscale versus regular areas. Rates of price growth for brick and panel housing differ for typical and improved design apartments in upscale areas – although, we acknowledge, these patterns could reflect differential quality improvements. Additionally, comparable units of different sizes appreciate at similar rates except for elite housing in upscale areas. In short, housing prices surged throughout urban Kazakhstan for much of the period under study. To the extent that patterns differ by type, housing prices for less elite units and in less prestigious urban neighborhoods tended to grow more rapidly, implying modest convergence. However, the main bottom line is that LOOHP (the “law of one hedonic price”) is largely consistent with the observed data: price levels vary, but there is little evidence to suggest that spatial arbitrage opportunities or differential utility driven by variation in housing cost appreciation are important in Kazakhstan, which seems to be a mature, integrated economy.",Housing price appreciation and economic integration in a transition economy: Evidence from Kazakhstan,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137721000176,24 February 2021,2021,Research Article,82.0

Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and a locational choice model, we find that the likelihood of a non-boomerang location being chosen by a young adult increases with local wages, while wages have a much smaller effect on selecting the boomerang option. In addition, the likelihood that a boomerang location is selected actually ==== with the location's unemployment rate. The lower sensitivity of boomerang moves to positive labor market features is substantive in magnitude. We document two distinct ways in which boomerang moves dampen labor market adjustments. Among young adults living in the same labor market as their parent, simulated negative labor market shocks in the form of increases in unemployment accompanied by decreases in wages result in a greater increase in boomeranging than leaving the labor market, hence a residential rather than labor market adjustment. Among young adults living in a different labor market than their parent, boomerang moves are more likely to result in worse destination labor markets than are non-boomerang moves, though a large share of both types of moves are to weaker labor markets.","Geographic mobility is a crucial mechanism for labor market adjustment and hence national economic growth – people tend to move from depressed or low demand labor markets towards areas with greater opportunity where their labor is more productive. Historically, the ability of the U.S. workforce to respond to local labor market conditions through migration has been seen as a key competitive advantage. For individuals, migration can buffer regional shocks and provide opportunities for economic advancement. But recent research documents low and falling responsiveness to local negative labor demand shocks (Notowidigdo, 2020; Yagan, 2019; Bartik, 2018; Dao et al., 2017). Potential contributors to the low responsiveness include offsetting declines in housing costs in areas with negative employment shocks and potentially low gains for movers who come from adversely-shocked places.====At the same time, there is a widely acknowledged increasing trend in the share of young adults co-residing with parents (e.g. Parker, 2012). The literature suggests several explanations for increasing parental coresidence: higher housing costs, worse labor markets, higher college tuition costs, more student debt, and increased social acceptance for coresidence (Newman et al., 2018; Paciorek, 2016; Bleemer et al., 2017; Dettling and Hsu, 2018; Matsudaira, 2016). The delay of young adults forming their own households, and the increase in adult children returning to live with their parents (so-called ‘boomeranging’) have both contributed to this trend (Cooper and Luengo-Prado, 2018).====While both literatures have framed migration or coresidence as a buffer against labor market risk, there is little research that directly pulls these two strands together and explicitly considers the implication of boomerang moves for labor market adjustment through migration. The vast literature on migration as a buffer against labor market risk typically ignores the parental coresidence option. On the other hand, the limited research on boomerang moves does not consider the labor market conditions of the young adult's origin relative to the parental location among those who boomerang, and it does not consider the many other possible destinations to move to, other than the parent's location. In this paper, we model the location and migration choices of young adults who are living independently from their parents, explicitly incorporating the option to remain in their current home, the option to move within or across labor markets (without returning to their parents’ home), and the option to boomerang back to their parents.====Importantly, we differentiate between independent young adults who live in the same metropolitan area (metro) as their parent and those who do not, as the mechanisms driving their location choices are distinct. Young adults who live near their parents could adjust to a weak local labor market along the residential margin rather than the labor market margin by making a boomerang move. These young adults therefore do not leave their weak labor market. In contrast, for young adults who live in another metro, the parental coresidence option may be attractive regardless of the parents’ local labor market conditions since it comes with low-cost housing, and so they could adjust to their locally weak labor market by boomeranging to their parents’ metro. As a consequence, these young adults may appear unresponsive to the destination's labor market conditions when moving across labor markets. Each of these channels leads to lower labor market sensitivity via boomeranging, but only the latter involves moving across labor markets.====We use the geocoded Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), focusing on individuals aged 18–35 years at any point between 1997 and 2017. Because of the PSID family linkages, we can identify where each young adult's parents live, which allows us to include the parental coresidence option regardless of whether it is selected, and to capture whether the young adult is living in the same metro as a parent. Among young adults in our sample for whom we observe a complete history between the ages of 19 and 29, nearly a quarter make at least one boomerang move.====In the body of the paper, we first document increasing boomerang rates among young adults, particularly those who were living in their parents’ metro prior to boomeranging. We then estimate a location choice model that explicitly incorporates both migration and parental coresidence, taking the parent's specific location as exogenous.====We find that after controlling for housing costs, higher wages increase the likelihood of choosing a non-boomerang location more than they do for a boomerang location, implying weaker sensitivity to labor market conditions for boomerang moves. In addition, while a non-boomerang location's unemployment rate generally has no significant effect on the likelihood of that location being selected, the unemployment rate in a boomerang location is significant and positively associated with it being chosen. These patterns hold for young adults who are living in the same labor market as their parent at the start of the time period, as well as those living in different labor markets from their parents.====Model simulations of negative local labor market shocks that simultaneously increase local unemployment and reduce local average wages provide additional evidence. Among young adults living in the same metro as their parent, we find relatively large increases in boomerang moves, that is, they adjust on the residential margin rather than leave the (now weak) labor market. Specifically, a one standard deviation increase in unemployment combined with a one standard deviation decrease in wages, results in a 3.0 percentage point increase in the probability of the young adult leaving the metro compared to a 3.6 percentage point increase in the likelihood of boomeranging within the metro. Further investigation of cross-labor market moves among young adults living in a different metro than their parent shows that boomerang moves are more likely to result in a destination with higher unemployment and lower wages relative to the original labor market, than are non-boomerang moves.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows.

The identification comes from the regional variation in the large influx of Syrian refugees to Jordan in the wake of the Syrian conflict which started in 2011. Combining detailed household-level surveys with information on where Syrian refugees are concentrated, we employ a difference-in-difference approach and show that the influx had negative impacts on housing quality and increased the rents paid by local households. Residential mobility also increased in response to the flow of refugees, and this could have acted as a channel through which housing quality decreased and may have attenuated the impact on rents. The effects are more pronounced among poorer and less-educated households, those who are arguably in competition with refugees for housing.","The eruption of the Syrian conflict in 2011 has caused a massive regional displacement of Syrian refugees. Most of those who left the country sought shelter in neighboring countries like Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. With the assistance of the international community, these countries have expended a significant amount of resources to meet the social service needs of incoming refugees. Jordan, for instance, hosts around 660,000 registered Syrian refugees, 80 percent of whom live outside official refugee camps (UNHCR 2019).==== These refugees mostly flowed to communities close to the official refugee camps and those close to the Syrian border, which have longstanding ties to Syria, where they constituted a substantial increment to the population. They also flowed to the Amman metropolitan area, the center of gravity of the Jordanian economy.====Using geographical variation in the exposure to refugees, this paper aims to estimate the causal impact of the influx of Syrian refugees on housing outcomes in Jordan. We combine data on the share of Syrian refugees across different localities (and districts) from the 2004 and 2015 population censuses with panel data on several housing outcomes from the 2010 and 2016 waves of the Jordan Labor Market Panel Survey (JLMPS), as well as repeated cross-section data from the 2006 and 2013 rounds of the Jordan Household Expenditure and Income Survey (HEIS).==== Like most of the studies in this literature, we employ a difference in difference approach to evaluate the change in housing conditions and rental prices in areas with relatively higher flows of Syrian refugees compared to areas with relatively lower flows of Syrian refugees.====The main identifying assumption in such empirical analysis is that high-refugee and low-refugee localities (districts) would have witnessed similar housing trends in the absence of the influx of refugees. To account for the possibility of differential time trends across broader regions of the country, we include governorate (province) level time trends, which would enable us to capture any potential variations between high- and low-refugee localities/districts within the same governorate. We also leverage earlier waves of HEIS to show suggestive evidence that there are no significant differences in the time trends of housing outcomes across high- and low-influx governorates prior to the influx.====We show that the refugee influx had negative impacts on housing quality, and positive impacts on rental prices. The impact is robust to the inclusion of governorate-specific time-trends as well as to accounting for the possible endogeneity of the refugees’ location decisions using instrumental variable methods. The impacts are more pronounced among poorer and lower-educated households, i.e., groups who are arguably in competition with refugees for housing. We further show that exposure to the refugee influx also increases the probability of residential mobility of locals across localities, but from very low initial levels.====While the vast majority of studies examine the labor market consequences of refugee shocks, a few papers focus on the effects on housing markets in host communities (e.g., Alix-Garcia et al., 2012; Balkan et al., 2018; Depetris-Chauvin and Santos, 2018; Kürschner and Kvasnicka, 2018). While most of these papers find positive effects on housing prices and rents, those that examine local level as opposed to regional level effects often find negative effects due to the mobility response of natives. Existing studies also differ in terms of whether they examine short- vs long-run effects of migration and refugee shocks.====We contribute to this literature in a number of ways. First, this is the first paper that looks at the case of Jordan, where the size of the influx is much larger relative to the native population compared to countries covered by existing studies. Second, existing studies have differed in their conclusions on the effect of migration shocks on housing outcomes depending on the geographical scale they have examined. At least for some of the outcomes, we are able to examine effects at two geographic levels: the locality level, which approximates local and neighborhood-level effects, and the district level, which approximates metropolitan and regional level effects.==== Unlike other studies, we do not find differences in the sign of the effects at these two levels, which we attribute to the limited mobility response of natives. Because Syrians and Jordanians share the same culture and language, and often the same tribal and family roots, it was easier for Syrians to integrate in Jordanian communities leading to an attenuated mobility response of natives from neighborhoods where the refugees settled. Third, the paper is not limited to analyzing the effect of migration shocks on rental prices, but also examines effects on housing quality, and type of tenancy. Finally, we provide direct evidence on the impact of the migration shock on the residential mobility of natives.====Because our data is from one to four years following the major influx of Syrians into Jordan, we are, by necessity, estimating the relatively short-term impact of the migration shock. Our analysis of effects on rental values is very short-run since it involves data from the year in which the bulk of refugees arrived (2013), but our analysis of effects on other outcomes such as housing quality, quantity, and type of tenancy is more medium-term since it is using data from 2016/17.====The paper adds to a series of studies examining the effects of the Syrian refugees on different outcomes in Jordan including employment and wages of Jordanians (Fallah et al., 2019), employment outcomes for migrants (Malaeb and Wahba, 2018), internal mobility of Jordanians (El-Mallakh and Wahba 2018), and education outcomes (Assaad et al., 2018).====The rest of the paper is structured as follows.

The consistent overall rent rigidity exists because of the small extensive margin (limited adjustment opportunity) and small intensive margin (rare adjustment in the contract renewal stage). We observe rent rigidity leading to a “tenure surcharge,” that is, sitting tenants pay higher rents than the market rent level because the alternative—high moving costs for tenants—is less attractive. The downward rent rigidity obviously cannot rationalize the conventional explanation of upward rent rigidity in an inflationary context, such as depreciation and/or tenure discount. We show, however, that landlords care about retaining good long-term tenants by offering a small discount during the tenancy, along with a small degree of time/state-dependent adjustments.","Housing rent rigidity has been observed in an environment where the nominal market rent has been rising over time (Aysoy et al., 2014; Genesove, 2003; Hoffmann and Kurz-Kim, 2006; Gallin and Verbrugge, 2019). On the contrary, this paper documents “downward rent rigidity,” which means a long-term renter suffers from paying a rent that is far above the market rent level. The landlord “offers” a ==== (not a tenure discount) that is typically only reduced but not eliminated upon contract renegotiation. The long-staying tenants bear higher rental costs than the short-term tenants, if we ignore the moving costs for tenants.====This poses a challenge to conventional theories developed to explain upward rent rigidity. First, the rent rigidity found here is inconsistent with claims that it is due to physical or economic depreciation, which means the tenant pays a lower real rent for the lower flow of services. Second, we see a big rent decrease after a vacancy, so the “unobserved renovation” (to explain a big rent increase after a vacancy) does not apply. Third, we see rent rigidity leading to a tenure surcharge, and we obviously cannot rationalize this as a way to keep a good tenant, even though Japanese landlords presumably care about retaining good tenants.====This paper documents housing rent rigidity under downward pressure, using a monthly household/room-level movement of housing rents through tenancies and vacancies in Tokyo during the period 2000Q1–2017Q2. We provide evidence that rents have strong rigidity over time, owing to both extensive and intensive rigidity. Because contracts lock in a rent, there is a chance for rent adjustment only at contract renewal or tenant turnover times. However, even at the contract renewal stage, only a small proportion of units change their rents. Thus, rents systematically depart from “marginal” rents (and increasingly over time, as a unit experiences contract renewals), that is, the purely market-determined rents that are set after vacancies. Thus, we typically see a large (downward) rent adjustment when a unit experiences a vacancy.====We observe rent rigidity leading to a “tenure surcharge,” that is, sitting tenants pay higher rent than the market rent level because the alternative—high moving costs for tenants—is less attractive. The downward rent rigidity obviously cannot rationalize the conventional explanation for upward rent rigidity in an inflationary context, such as depreciation (or unobserved renovation) and/or tenure discount.

If you are a homeowner, you are not only fulfilling the American dream but also enjoying an ongoing boost in wealth from home price appreciation. However, the homeownership rate has been dropping since 2004 when it reached the peak of 69.2%. It is now just 63.5% at the level of the mid-1960s. In other words, home prices keep rising and hitting new records, but fewer homeowners benefit.====The question of what determines home ownership has been extensively researched in the literature. The determinants of home ownership include: demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of households (Eilbott and Binkowski, 1985, Gyourko and Linneman, 1996), race of the households (Kain and Quigley, 1972, Yinger, 1995, Munnell et al., 1996), household income and wealth (Gyourko et al., 1999, Charles and Hurst, 2002, Hilber and Liu, 2008), intergenerational transfers (Guiso and Jappelli, 2002), downpayment (Kiyotaki et al., 2011), tax-shelter effect (Ebrill and Possen, 1982, Charles and Hurst, 2002), and immigration factor (Coulson, 1999).====We add to this line of research by studying the real effect of banking deregulations on home ownership at the household level. Most states in the U.S. removed restrictions on intra-state branching and inter-state banking during 1980s–1990s. Banking deregulations intensified bank competition, which likely affected economic performance. Strahan (2003) presents empirical evidence that banking deregulations led to substantial and beneficial real effects on the economy. Many other studies examine how the banking deregulations affect corporate innovation (e.g. Amore et al., 2013), personal bankruptcy (e.g. Dick and Lehnert, 2010), market structure of non-financial sectors (e.g. Cetorelli and Strahan, 2006), and entrepreneurship (e.g. Black and Strahan, 2002).====In this paper, we study the impact of banking deregulations on the likelihood of households becoming homeowners. In particular, we follow a sample of renters in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) data in 1984 and 1989, and separate them into two groups: one group of renters experienced banking deregulations in the next 5 years, while the other group did not. We then analyze the difference in the likelihood of becoming homeowners in the next 5 years between these two groups.==== We find that after controlling for observables, including====household demographic and socio-economic characteristics, state and year fixed effects, and time-varying state-level variables, the effects of banking deregulation measured by both intra-state and inter-state banking deregulations are economically important and statistically significant. In particular, renters who experienced both inter-state and intra-state banking deregulations are 8.7 percentage points more likely to become homeowners than other renters, all else being equal. Given that the unconditional probability of renters becoming homeowners is 26.3 percent, the 8.7 percentage-point increase in the probability is economically important. In other words, banking deregulations, by removing the barriers to branching within state and to out-of-state bank entry, can explain as high as a 33% increase in the likelihood of households becoming homeowners.==== Our results are robust to potential sample-selection bias and functional misspecifications.====There are several possible explanations on how banking deregulations affect the transition of renters to homeowners. We first look at a possible explanation related to income; banking deregulations may boost household income, especially those in the lower part of the income distribution, making home ownership more affordable for these households. Indeed, we find such evidence that banking deregulations have a positive impact on household income, and the impact is larger for households in the lower part of income distribution.====The second possible explanation is related to technology. Dick and Lehnert (2010) suggest that banking deregulations improve financial technology innovation, which further improves lenders’ ability to more accurately price for credit risk and therefore offer credit to higher-risk households. If this is the case, the impact of bank deregulation should be larger for higher-risk renters. We indeed find such evidence.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In the next section, we describe the nature of the banking deregulations in the United States since 1970s. In Section 3, we describe our data and present some summary statistics. In Section 4, we present our main empirical results of the effect of banking deregulations on the likelihood of renters becoming homeowners. Our findings are robust to potential sample selection bias and functional misspecifications. In Section 5, we study the possible explanations of the effect.

Our repeat sales model, which mitigates endogeneity and unobserved heterogeneity, provides robust estimates of negotiated price premiums (discounts) of sellers with expected losses (expected gains). Our model bridges from individual to aggregate price responses, and it supports new stylized facts about housing market cycles. Results suggest that anchoring was associated with reductions in observed changes in ","The growing literature relevant to micro foundations of housing market cycles has developed a significant body of theory and empirical results. Several studies have documented stylized facts for the house price cycle: 1) too much volatility in prices relative to changes in fundamental value (i.e., house values based on income, employment, financing and construction costs); 2) short term positive serial correlation; 3) longer term mean reversion; 4) positive correlation between house prices and the volume of transactions. Structural models explaining housing market cycles have been designed to fit these facts.====A substantial literature shows that the price paid to purchase a house influences the asking price set by sellers at the end of their holding periods, and that this influences negotiated sales prices (Stein, 1995; Yavas and Yang, 1995; Genesove and Mayer, 2001; Einiö et al., 2008; Han and Strange, 2016; Andersen et al., 2020). Anchoring to the asset purchase does not have to reflect psychological loss aversion or irrational behavior.==== It might be due to financial or tax frictions or limited ability to obtain and process information, as suggested by Stein (1995), Barberis and Xiong (2009), Ben-David, and Hirshleifer (2012), Anenberg (2016) and Andersen et al. (2020). When sellers anchor their decisions to the prices paid for their assets, they consider the expected gain or loss over their holding period when deciding whether to sell and at what reservation price. Evidence from the directed search model (Han and Strange, 2016) shows that sellers’ asking prices influence prices paid by buyers.====In this paper, we establish new stylized facts relating anchoring behavior – i.e., positive hedonic coefficients (premiums) on a loss variable, negative coefficients (discounts) for gains – to aggregate house price movements. We find that anchoring to the price paid to purchase a house is associated with substantial reductions in the observed change in house prices during the boom as sellers with gains dominate with their price discounts and with substantially reduced price declines during the bust when the price premiums negotiated by those with losses become important. This dampening of the cycle points to the need to revise models providing explanations of too much volatility (e.g., Novy-Marx, 2009; Glaeser and Nathanson, 2015; Caplin and Leahy, 2011) so that they can explain turning points.==== Our stylized facts are consistent with endogenous shifts in loss/gain quantities that accumulate over a boom (bust), leading to cyclical turning points.====We estimate our models using over 540,000 housing transactions and over 90,000 repeat sales pairs in Connecticut. We evaluate a full cycle in house prices from 2000 through 2017 when a repeat sales index increased by more than 40% (ending in 2006), then declined to a level that was 10% lower than 2002, followed by a mild recovery: see Fig. 1. In our model, the premiums and discounts associated with expected losses and gains are multiplied by the magnitudes of those quantities and by the proportion of sales with expected losses and gains. This produces reduced-form house price indices adjusted for observed anchoring behavior: we refer to these as “contrast relative indices.”==== Contrast-relative estimates are variables that we construct under assumptions eliminating loss and gain behavior.====Using the contrast-relative estimates from our multiplicative model, we examine the association between anchoring behavior and each phase of an important cycle in house prices, 2000–2017. We show the mix of sellers with expected gain/loss, a mix that changes dramatically over the house price cycle, together with the response of sellers to gains and losses suggests new stylized facts: i.e., the behavior of these sellers is relevant at the macro level. This contrasts with previous literature on anchoring, which has shown substantial effects at the individual transaction level but has not shown an association between this behavior and the aggregate level of house prices.==== If we had found little or no reduced-form association, then there would be no reason to add anchoring to the stylized facts listed above.====We address two potential threats to our empirical analysis. First, the anchoring effect may not be identified separately from omitted variables such as time on the market (TOM). For example, in a booming market, sellers may plausibly expect high opportunity cost of waiting to move to another house. If so, they will set relatively low asking prices to lower TOM.==== To mitigate this concern, we assert the testable assumption that all sellers are responding simultaneously to any time-dependent variables such as demand shocks or changes in financial constraints when they set TOM or make listing or withdrawal decisions, whereas each seller has her own anchor which influences selling decisions.==== To test this hypothesis, we include town-year fixed effects. Towns in Connecticut are small municipalities that govern local public schools, other services, and property taxes, providing unusually well-designed controls. Town-year interacted fixed effects capture many sources of time-varying unobserved town-level heterogeneity. The resulting estimates, and experiments with a range of county and year fixed effects, support our hypothesis.====The second threat we examine is that sellers, and buyers who inspect the property, observe characteristics not known to the econometrician.==== We provide evidence that these omitted quality characteristics bias the losses and gains estimated by the conventional hedonic model to be larger on average than true losses and gains, causing loss and gain parameters to be biased upward in absolute value. To mitigate this concern, we follow and extend Zhou et al. (2020) and use property tax assessed values at the time of sale to control the effects of unobserved quality on sales prices expected by sellers and on their expected loss or gain, and we find extensive evidence that the assessor substantially reduces unobserved heterogeneity.==== If unobserved quality can be controlled, then coefficients on loss and gain explanatory variables based on assessed values will be reduced, and that is what we find. Due to the large differences between the estimated results following previous literature and quality-adjusted results using assessed value, we rely on the latter to draw our conclusions.====Despite the reduced coefficients on loss and gain explanatory variables (i.e., premiums on expected losses and discounts on gains are both smaller in absolute value) based on assessed values, we still find that these coefficients are statistically significant. This is because, even with small loss and gain coefficients, the imbalance of the proportion between loss and gain lead to a large impact on aggregate changes in transaction prices. As long as the magnitudes and proportions are large, we do not need a large coefficient to get big effects on the cycle.====Prior to the crisis when 95% of sales have quality-adjusted expected gains, contrast relative changes in house prices were between 8% and 24% higher than those observed, suggesting that loss/gain behavior dampened price increases. During the bust, when about 48% of sales experienced expected losses, contrast relative price changes are over 30% lower than observed. Loss behavior dominated during the mild recovery when it was associated with increases in the observed price change.====Results using asking price supports an influential role for seller behavior. Han and Strange (2016), Carrillo (2013), and others argue that asking price conveys an important signal to the market. Information in the market (e.g., inquiries by potential buyers) is strongly influenced by asking price (Carrillo, 2013). Our results based on sales prices are robust to substituting for them with asking prices.====We report reduced form patterns with limited implications for causation. Premiums and discounts associated with anchoring, magnitudes, and the number of transactions with expected gains and losses are determined simultaneously with house prices. Causal relationships require structural models; our point is that these models need to be consistent with the new stylized facts documented here, whereas this would not be necessary if we had found no association. I.e., in a world without loss and gain behavior, we should observe little effect from our contrast relative associations.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section summarizes our bias-correction addition to the literature on loss/gain behavior. Section 3 develops our contrast-relative analysis.

This structural relationship is important to consider when studying housing prices panels. First, we implement first-generation tests (tests which assume cross-section independence) and find no evidence for stationarity or cointegration. However, we find strong evidence for stationarity and cointegration when we employ second-generation tests (tests which assume cross-section dependence). The spurious results of the former tests may lead researchers on housing prices dynamics to inaccurate conclusions with the potential to ill-inform policy-makers.","Changes in the housing market can have a significant impact on the economy. Brocker and Hanes (2014) support this assertion with two important findings. They find that the burst of a housing bubble has more impact on the subsequent recovery of an economy than a stock market crash. They also find that balance sheets in the banking industry are more exposed to the housing market than they are to the equity and derivative markets. The importance of the housing market for the health of the economy as well as fluctuations in housing prices across the globe over the past decades and their resulting impact on various economies worldwide have increased the interest of researchers on the subject. The most notable price swings in the international housing market in the last few decades were in the 1970s and 1980s as house prices significantly rose and fell (see E.J. Levin and Wright (1997); McCord et al. (2011)). In the 1990s, real house prices doubled in the United Kingdom and a similar increase was also seen in Spain. In USA, the real estate market experienced gains in the 1980s followed by a fall in prices in the first half of the 1990s, which reversed the gains by more than half. Many experts believe that this fall in prices was the consequence of houses being over-valued in the 1980s (i.e. a bubble). Real prices started rising again over the following decade even outpacing the gains in the 1980s. This raised the concern that the housing market was over-valued once again (see Gallin (2006)). In the same vein the most recent crisis, the 2008 global financial crisis, is widely considered to have been caused by the burst of a bubble in the housing market (see Duca et al. (2010); Baker (2008); Demyanyk and Van Hemert (2011)).====The established importance of the housing market in driving economic cycles and its relatively high volatility make it essential to study its dynamic relationship with the economy. Cointegration analysis is useful for this purpose as it can identify the co-movements between housing prices and other economic indicators. One of the main benefits of confirming the existence of a cointegrating relationship is the ability to identify the growth of a bubble. For instance, if it has been empirically established that housing prices have a positive cointegrating relationship with a given indicator, then a prolonged period of increase in housing prices with a simultaneous decrease in the indicator is a strong signal of a housing bubble growing.==== ==== Therefore, adequate policies could be implemented in order to “let the air out of the bubble” before it bursts. Moreover, the estimation of impulse-response functions can provide more insight into how a shock in one economic variable will impact housing prices, which can guide the policy-maker in the implementation of corrective policies. However, the choice of the appropriate model for the estimation of impulse-response functions depends on whether the variables in the model are cointegrated. When no evidence for cointegration is found, a vector autoregressive (VAR) model is used; a vector error-correction model (VECM) is used otherwise.====The main contribution of this paper is to point out a major pitfall in studying the dynamic relationship between housing prices and the economy, which is ====. This pitfall may have befallen many researchers who find no evidence in their panel cointegration tests. As a matter of fact, Gallin (2006), Mikhed and Zemčí (2009a) and Mikhed and Zemčí (2009b) found no panel evidence for cointegration as a rebuttal to the univariate cointegration literature in which evidence for a long-run relationship was found. Other researchers show that the lack of panel cointegration evidence may be due to the use of a linear framework. Their results show that the long-run dynamics of housing prices with the economy may, in fact, be nonlinear (Kim and Bhattacharya, 2009, Tsai et al., 2012, Zhou, 2010). In this paper, we revisit the linear panel cointegration framework and find evidence for cointegration by using state-of-the-art techniques, which are robust to cross-section dependence. Traditional econometric tests (also called ==== tests) assume cross-section independence. Under this assumption, first-generation tests do not perform well when cross-section dependence does exist; they become prone to a type II error. ==== tests have been developed to address this issue as they account for the serially correlated structure of the panel.====The other novelty of the paper is the use of consistent monitoring of the cointegration relationship with a test developed by Wagner and Wied (2017). The housing market crash of the late 2000s occurred over a decade ago, therefore, any research on the housing market using data predating the crash must ensure that this structural break does not invalidate their results. Many researchers have historically split their data around known structural breaks and run their analysis on the sub-samples of the data. In the case of the housing market crash; however, the post-crash data may currently not be long enough if the data is of low frequency as is usually the case for macroeconomic data. In this paper, we formally test whether our cointegration results are distorted by the Great Recession and we find no evidence.====Fig. 1 is a decision tree which shows the appropriate “modeling paths” based on whether there is evidence for cross-section dependence or not. The leaf nodes (i.e. VAR and VECM) are the robust modeling techniques, which the researcher should use to estimate impulse-response functions. Each non-leaf node in the tree represents an econometric test. The left arrows on each node point to the researcher’s next step if the test results provide no evidence for what is tested and the right arrows, therefore, point to what the researcher should do next if the test finds evidence. The root node, for instance, shows that if the cross-section dependence test does not show evidence for serial correlation in the panel, then a first-generation panel unit root test should be used. On the other hand, if there is evidence for cross-section dependence, then a second-generation panel unit root test should be employed instead. This means that if cross-section dependence is not accounted for, test results will not be robust. Moreover, the fact that first-generation tests are prone to a type II error==== ==== in the presence of cross-section dependence means that researchers on international housing prices are more likely to use a VAR model to estimate impulse-response functions as is seen in the literature (see Section 2).====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature on housing prices and their relationship with the economy. The data we use in the empirical framework is described in Section 3. Section 4 provides details on the issue of cross-section dependence and also shows the evidence we found for its existence in our panels. In Section 5, we employ univariate tests as well as first and second-generation panel tests to test for the presence of unit root and cointegration in our panels. The cointegrating vectors and the impulse-response functions are estimated in Section 6. Section 7 discusses the policy implications of the paper’s findings.

What is the impact of house price increases on the supply of housing? How much are house price changes due to land price changes, and what is the contribution of construction prices? How long do house price fluctuations last? When addressing these questions, the interaction between the price and supply of housing in response to shocks needs to be taken into account, as a housing boom or bust can be reflected in price changes, or a supply reaction, or a combination of both. This interaction channel may influence the direction, size and time profile of the price and supply responses to shocks, with a supply reaction potentially mitigating or exacerbating the price response. Macroeconomic models of the housing market featuring a feedback between prices and quantities exist for many advanced or emerging economies using different classes of models, such as traditional macroeconomic models (e.g. Antipa and Lecat, 2010; Grimes and Aitken, 2010; Nobili and Zollino, 2017; Steiner, 2010), DSGE models (e.g. Aspach-Bracons and Rabanal, 2010; Iacoviello and Neri, 2010) or structural vector autoregressions (e.g. Bian and Gete, 2015; Fry et al., 2010; Jarocinski and Smets, 2008; Lastrapes, 2002; Musso et al., 2011).====The concept of land leverage (Bostic, Longhofer and Redfearn, 2007; Bourassa et al., 2011) provides further insights on the response of house prices to shocks.

It builds on the idea that overall house price growth can be regarded as the weighted sum of construction and land price growth, with the weights referring to one minus the land share and the land share in housing value (Davis and Heathcote, 2007; Davis and Palumbo; 2008). To the extent that the construction and land price components react differently to shocks, overall house price growth reflects a combination of the responses of both price components to macroeconomic changes. The relevance of the land leverage hypothesis for the transmission of macroeconomic shocks to overall house prices was, e.g., shown by Davis and Heathcote (2007), who estimate price equations separately for house, construction and land prices, and by Bourassa et al. (2011), who estimate the determinants of the land share next to those of overall house prices.====Looking at macroeconomic models of the housing market from the perspective of the land leverage hypothesis it is striking that its implications for the shock transmission to housing supply have not been explored further. In Bian and Gete (2015) and Iacoviello and Neri (2010) land supply is viewed as a limiting factor in housing production. However, the land price plays no essential role for residential investment. Aitken and Grimes (2010) estimate a supply schedule for new housing construction as a function of factors including land prices, but consider the price of land merely as a cost factor and neglect the contribution of the land price to overall housing value.==== This is in line with the classical Tobin's q view on investment (Tobin, 1969; Tobin and Brainard, 1968), but differs from the land leverage approach. While the Tobin's q perspective on the price of land, which is a non-reproducible asset, fits the view of individual housing investors who must acquire land to build, it is questionable whether it is relevant at the macroeconomic level when it comes to land prices. Within the paradigm of the representative agent, ownership of residential land should not matter, as it is a distributional issue and land sales per se are not associated with value-added.==== Gyourko and Saiz (2004), and Glaeser and Gyourko (2005) showed that the value-to-construction cost ratio, which is also a function of overall house prices and, in line with the land leverage hypothesis, of land prices, is a positive factor for reinvestment in the housing stock.==== All else equal, rising land prices increase the asset value relative to construction costs making residential investment more attractive, whereas rising construction costs dampen the incentives for investment.==== Therefore, changes in residential investment depend on the relative magnitude of the response of construction and land prices to shocks.====With this in mind, this paper modifies a conventional empirical macroeconomic model of the housing market, following DiPasquale and Wheaton (1994) and McCarthy and Peach (2004), to accommodate the insights from the land leverage hypothesis on macroeconomic shock transmission to both house prices and housing supply. To this end, the empirical model features a supply response to house prices, which is allowed to vary depending whether the macroeconomic impacts are transmitted via construction or land prices. To investigate the relevance of the land leverage hypothesis, the impacts of macroeconomic changes are estimated separately for construction and land prices, in addition to overall house prices. We show that the responses of residential investment to construction and land price increases fit the prediction of the asset value-to-construction cost considerations. Residential investment declines in response to construction price increases, while it rises after land price gains that increase the asset value. Thus, the response of residential investment to house price changes depends on the relative contributions of construction and land prices to overall house prices. The positive effects on residential investment from income gains or interest rate declines both work via their positive effects on land prices. In contrast, construction price rises in an improving macroeconomic environment tend to dampen residential investment, while they add upward pressure to overall house prices.====Through the lens of the model, we provide a quantification of typical dynamics on the German housing market. Between 2010 and 2019 owner-occupied residential property prices in Germany rose by around 50%, both for apartments and single-family houses. In the period from 2003 to 2010, house prices rose by around 7.5% cumulatively, without a pronounced fall during the crisis in 2008/2009.==== Also in the phase prior to that and back to the early 1990s, house prices in Germany barely rose as we also show in the paper. In real terms, house prices did not exhibit any pronounced boom-bust episodes until around the year 2012, after which they started to increase strongly (Fig. 1). Since then, real house prices increased by around 30%. Thus, the recent house price boom in Germany up to 2019 appears extraordinary for the German housing market. Conversely, the housing investment ratio (real residential investment relative to the real value of the housing stock) exhibits a pronounced decline after the mid-1990s. This reflects the downward adjustment of the construction sector after the construction boom that was induced by re-unification. However, since then the housing investment ratio barely increased amid strong house price gains.==== Subdued residential investment against the background of strong house price gains might appear puzzling if one takes house price increases as signaling profit opportunities. However, we show in the paper that accounting for the development of construction and land prices in response to the macroeconomic environment helps to shed light on the mechanisms behind the behavior of house prices and residential investment.====The paper also contributes results for Germany to the literature on the macroeconomics of the housing market. In a structural model of aggregate household consumption in Germany, Geiger et al. (2016), and Nocera and Roma (2017) investigate the interdependencies of economic activity, the mortgage market and house prices in Germany. The response of housing supply is not explicitly incorporated such that the joint behavior of prices and supply of housing is not worked out. Lerbs (2014) estimates a single-equation panel model of building permits as a measure of housing supply change, without modeling potential feedback via house prices. The same applies to Gattini and Ganoulis (2012), who provide time-series panel estimates and single-equation regression results for the housing investment effect of house price changes. The feedback mechanism from housing investment to house prices is not estimated. Furthermore, a number of contributions seek to identify and quantify the degree of overvaluation by estimating a fundamental house price (Hertrich, 2019; Igan and Loungani, 2012; Kajuth et al., 2016; Kholodilin and Ulbricht, 2015; Koetter and Poghosyan, 2010), or by deploying time-series methods (Chen and Funke, 2013; Kholodilin et al., 2014). Their focus is more or less exclusively on the long-run determinants of German house prices without analysing the cyclical frequency.====In the remainder of the paper, section 2 introduces the main elements of the stock-flow model into which the regression setup is molded. Section 3 presents the construction of mutually consistent time series for aggregate house, construction and land prices, which are necessary because according to the land leverage hypothesis construction and land prices aggregate to overall house prices. Section 4 discusses the estimation results for aggregate house prices and residential investment. Section 5 presents the key impulse responses of overall house prices and residential, which serve as the starting point for Section 6, in which the transmission channels of macroeconomic shocks to house prices and residential investment via construction and land prices are analysed.

Based on Dutch administrative data, we find that renters and homeowners were less likely to climb the housing ladder during the Great Recession than before and that these upward movement rates recovered to pre-recession levels afterwards. The negative recession effect was driven by a decreased probability of moving to privately owned housing. The decrease in the probability of house buying may be explained by low consumer confidence, housing price uncertainty and a limited supply of housing due to loss aversion.","Households in many Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, including the United States, were strongly affected by the Great Recession through various channels. The average nominal house price in countries in the OECD dropped by approximately 6 percent between 2007 and 2011, and unemployment peaked at 8.5 percent in the first quarter of 2010 (OECD, 2019). In the Netherlands, the average nominal house price dropped by approximately 16 percent between 2008 and 2013. Unemployment rose from 3.7 percent in 2008 to a peak of 7.4 percent in 2014 (Statistics Netherlands, 2020a).====Housing careers may have been affected by the Great Recession as well. The literature has typically focused on the residential mobility of homeowners, emphasizing that movement rates of homeowners decreased. The housing careers of renters are likely to have been affected differently by the Great Recession than those of homeowners, however. This may be primarily explained by differences in the nature of renting versus owning homes. Differences in credit constraints and other characteristic differences between renters and homeowners may be a source of differences in effects as well.==== The effect of the negative house price shock on residential mobility is an example of a channel that may have resulted in differences in effects between renters and homeowners. Negative house price shocks affect the housing careers of homeowners through factors such as the combination of negative equity and loss aversion (Henley, 1998; Genesove and Mayer, 2001; Ferreira et al., 2010; Bricker and Bucks, 2016; Steegmans and Hassink, 2018). Such factors are not relevant for renters.====This paper provides a descriptive study on housing careers in the Netherlands before, during and after the Great Recession, with a focus on the housing careers of renters. We aim to improve the understanding of how housing markets function and how the housing careers of renters and homeowners were affected by the Great Recession. Whereas other studies have focused on residential mobility, we investigate movements up or down the housing ladder as part of housing careers. A slowdown in housing careers may have negatively affected life-course events—like starting families and moving to larger family homes—as well as labor-market careers—like starting new jobs in areas with more jobs.====We conduct our empirical analysis using administrative micro-panel data provided by Statistics Netherlands for the 2007–2017 period. These data cover the entire Dutch population. The Netherlands is a relevant country to study because, like many other OECD countries, it was significantly impacted by the economic recession, and it simultaneously experienced both a severe decline in housing prices and an increase in unemployment in this period.====We estimate a multinomial logit model on movements along the housing ladder. Our evidence shows a strong decrease in movement rates up the housing ladder during the Great Recession for young renters and homeowners. Movement rates up the housing ladder recovered after the Great Recession. The recovery of movement rates, in general, is not in line with evidence from the United States, where movement rates have fallen steadily during the past three decades and have continued to decline since after the Great Recession (Koşar ====, 2019).====Our results suggest that the residential mobility of renters was unaffected as long as renters preferred to stay in the rental segment. Young renters and homeowners who wanted to climb the housing ladder by buying a house were less likely to do this during the Great Recession than before. Low consumer confidence and uncertainty regarding housing prices may have induced young individuals to postpone or cancel their plans to buy houses. This is consistent with evidence provided by Dieleman and Everaers (1994). High asking prices due to negative equity and loss aversion on the part of sellers may have additionally prevented young renters and homeowners from buying and selling houses.====This paper contributes to three strands of literature. First, we study the housing careers of homeowners and renters. The effects of housing price drops on residential mobility has typically been studied for homeowners only (Henley, 1998; Ferreira et al., 2010; Bricker and Bucks, 2016; Steegmans and Hassink, 2018). The Great Recession may have affected residential mobility differently for renters than for homeowners, however.====Second, we use administrative data on house values and various demographic as well as socioeconomic characteristics to study residential mobility. The house value—the so-called WOZ value—is acquired for tax collection purposes, and it is based on the transaction prices of recently traded nearby houses with similar characteristics. The house value is available for all privately owned and rental houses on a yearly basis. House value data allow us to compare the positions of homeowners and renters on the housing ladder. This is vital for the set-up of our study. We apply house values in 2017 to all years to ensure that our comparison is not distorted by house price variation across time. Earlier papers on housing careers during economic crises (Dieleman and Everaers, 1994; Ho and Wong, 2009; Stoll, 2013) have relied on survey data excluding such information on rental house values.====Third, we use the concept of the housing ladder to study residential mobility before, during and after the Great Recession. The concept is intuitive and can be readily linked to demographic and labor-market developments, explaining how life-course events affect housing careers. The concept of the housing ladder has been previously applied in studies mainly focused on homeowners, such as those of Morrow-Jones and Wenning (2005), Ortalo-Magne and Rady (2006), Ho and Wong (2009), Bajari ==== (2013), and Banks ==== (2016). We consider housing consumption over the life-cycle as housing careers to ensure that changes in housing consumption were transitions along the housing ladder. Climbing the housing ladder may imply a move to larger houses or houses with a higher value. Life-course events that trigger changes in housing consumption include cohabitation, divorce, the birth of children and retirement.====The set-up of this paper is as follows. Section 2 discusses the theory behind the concept of the housing ladder. Section 3 describes the relevant Dutch institutional framework. Section 4 discusses the data. Section 5 explains the methodology, and Section 6 presents the estimates. In Section 7, we discuss correlations among various relevant macro indicators.

However, no studies have tested in rural markets, even though anti-LGBT attitudes may be more prevalent there due to conservative social norms and less frequent contact with LGBT people. I study whether the rate of discrimination against same-sex couples differs between rural and urban rental housing markets. I use a matched correspondence test design, sending email inquiries about the availability of rental homes to 445 landlords in 28 markets posing as either a same-sex or opposite-sex couple. Results compare rates of positive response between these groups, suggesting that landlords do not respond at substantially different rates to inquiries from same-sex or opposite-sex couples in rural or urban markets, nor do response rates differ between states with anti-discrimination ordinances and those without.","Though attitudes toward lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights in the United States have shifted radically toward increased acceptance over the past 30 years, LGBT Americans continue to struggle for equal treatment under the law (Fetner, 2016; Rosenfeld, 2017). While the recent Supreme Court decision in ==== banning anti-LGBT employment discrimination may provide a legal basis for a future ban, there remain at present no federal laws prohibiting housing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Unlike other protected classes like race, gender, or disability status, landlords are still free to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation in many states by refusing to sell or rent properties or offering unequal terms to LGBT people, or even advertising that they will not rent to sexual minorities. Twenty-two states and the District of Columbia, as well as some local governments, have passed their own laws prohibiting sexual orientation-based housing discrimination, but LGBT Americans in the rest of the country may find themselves without legal recourse if they are refused housing due to their sexuality. Given enduring anti-LGBT attitudes and the lack of legal prohibitions on discriminatory behavior, it is thus perhaps not surprising that several recent correspondence studies have produced evidence of rental housing discrimination against same-sex couples across U.S. metropolitan areas (Friedman et al., 2013; Levy et al., 2017; Schwegman, 2019). These tests have found that same-sex couples are between 2 and 6 percent less likely to receive responses to inquiries about housing availability. Schwegman (2019) finds this to be true even in markets with anti-discrimination legislation. When inquiries are answered, same-sex male couples are told about fewer available units than heterosexual couples (one fewer unit for every four tests) and quoted annual prices $272 higher (Levy et al., 2017).====While these studies have advanced our knowledge of the extent of discrimination against same-sex couples on the American rental market, they share a common shortcoming: they conduct their tests primarily in urban areas, where attitudes tend to be more liberal, support for LGBT rights is more common, and stricter protections are often in place (Parker et al., 2018; Wald et al., 1996). There is limited empirical evidence of housing discrimination against same-sex couples in rural communities, but Swanket al. (2013) report survey findings that lesbians, gays, and bisexuals living in small towns report higher levels of housing discrimination than peers living in urban areas. If this is true, existing studies may be significantly underestimating the extent of anti-LGBT housing discrimination, especially for the estimated 2.9–3.8 million LGBT Americans living in rural areas (Movement Advancement Project, 2019).====In this study, I assess whether rates of rental housing discrimination against same-sex couples differ between urban and rural areas in the United States through the use of a matched correspondence test design. In doing so, I extend the existing literature on housing discrimination against same-sex couples by widening its geographic scope, providing information about the extent of discrimination in nonmetropolitan areas, where nearly 1 in 5 Americans live. This study is one of the first worldwide, and to my knowledge the first in the U.S., to use a correspondence test design to examine housing discrimination in rural areas. I contribute to the wider correspondence test literature by offering a methodology that addresses the specific challenges of conducting this kind of test outside of a major metropolitan area. In addition, I provide current information about the prevalence of housing discrimination, following other research showing an increase in overall anti-LGBT discrimination since the 2016 U.S. presidential election (GLAAD, 2018; Gonzalez et al., 2018). Here, I begin with a review of previous studies of housing discrimination against LGBT individuals and differences between rural and urban attitudes toward sexual minorities. Then, I discuss my research design and methodological considerations. Finally, I provide results and conclude with a discussion of the limitations of this work and avenues for future research. These results may help to inform future policymaking by suggesting an appropriate geographic level to enact anti-discrimination legislation, and helping organizations target resources to LGBT individuals in communities most affected by housing discrimination.",Homophobia and the home search: Rental market discrimination against same-sex couples in rural and urban housing markets,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137720300802,19 December 2020,2020,Research Article,91.0

This study provides an analysis of the spatial distributions of job accessibility, housing rents, and poverty in a large African city. In Nairobi, Kenya, workers and jobs are not well connected: On average, residents can access fewer than 10 percent of existing jobs by foot within an hour. Even using a minibus, they can reach only about a quarter of jobs. This study further demonstrates that poorer households and residents living in informal settlements are even more limited. Living closer to job opportunities is costly in Nairobi. Not only are housing quality and living conditions frequently better in such areas, but the high value placed on job accessibility also makes these areas more expensive. This severely affects the residential location choices of low-income households.","Job accessibility is a key determinant of not only the productivity of labor forces in cities but also their welfare and poverty. While the concept and measurement of accessibility are not straightforward (see Duranton and Guerra 2016), job accessibility is commonly referred to as the number or share of existing job opportunities a city resident can reach within a given amount of time. At the level of an urban area, a low level of job accessibility for city residents can inhibit the productivity gains from agglomeration economies by constraining a better match between jobs and job seekers (Combes and Gobillon 2015; Duranton and Puga 2004). More importantly, limited job accessibility may disproportionally affect the economic performance of disadvantaged workers. In many African cities, numerous people lack affordable and reliable transport and just walk to work (Lall et al., 2017).==== Low-income households that live farther away from clusters of jobs face higher commuting and job search costs. As the spatial mismatch hypothesis posits (see a review by Gobillon and Selod 2014), low levels of job accessibility could make them even poorer by limiting their employment outcomes.====However, which city residents face limited access to job opportunities depends on a variety of factors, such as the shape of the city, the clustering patterns of employment, the function of housing markets, and transport networks. For example, low-income households may live in inner-city informal settlements by prioritizing their proximity to job opportunities over more desirable living conditions, thus incurring environmental and health risks due to overcrowding and inadequate access to basic services. Living near clusters of jobs may be particularly important for the urban poor, who often engage in multiple temporary and casual jobs. However, the long-term influence of unfavorable living conditions on their well-being is a concern. Thus, it is imperative to empirically assess who suffers from limited job accessibility and whether choosing to live in informal settlements offers better job accessibility to low-income populations in exchange for poor living conditions. In a worse case, informal settlements provide neither good access to jobs nor a healthy environment, instead creating poverty traps (Marx et al., 2013; Turok and Borel-Saladin 2018).====Unfortunately, empirical evidence on how job accessibility and poverty are linked in African cities is scarce. Such an analysis requires data on (a) the spatial distribution of jobs, (b) transport networks, and (c) housing rents and household consumption. Spatial distribution of jobs is hard to obtain for African cities, given the prevalence of informal jobs. Information about minibus networks, a common transport mode in many African cities, is even more difficult to obtain. Although housing rents and household consumption are usually available in Living Standards Measurement Survey (LSMS)-type household surveys, they are rarely representative of both informal and formal residential areas. By addressing all these data challenges, this paper examines the link between job accessibility and urban poverty in an African city by assessing the spatial distributions of job accessibility, housing rents, and poverty.====Our approach is threefold. First, we assessed the overall level of job accessibility for a city. Our study focuses on Nairobi, Kenya. A relatively monocentric city (Antos et al., 2016; Henderson et al., 2016), Nairobi accommodates more than 1 million residents in informal settlements, most of whom are tenants (KNBS 2012). The severity of the living conditions in Nairobi's informal settlements (particularly Kibera) has been widely documented (for example, Bird et al., 2017). In line with previous studies (for example, Prud'homme, Rémy, and Lee 1999; Peralta-Quirós and Mehndiratta 2015), we measured job accessibility based on the number of jobs accessible within a certain range of travel time from a residence or neighborhood. Second, we investigated who has better or worse job accessibility in Nairobi by focusing on poorer people and residents of informal settlements. The analysis utilizes a recently collected household survey, the Cities Baseline Survey, which is representative of both the formal and informal residential areas in Nairobi. Finally, we analyzed the trade-off Nairobi residents face in selecting residences by examining the link between job accessibility and housing rents in the city. When housing rents are determined in equilibrium in functioning (even informal) housing markets, the rents reflect job accessibility among other characteristics (Rosen 1974). We estimated hedonic regression models to examine the costs of better job accessibility in Nairobi.====Our analysis illustrates how job accessibility is linked to the spatial distributions of housing rents and poverty in Nairobi. We found that Nairobi's average job accessibility is indeed limited. By spending 30 min traveling, Nairobi residents can, on average, reach 2 and 4 percent of existing jobs by foot and minibus, respectively. They can reach 7 and 24 percent of jobs within an hour by foot and minibus, respectively. Given the fact that a large fraction of Nairobi residents—particularly low-income individuals—walk to work, this limited job accessibility must have created considerable inefficiencies in the labor market. Moreover, we found that the job accessibility of poorer households and/or residents of informal settlements is overall worse in Nairobi. Compared to richer households (in the fourth per-capita consumption quartile), poor households (in the first per-capita consumption quartile) can, on average, reach 20 percent fewer jobs by foot within 60 min. Similarly, the number of jobs that residents of informal settlements can reach by foot within 60 min is 30 percent less than residents in formal residential areas. Our hedonic regression analysis demonstrates that it is costly to live in housing with better job accessibility in Nairobi, explaining in part why poorer households have such limited job accessibility.====Our findings illustrate the need to assess and enhance access to economic opportunities for disadvantaged workers in African cities, and Nairobi is a case in point. While the poverty headcount ratio in Nairobi declined from 21 percent in 2005/06 to 17 percent in 2015/16, the number of poor residents slightly increased during this period (KNBS 2018). Despite the overall low poverty rate, nearly 30 percent of residents in informal settlements still remain in poverty (World Bank 2018). More than 20 percent of the poor in Nairobi are unemployed, and about 40 percent of the poor are casual workers. The 2015/16 Kenya Integrated Household Budget Survey (KIHBS) also showed that only 15 percent of the poor use a minibus for commuting, while 70 percent of the poor walk to work. Despite the concentration of poverty, worse living conditions, and limited job accessibility in Nairobi's informal settlements, it is difficult for many residents to pursue living arrangements elsewhere. In such situations, it is critically important to enhance job accessibility to support the poor and/or residents of informal settlements to escape from poverty.====Our research is related to three bodies of literature. First, our work is related to the literature focusing on job accessibility from a perspective of agglomeration economies. Facilitating a better match between firms and workers is, among other channels such as sharing and learning effects, a critical component of agglomeration economies (Duranton and Puga 2004). A body of empirical studies estimated the effects of city size and density on productivity, though most of them focused on developed countries (see Combes and Gobillon 2015 for a review). Limited job accessibility could, however, restrict such benefits of agglomeration economies. Viewing cities as labor markets (Bertaud 2014), studies have assessed accessibility, measured as the number of opportunities an individual can access within a given amount of time, for Buenos Aires (Peralta-Quirós and Mehndiratta 2015), Dakar (Stokenberga 2017), Nairobi (Avner and Lall 2016), and a group of eleven cities in Africa (Peralta-Quirós et al., 2019). We advance the Nairobi study by Avner and Lall (2016) by focusing on accessibility to ==== instead of ==== proxied by land use.====A second line of literature our work is aligned with is that on spatial mismatch. Originally developed by Kain (1968) for the racial segregation context in the United States, the spatial mismatch literature argues that unskilled workers who are segregated away from job opportunities tend to be unemployed and have lower wages due to high commuting and job search costs (see a review by Gobillon and Selod 2014). This is relevant to African cities as well. A randomized control trial (RCT) conducted in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, found that providing a transport subsidy to disadvantaged job seekers increased their chance of finding better jobs (Abebe et al., 2017; Franklin 2018). Analyzing such causal impacts of job accessibility on labor market outcomes must follow detailed assessments of job accessibility for disadvantaged workers. Our study aims to provide such diagnostics of job accessibility among Nairobi residents by paying specific attention to informal settlements.====Finally, our research is related to the literature on hedonic regression analysis for housing prices. The urban land use theory (Alonso 1964; Mills and Hamilton 1995; Muth 1968) explains how the rent gradient over distance from the central business district (CBD) is determined in a monocentric city. In reality, however, jobs are not necessarily concentrated in the CBD. We add to the hedonic regression literature by estimating the link between job accessibility and housing rents, by explicitly including housing in informal residential areas. Various studies have estimated hedonic regression for informal housing in the developing world, including Gulyani et al. (2012) and Marx et al. (2019) for Nairobi and Nakamura (2017) for Pune, India.==== Atuesta et al. (2018) found a clear link between job accessibility and housing values in Mexico City.====The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the context about job accessibility challenges in Nairobi. Section 3 discusses the methodology by explaining various data sets and analytical methods employed in this study. Section 4 presents the results on the job accessibility calculated for the city, the levels of job accessibility by different household groups, and hedonic regressions. Section 5 concludes with a brief summary of the findings.","Spatial distributions of job accessibility, housing rents, and poverty: The case of Nairobi",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137720300796,9 December 2020,2020,Research Article,92.0

This paper provides the first estimates of both housing/commuting bid functions of heterogeneous households and the associated bid-function envelope. This approach clarifies the distinction between movement along a household's bid function and a change in the slope of the envelope caused by household sorting. It also leads to tests of the hypotheses that households sort according to the slopes of their bid functions and that higher-income households tend to live farther from worksites. Estimates based on house sales in the Cleveland area in 2000 largely support these two hypotheses and indicate that the price of housing may be as much as one-third lower at a location that is 34 minutes from a worksite than it is at a location that requires a minimal commute, all else equal.","The relationship between access to jobs and housing prices is at the core of standard models of urban residential structure. In the most basic model, identical households value access to jobs, and the equilibrium housing price function, also called a bid-rent function (or a bid function for short), indicates how much more a household would pay for housing in a location with better job access. As explained by Alonso (1964) and many subsequent studies, this logic can be extended to a model containing multiple household types, each with its own bid function. In this case, the observed housing price function is the envelope of these bid functions, and the model sheds light on a key feature of American cities, namely, the sorting of households by income and other traits. Although the distinction between bid functions and their envelope is well known, it has been neglected in related empirical research. As Duranton and Puga (2015, p 350) put it, “close to nothing is known regarding the effect of income heterogeneity on the various gradients.”====This paper draws on the hedonic analysis of amenities in Yinger (2015b) to extend the literature by deriving bid functions that allow for households to differ on observed and unobserved traits, solving for the envelope of this bid-function family, and estimating this envelope using detailed data on house sales in the Cleveland area in 2000. The key assumptions in this derivation are that the demand for housing takes a constant-elasticity form and that the hedonic equilibrium, defined as the relationship across household types between job access and bid-function slopes, takes a polynomial form with parameters that can be estimated.====The approach in this paper has several advantages. First, it can accommodate many different measures of job access, including linear distance, street distance, time along streets, and measures that account for multiple worksites. As explained in Section 2.5, the measures selected for the analysis of the Cleveland data are the ones that appear to best explain homebuyers’ commuting cost perceptions or that are closely linked to urban theory. Second, it is compatible with standard models of housing hedonics, which control for multiple housing and neighborhood characteristics. Third, it estimates a derived envelope for the household bid functions and thereby eliminates the confusion in the empirical literature between movement along a household type's bid function and a change in the slope of the envelope caused by the sorting of different household types into different locations. Fourth, it accounts for the possibility that households’ transportation costs and demand for housing—and hence their housing bids—are influenced by many traits, both observable and unobservable, not just by income. Finally, it leads to tests for two key hypotheses about urban residential structure: that households sort according to the slopes of their bid functions and that sorting based on access to jobs is “normal” in the sense that higher-income households tend to live farther from worksites.",The price of access to jobs: Bid-function envelopes for commuting costs,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137720300784,9 December 2020,2020,Research Article,93.0

Yet, little is known regarding how job loss risk affects home ownership via the mobility channel. Measuring this effect is difficult because job loss risk usually coincides with income and credit shocks. We isolate the mobility channel by studying economics professors on the tenure track. Our analysis uses public records to provide the first quantitative estimates of this effect, and we validate our results with a follow-up survey. A one percentage point increase in expected mobility, identified via variation in tenure risk, reduces the probability of home ownership by up to 1.8 percentage points.","Understanding the connections between home ownership and geographic mobility is important in many fields of economics, including labor, urban, and macroeconomics, with enormous implications for public policy. It is well understood that home ownership increases the transaction costs of moving and thereby lowers migration rates (Molloy et al., 2011).==== Possible adverse consequences include greater income and wealth inequality, longer unemployment duration, and lower aggregate TFP.==== Despite these costs, the U.S. income tax code subsidizes home ownership to the tune of $400 billion annually (Sinai and Gyourko, 2004). Former President George W. Bush famously promoted an “ownership society,” stating, “It is in our national interest that more people own their own home.”==== Economists have also theorized that the lower migration rates of homeowners might entail positive externalities, because owners are “better citizens” and invest more in their communities (DiPasquale and Glaeser, 1999).====Given the enormous stakes involved, it is important to understand both how home ownership affects geographic mobility, and the reverse: how geographic mobility affects home ownership. The idea that higher expected mobility causes individuals to delay home ownership is so fundamental that it appears in almost every urban and real estate textbook (e.g., Brueckner, 2011, chapter 6). Despite this, the literature on estimating the magnitude of this effect is surprisingly sparse.====In this paper, we provide the first empirical estimates of how expected mobility affects home ownership. To do so, we study job loss risk among a select group: tenure-track assistant professors of economics (APs). In the general population, job loss also represents a negative income shock when insurance is incomplete (the ====). This makes mortgage payments less affordable, and financing more difficult to obtain should the household need to move. Moreover, if job loss occurs in a negative home-equity environment, then double-trigger models suggest that mortgage default is more likely, which will raise future borrowing costs (the ====). But in a high-demand field such as economics, job loss is essentially decoupled from income and credit shocks. Studying APs thus allows us to cleanly isolate the ==== alone.====This special setting has two additional advantages. First, the “up-or-out” structure of the tenure track provides an ideal institutional setting for measuring job loss risk. Second, moving to another geographic location is usually a direct implication of job loss for APs. Indeed, our analysis highlights the importance of local job scarcity: expected mobility is attenuated, and the impact of job loss risk on home ownership is weaker, for APs living in cities where outside jobs are more available. A potential disadvantage of this setting is that the link between job loss and mobility is probably not generalizable to the broader population. However, we expect that the link between mobility and home ownership should be similar in both populations. We confirm this using data from the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations (SCE), indicating that our identification strategy provides externally valid estimates of the effect of geographic mobility on home ownership.====To frame the analysis, we develop a structural model that motivates a concise, estimable econometric framework. In Section 2, we begin by presenting a continuous-time model of how expected mobility should theoretically affect the decision to buy or rent. This model is unique in that it explicitly considers the role of uncertainty about when the household will move. Greater uncertainty reduces the propensity to buy: i.e., both the probability and the timing of moving matter. In Section 3 we present a sufficient statistic combining these two attributes, which we call the ==== (PDP). This is the key explanatory variable in our econometric framework. Importantly, we show that instead using only short-term probabilities in a regression analysis attenuates the estimated impact of expected mobility toward zero. Hence, another rationale for studying APs is econometric: the entire course and timing of events on the tenure track are predetermined and measurable.====We construct and leverage two unique data sets. First, in Section 4 we describe how we hand-coded historical college catalogs to create a database of all 1413 tenure-track careers that occurred at the top 50 public university economics departments between 1995 and 2016. We then search public records for deeds indicating home purchases by the 348 individuals still on the tenure track at these institutions as of the 2015–2016 academic year. Section 5 presents our main analysis of this dataset: we find that a 1 percentage point increase in the probability of job loss this year reduces the probability of home ownership by up to 1.8 percentage points on average, and the marginal effect is largest where expected mobility is highest. Second, in Section 6 we describe how we conducted a survey of these same 348 individuals. The responses from 144 individuals who completed the survey in full allow us to control for confounding factors including risk aversion and geographic preferences. The responses both corroborate and provide context for our primary results.====Economics APs are undoubtedly a special and selected group: they are younger and higher-income than the general population, and moving is a more necessary consequence of job loss than in other occupations (e.g., investment bankers in New York City hardly ever have to move). In Section 7, to consider the external validity of our main results, we turn to the SCE, a nationally-representative survey of U.S. households. We find a significant negative relationship between expected mobility and home ownership in the general population, and it is similar in magnitude to the effect of expected job loss on home ownership in our survey of assistant professors. This reinforces that a particular advantage of studying APs is the strong link between job loss and mobility.====This paper is related to a number of other studies concerning links between the housing market and the labor market. A large literature, beginning with Oswald, 1996, Oswald, 1999 considers the question of how home ownership limits mobility (now known as the “Oswald hypothesis”; see also Munch et al. (2006) Munch et al. (2008), and Battu et al. (2008)). A separate “lock-in” hypothesis argues that the credit costs of severing from an underwater mortgage reduce the tendency to move (see Henley (1998); Chan (2001); Dietz and Haurin (2003); Engelhardt (2003); Ferreira et al. (2010); and Sterk (2015)).==== Few papers consider the reverse perspective of how labor market conditions affect home ownership, the focus of this study. A notable exception is Hsu et al. (2018), who show how unemployment insurance may cushion the decline in home ownership during economic downturns by preventing mortgage defaults.====Our contribution is to study a separate, expected mobility channel through which ==== labor market risk affects the home ownership decision. Job loss risk has continuously decreased since the Great Recession, and interstate mobility in the 2010s was at a 30-year low (Kaplan, Schulhofer-Wohl, 2012, Kaplan and Schulhofer-Wohl, 2017, Molloy et al., 2014). And yet, home ownership fell to a nearly 50-year low in 2015.==== If the effect of geographic mobility on home ownership is large, then this further deepens the declining-home ownership puzzle (Goodman, Pendall, Zhu, 2015, Goodman and Mayer, 2018).==== Moreover, the changing nature of jobs (the “gig economy”), as well as changing perceptions about job loss risk among Millennials who were scarred by the Great Recession, could have implications for the future of home ownership in coming decades.","Job loss risk, expected mobility, and home ownership",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137720300693,19 November 2020,2020,Research Article,94.0

According to our new measure, the timing and amplitude of the recent house-price cycle differs materially but plausibly from commonly-used measures, which are based on survey data or repeat-sales price indexes. Thus, our methodology generates estimates that should be of considerable value to researchers and policymakers interested in the dynamics of aggregate housing wealth.","Owner-occupied housing is a major component of households’ balance sheets.==== As a result, changes in the aggregate value of owner-occupied housing (“housing wealth”) can affect aggregate consumption and savings and, by extension, macroeconomic outcomes such as economic growth and business cycles.==== However, housing wealth is quite difficult to measure (as we will discuss below), which has made it difficult for researchers to reliably observe its dynamics. In an effort to improve the measurement of housing wealth, this paper introduces a new method to make use of local property value estimates that are derived from machine learning algorithms applied to detailed data on property sales and characteristics from public records and other sources. We combine these property value estimates with housing unit counts from the Census to derive new estimates of aggregate U.S. housing wealth from 2001 to 2018. Our estimates show considerably more responsiveness to changing market conditions than survey measures and somewhat less volatility than repeat-sales measures, highlighting some of the key biases plaguing these commonly used estimates of housing wealth. Thus, our methodology generates estimates that should be of considerable value to researchers and policymakers interested in the dynamics of housing wealth and the role that it plays in economic outcomes.====The difficulty in measuring aggregate housing wealth stems from the inherent difficulty in measuring individual property values. Transaction prices, which are the best measure of a home’s value, are relatively infrequent for a given property, with years or even decades between sales. Consequently, commonly used measures of individual house values have typically been based on homeowners’ reports from surveys or extrapolated from previous sales using changes in a repeat-sales price index. Research has found both of these methods to be flawed in distinct ways. For example, studies have found that owner-reported estimates of house values are biased up on average, perhaps because owners are overly optimistic. Moreover, owners appear to have difficulty identifying market turning points, causing the bias to fluctuate over the housing cycle.==== Other studies have shown problems with using repeat-sales price indexes, due in part to the fact that the properties that are sold are not always representative of those that are not sold. This bias may also be cyclical, as the degree of difference between transacting and non-transacting homes may shift systematically over the housing cycle.==== By extension, aggregate housing values constructed directly from survey data or by extrapolating from a given base using a repeat-sales house price index will also be affected by these same biases.====The method of measuring housing wealth that we develop in this paper uses an automated valuation model (AVM), which can be loosely thought of as an algorithm that combines information on a home’s characteristics, neighborhood features, nearby sales, and homes listed for sale to produce an estimate of the home’s current market value. Although versions of AVMs have been in use for decades, private companies have recently created much more sophisticated and comprehensive AVMs by combining very large and detailed property-level datasets with machine-learning algorithms to impute values of individual housing units to large swaths of residential real estate in the U.S. This combination of big data and machine learning techniques offers the potential for more accurate estimates of housing values – especially during market turning points – than those based on surveys or repeat-sales indexes.====The estimates of aggregate housing wealth that we construct are based on an AVM created by Zillow, a private real estate and data analytics firm that provides estimated home values for over 100 million properties in the U.S. Constructing our measure of aggregate housing wealth is not as simple as adding up the value estimates of all properties in the Zillow data. Zillow’s AVM coverage, while extensive, is not universal. Moreover, Zillow’s estimates include some rental properties that we do not want to include in our measure of aggregate housing wealth and that we cannot easily identify. We address these issues by combining the AVM data with data from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS). Specifically, we calculate the quantity of owner-occupied housing units by property type and county from the ACS and multiply these quantities by the average value of homes in each market segment (county and property type) as determined by Zillow’s AVM. In Sections 4 and 5, we validate our method by carefully investigating the properties of the AVM estimates and the representativeness of the sample on which these estimates are based. Where we can, we test for potential bias in our new measure.====Our method yields new, high-frequency (quarterly or monthly) estimates of aggregate owner-occupied housing wealth from 2001 to 2018, thereby offering a fresh look at the dynamics over the recent housing cycle. We find that from 2001 to 2006, the AVM estimates are largely in line with estimates based on owners’ reported values in surveys such as the annual ACS, the biennial American Housing Survey (AHS), or the triennial Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF). By contrast, our measure diverges notably from survey measures from 2006 to 2012, a time period that includes an enormous housing bust and a gradual recovery. In particular, the AVM-based measure turns down earlier and falls by much more than survey measures based on owner reports. This result is consistent with prior research suggesting that survey respondents were either unaware of the market fluctuations in real time, or that they believed that their home values were different than those in the surrounding market. To the extent that owners did acknowledge changes in the market in their survey responses, it appears that they were late to do so.====The AVM-based measure also differs from the measure of housing wealth that was reported in the Federal Reserve’s ==== prior to 2019Q2 which was largely driven by changes in a repeat-sales house price index from 2005 onward. Specifically, while the contraction in wealth and subsequent recovery in the AVM measure is more pronounced than it is in the survey measures, the cycle is less pronounced in the AVM measure than in this older (pre-2019Q2 vintage) ==== measure. We interpret this result as illustrating the possibility that repeat-sales indexes overstate the effect of market changes on aggregate housing wealth because they inaccurately extrapolate the house price dynamics of transacting homes to all homes. Note that as a result of the analysis presented in this paper, Federal Reserve staff switched to the AVM-based measure in the ==== starting in 2019Q2, generating substantial revisions to housing wealth for the period 2001–2019. Throughout the remainder of this paper, we will use “====” to refer to the older, price-index based measure against which the new AVM-based measure contrasts.====We view one of the contributions of this paper as showing how data that are collected in the private domain for other purposes can be combined with survey data to produce an aggregate time series for use in national statistics. Researchers are currently engaged in applications that attempt to make use of such data to measure a variety of aggregate outcomes including retail spending, services consumption, employment, and business formation.==== Consistent with these studies, one lesson from our analysis is that privately generated data may still need to be augmented with other data sources in order to construct nationally representative statistics.====Another contribution is showing how machine learning techniques (as used in Zillow’s AVM) can be used to improve estimates of aggregate housing wealth.==== Perhaps most importantly, our findings suggest that studies that use self-reported values from surveys to examine fluctuations in house values or housing wealth could be understating quite severely the cyclical changes in aggregate wealth. Since housing wealth is such a significant part of total household wealth, any bias in owner-reported home values in turn affects the measurement of cyclical dynamics of household net worth. Our results also suggest that economists and policy-makers using repeat-sales price indexes to measure aggregate wealth might overstate the size of the housing wealth cycle. Especially because housing wealth measurement has the potential to affect results in a wide range of studies, the discussion and findings in this paper should be of interest to researchers and policy makers interested in quantifying the economic effects of cyclical fluctuations in wealth.====A final contribution of the paper is illustrating just how challenging it is to measure housing wealth. We show that different, ==== plausible methods yield notably different aggregate time series. While our new, AVM-based measure clearly addresses some known shortcomings of older, alternative methods, we do not view it as the last word on the matter. Going forward, our basic approach could be improved both through advancements in the underlying AVM (perhaps as more data and more sophisticated statistical techniques become available) and through improvements in the linking of these AVM values to the relevant unit-count totals. Housing wealth is an area where measurement is important and fundamentally challenging.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

If we can determine why renters move, lawmakers can design housing policies to foster positive mobility and reduce negative mobility. The purpose of this paper is to build on prior models of renter mobility to develop a conceptual model that can be mapped to the various effects of mobility. Within the model, I identify reasons for (im)mobility that may be receptive to housing policy intervention. As an illustration of the model, I use a difference-in-difference-in-difference (DDD) model and data from the 1981–2014 March supplements of the Current Population Survey (IPUMS-CPS) to show how various landlord-tenant policies impact the frequency of renter mobility. I use the conceptual model to hypothesize the nature of the relationship between public policy and mobility. Results indicate policies regulating late fees and self-help remedies play a role in reducing renter mobility. While all policies tested here do not have a significant effect on renter mobility, the impact of some policies highlights the need for targeted, evidence-driven interventions.","American housing policy focuses on encouraging homeownership as a way of fostering family and neighborhood stability. Literature suggests frequent mobility is especially detrimental to children, leading to poor health (Desmond and Kimbro, 2015) and disciplinary problems (Ersing et al., 2009; Haynie and South, 2005). Neighborhoods with high mobility rates, which scholars associate with less civic engagement and trust among community members (Temkin and Rohe, 1998), crime and gang activity (Boggess and Hipp, 2010; Dupéré et al., 2007), environmental stress (Schulz et al., 2008), and lower levels of neighborhood attachment and satisfaction (Taylor, 1996), are less stable than neighborhoods with lower mobility rates. However, rental housing can benefit society because it encourages labor mobility while reducing housing investments for those who cannot or do not wish to own a home (Green, 2011; Mayo and Stein, 1995; Oswald, 1997, 1996). There is a growing understanding why renters choose to move likely plays a role in whether these outcomes will be positive or negative. Some scholars distinguish positive==== (often called voluntary) and negative (involuntary) mobility (Clark and Onaka, 1983; Phinney, 2013; Rossi, 1955), under the assumption that public policy should encourage positive mobility and discourage negative mobility.====The simple distinction between voluntary and involuntary mobility misses some of the nuance highlighted by Desmond (2016). Involuntary mobility takes many forms, from formal eviction—when a court order forces renters to leave their homes—to an annual rent increase which induces a renter to move to a more affordable unit. Understanding these distinctions can help target public policies to the particular causes of mobility that may be detrimental to society. The purpose of this paper is to build on prior models of renter mobility by distinguishing between the various types of involuntary mobility, creating a refined conceptual model of renter mobility, and highlighting ways public policy influences the decision to move. Policymakers and scholars can use this model as a framework for designing policy interventions aimed at increasing positive mobility while decreasing negative mobility.====Using the conceptual model, I theorize about the nature of the relationship between policy and renter mobility. Specifically, I use a DDD methodology and data from the 1981 to 2014 March supplements of the Current Population Survey (IPUMS-CPS) to compare the mobility rates of renters and homeowners in states that did not adopt six landlord-tenant policies and in states that did, both before and after policy adoption. Results indicate policies regulating late fees and self-help remedies play a role in reducing renter mobility. Non-retaliation may also reduce renter mobility, but that relationship should be interpreted cautiously because it is sensitive to model specification. While all policies tested here do not have a significant effect on renter mobility, the impact of some policies highlights the need for targeted, evidence-driven interventions.====This paper contributes to the rental housing policy literature in several ways. First, while other authors address the scope (Hatch, 2017), legal justification and challenges (Brakel and McIntyre, 1980; Carroll, 2008; Piccard, 2006), and housing quantity and quality consequences of landlord-tenant policies (Been and Glashausser, 2009; Collins, 2004; Hirsch et al., 1975; Tighe et al., 2017), limited research exists on the effects of these laws on renters. This paper examines the consequences of landlord-tenant laws on one outcome—renter mobility. Second, the conceptual model I develop and test highlights the importance of understanding how these laws influence renter mobility and whether variations in rates represent a change in socially beneficial mobility. Finally, the empirical model sets the stage for further research on the impact of landlord-tenant policies on renter outcomes.","Voluntary, forced, and induced renter mobility: The influence of state policies",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137720300267,30 May 2020,2020,Research Article,96.0

The calibrated model can match several stylized facts of the labor market and the housing market in the United States. Our counterfactual policy analyses suggest that public housing and housing voucher programs have similar welfare implications on the household level. However, within a household, the public housing program tends to benefit the children more than the parents, while the housing voucher program delivers the opposite result. Combining the school finance consolidation policy with the public housing program could improve the well-being of children from poor households without hurting other households’ welfare. Some policies’ short-run welfare implications can deviate significantly from their long-run counterparts when all choices are optimized.","The United States practices ”local public finance,” where K12 education is substantially financed by local property tax. The public school is then provided to heterogeneous agents within the same community at zero price. Therefore, the housing market is linked to the education of children. The competitions for housing in well-funded school districts, would drive up house prices, and drive out relatively low-income families.==== The peer group effect literature informs us that quality of education tends to increase with the proportion of students from high-income families (Sacerdote, 2011, Stinebrickner, Stinebrickner, 2006). As a result, offsprings from disadvantaged families could receive lower-quality education and are more likely to remain less privileged as adults.====Can appropriately designed policies mitigate this intergenerational persistence in income phenomenon? To address this question, we develop a simple spatial general equilibrium model with the peer group effect and local public finance in this paper. We show that housing policies such as public housing and housing voucher programs, and education policies such as school finance consolidation interact with one another and sometimes produce unexpected consequences. Thus, we complement the literature on housing policies, which mainly relies on partial equilibrium analysis (Currie, Yelowitz, 2000, Olsen, Ludwig, 2013).====The general equilibrium approach provides an avenue for understanding households’ decisions and outcomes in a systematic fashion and allows us to analyze the feasibility of specific policies. For example, housing market policies, such as public housing and housing voucher, often impose additional tax burdens on non-participants, which might bring political resistance. While a partial equilibrium setting may take the tax as given, our model can partially address this issue in two ways. First, the property tax rate is determined through majority voting within the community. Second, we attempt to find a Pareto-improving policy, i.e., to improve some members’ welfare and let no other get hurt. Such a policy would be easier to receive support from voters. Notice that a Pareto-improving policy may be feasible in the present context because many forms of market imperfections exist in the housing and education markets====More specifically, our model is a variant of the Hanushek-Yilmaz (HY, henceforth) framework, which incorporates all the externality and market imperfections discussed above.==== In an HY economy, households choose among the ex-ante identical communities for residence, given the school quality and property tax rate pair (Tiebout, 1956). Within a community, families also make the tradeoff between commuting costs and spatially-differentiated rents in locational decisions (Alonso, 1964). Thus, the HY framework links the housing market and education through local public finance, embedding the peer group effect and spatial elements in a unifying framework.====Our contribution hinges on making two realistic modifications to the HY framework. Our first modification is to differentiate between the well-being of parents and offspring explicitly. The level of parental investment in offspring well-being becomes a choice variable and can differ across households. Also, parents decide the intra-household allocation of goods and residence space. Hence, different families can respond to policy changes differently, and we can assess both the intra-household and inter-household welfare changes across policy regimes. The second modification is to model the peer group effect as a function of the average quality of the peers (e.g., Blume and Durlauf, 2006, which, in turn, depends on their parents’ investment and per capita educational spending of the local government. In contrast, previous Hanushek-Yilmaz papers assume peer group effects only depend on population composition, such as the fraction of educated parents within a community. To highlight the importance of this modification, we repeat our policy analysis under an alternative specification where the peer group effect only depends on the population composition. As we now note in a footnote and show in the appendix, our formulation could lead to quantitatively different policy implications from the case where the peer group effect only depends on population composition.====With both discrete choices (e.g., which community to reside) and externalities (e.g., peer group effect, public education budget) in the model, it may not be feasible to estimate the parameters using a reduced-form approach directly. Instead, we follow the path of existing HY papers. More specifically, we calibrate our model to match several stylized facts of the U.S. economy circa 2010, enabling us to ”identify” parameter values that might not be directly observed and ensure that our model is consistent with those stylized facts. We perform counterfactuals based on the calibrated model to analyze the implications of housing and education policies. Concerning the effects of housing policies, we find that building public housing units for the poor can improve the well-being of their offspring and themselves at the cost of hurting the rest of the economy. The average welfare also declines as location choices are restricted, and the incentives to work are distorted. However, we also find that a policy that combines the public housing program with school finance consolidation can be effective (aiding the poor) and efficient (Pareto-improving). Intuitively, this is the case because, in contrast to the results in Hanushek, Yilmaz, 2007, Hanushek, Yilmaz, 2013, we find that school finance consolidation can improve welfare for all households, based on our calibrated model. We provide more discussion and intuition in Section 3.====Our policy experiments yield additional results. First, it is better to locate the public housing units on the ”edge of the city,” i.e., the land that would not be occupied without the public housing program. The intuition is that such an arrangement of public housing units would not reduce the amount of accessible area. Second, on the ==== level, housing voucher provides similar welfare results as public housing policy does. However, their implications on the ==== level differ. Adequately designed public housing policy can benefit the adult members in low-income families and improve the well-being of their children. In contrast, while we still find an increase in the well-being of the less educated parents under the housing voucher program, their children’s well-being is impaired. We also compare the short- and long-run welfare implications of public policies in the context of our model and find that there is a possibility that they would differ. To our knowledge, such comparison is relatively rare in the spatial general equilibrium literature and would hopefully enrich our understanding.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We first present a modified version of the HY model and deliver the baseline results. The model-generated rent gradients are compared with the empirical findings as a validity test of the model. We then analyze the welfare consequences of introducing various housing policies and consolidating school finance, both in the short- and long-run.

This is the first correspondence field experiment investigating discrimination against this minority group in Portugal, and the first one to highlight religion as a factor of importance. In our experiment, four type of applicants varying in gender (male and female) and modality (same and opposite sex) reply to Internet ads to express interest in renting an apartment in the metropolitan areas of Porto and Lisbon. All applicant couples are presented as married, stable and professional. The main finding is that male same-sex couples face significant discrimination: The probability of getting a positive reply is 7–8 percentage points, or 23–26 percent, lower for them compared to opposite-sex couples. Interestingly, this effect is ==== in the religiosity of a parish, suggesting that the more religious, Catholic and religiously homogenous people residing there are (with certain qualifications), the less discrimination of male same-sex couples there is. Further results reveal that discrimination is stronger when the population is older and when the rent and the square-meter price of apartments are higher. The present study extends the literature to a southern European, Catholic setting, validates previous research documenting worse treatment of same-sex couples in the housing market and demonstrates a mitigating effect of religiosity under certain conditions.","Discrimination has a number of costly consequences, which makes it important to document the extent to which it occurs and what determines its scope.==== Against this background, the purpose of this study is to find out to what degree same-sex couples face discrimination on the Portuguese rental market. Even though attitudes towards same-sex couples have improved a great deal in Portugal in recent decades, and even though legislation bars discrimination and has become more inclusive (European Commission, 2019; Mendos, 2019), it might still be the case that an opposite-sex couple is preferred by many landlords over a same-sex couple.====The method used in this study is a correspondence field experiment and is, to our knowledge, the first such test performed in Portugal to measure whether same-sex couples are discriminated against. As such, it pioneers in providing a more objective measure of discrimination for this minority group compared to surveys, and it helps us see whether previous studies in other countries documenting discrimination are verified in a southern European setting.====Also, for the first time in the correspondence field experiment literature on discrimination based on sexual orientation, we pay special attention to ==== in the population as an explanatory factor. There is a large literature on attitudes towards homosexuality among religious people, and most results indicate that these attitudes are negative, which merits taking this factor (in our case, Catholicism) into account.====We sent e-mails from four types of fictitious couples (male-male, female-female, female-male and male-female) to potential landlords in the Porto and Lisbon rental markets on the basis of online ads. The results suggest high discrimination against male same-sex couples, who were 7–8 percentage points, or 23–26 percent, less likely to receive a positive reply from a landlord. Interestingly, up to quite high shares of self-identified religious people and Catholics in a parish, more religiosity entails ==== discrimination. The same mitigating effect follows from more religious homogeneity. This suggests that many religious people interpret their Catholicism such that one should not treat same-sex couples worse than others in matters of housing.====Furthermore, discrimination of male same-sex couples is most prevalent in parishes with an older population and a higher population density, and it increases when the objects had a higher rent or higher price per square meter and decreases, up to a point, with distance to the center. We find no indication of statistically significant discrimination of female same-sex couples.====This paper adds to an emerging literature using correspondence field experiments to study discrimination of same-sex couples in housing markets in Sweden (Ahmed et al., 2008; Ahmed and Hammarstedt, 2009), Canada (Lauster and Easterbrook, 2011), Germany (Mazziotta et al., 2015), Serbia (Koehler et al., 2018), Ireland (Ahuja and Lyons, 2019) and the United States (Schwegman, 2019). With the exception of the German case, there is evidence for significant levels of discrimination for male same-sex couples applying for housing, while female same-sex couples seem to face no such discrimination. None of these studies investigates how religiosity affects discrimination.====The primary contributions of the present study, then, are that it provides evidence of discrimination in a new context – a Catholic, southern European country – and that it incorporates religiosity as an important factor.",Religiosity and discrimination against same-sex couples: The case of Portugal's rental market,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137720300656,3 September 2020,2020,Research Article,102.0

Whereas the ==== policy involves randomly assigning previously ineligible pupils to key elementary schools through lotteries, the policy of ==== consolidates ordinary primary schools through alliances with elite schools.

Indeed, Heckman (2011) argues that investment in early childhood education not only promotes economic efficiency, but also enhances equity at the same time. Moreover, there is growing evidence that parents value school quality when they make school choices (e.g. Koning and van der Wiel, 2013 and Burgess et al., 2015).====However, there is substantial inequality in education in China (Zhang and Kanbur, 2005), both between and within regions. The so-called system of “key schools and universities” dated back to the early 1950s, when the People's Republic of China introduced its Five Year Plan, “in order to cultivate higher quality specialized talent for the country and rapidly promote the development of science and culture in China” (Tan and Wang 2016). While both types of schools are publicly funded, a key primary school (KPS) is perceived to offer substantially better education quality compared to an ordinary primary school (OPS) due to higher per capita funding, better teacher quality, and highly favourable student socio-economic backgrounds (You 2006). However, the detrimental effect of key schools on education equity has become an increasing concern for the policymakers and the public. Following the introduction of 9-year compulsory education, the authorities formally prohibited ==== from the compulsory education stage in the 1990s. Nevertheless, parents still seem to highly value those traditional elite schools, even without the official labelling. In response to parental demand for access to quality schools, the educational authorities in Beijing have attempted to extend the coverage of KPSs. According to our sample, the proportion of students attending a KPS in Beijing has increased from 39.6% to 46.5% between 2013 and 2016.====It has been half a century since Wallace Oates published the seminal paper on the capitalization of local property taxes on house values (Oates (1969)). Since then, a growing number of studies have contributed to the literature on school quality capitalization under different contexts such as countries of study, school quality measures and methodological innovations. See Ross and Yinger (1999), Gibbons and Machin (2008), Black and Machin (2011) and Nguyen-Hoang and Yinger (2011) for reviews.====In this paper, we add evidence to how school (re-)designation affects house prices across school districts, using a complex dataset we collected from three different sources. The phenomenon of steeply priced “(key) school district houses (====)”, i.e. properties which give access to prestigious publicly funded schools, has consistently been one of the hottest topics in the Chinese media in recent years.====Using a panel data of ==== (RCs), also known as school attendance/catchment zones, derived from comprehensive data on real estate transactions in Beijing over the period 2013–2016, we investigate how house prices react to policy changes which aim to equalize access to quality publicly-funded elementary schools. We start off by estimating the spill-over effects of public education quality on house prices in Beijing using the hedonic price model. The results indicate that, after controlling for features of properties, as well as neighbourhood and location characteristics, the mean house price in KPS catchment areas is about 6% higher than that of OPS catchment areas in the Ordinary Least Squares specification.====Furthermore, we allow for systemic differences between the treated and non-treated RCs using ==== and account for the common trend in house price inflation using the ==== approach. Our ==== estimates indicate that the effect on house prices of becoming eligible to enrol in a municipal-level KPS is about 4–8%, while the premium for becoming eligible for a district-level KPS is only about 2–3%. The price impacts of the three different channels are broadly comparable to each other. Our findings are also robust to two alternative measures of primary school prestige based on the number of awards in academic tournaments or subjective rankings by parents.====Our paper is similar to Feng and Lu (2013), the only causal study of the effect of school quality on house prices in China published in English to date. Using a DID approach, they find that the re-designation of the status of an ordinary high school to a specific high-quality school status increases the house price in its residential area by 6.9% in Shanghai. Compared to their study, our paper addresses the potential endogeneity bias arising from the non-random school designation policies through a matching DID strategy. We also undertake extensive heterogeneity and robustness analysis using two different tiers of KPSs and two alternative classifications of key schools. Furthermore, we explore three different channels through which the school re-designation may affect housing prices.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows.

This is because homeowners face higher mobility costs that limit their job search to local labor markets. Empirical tests of this prediction have yielded mixed results so far, possibly due to the endogeneity of homeownership. This paper proposes that the privatization of public housing in Central and Eastern Europe after the fall of the Iron Curtain was a substantial policy shock that generated largely exogenous assignment of homeownership to individual households. This facilitates a new test of the effects of homeownership on mobility and unemployment: First, our empirical results do not reject that homeownership reduces mobility. Second, our results are inconsistent with homeownership increasing unemployment.","Previous research often finds that homeowners, all else equal, are less likely to move residence than renters (see Dietz, Haurin, 2003, Van Ommeren, Van Leuvensteijn, 2005, for overviews). In a seminal paper, Oswald (1996) argues that this should lead to higher unemployment risks, longer unemployment duration, and lower wages among homeowners. This is because lower mobility decreases the value of job offers in distant labor markets, limiting homeowners’ job matching opportunities compared to renters.====Since its publication, a large number of contributions have tested various aspects of the “Oswald hypothesis.” We add to this literature by studying housing privatization in the transition countries of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and using it as a source of exogenous assignment of homeownership to estimate the effects of homeownership on labor mobility and unemployment risks.====Understanding the labor market effects of homeownership is important for a number of reasons, three of which appear crucial to us: (i) People frequently strive to become homeowners, because owning a home may provide long-term security, allowing them to set roots, and start a family.==== Homeownership therefore seems to have an intrinsic social value. (ii) However, if homeownership increases unemployment, societies may face a tradeoff between these two policy variables. (iii) Public policies tend to cater to the preference for homeownership but without explicit regard for the labor market repercussions of those policies (see e.g. Laamanen, 2017). Knowledge of the labor market costs of homeownership is therefore required for housing policy to be set optimally and to strike a reasonable balance between the social benefits and costs of homeownership.====Previous literature documents a number of channels linking homeownership to immobility. These include homeowners’ higher moving and transaction costs (Dohmen, 2005, Goodman, 1995, Haurin, Chung, 1998, Haurin, Gill, 2002, Oswald, 2019, Quigley, 2002, Van Ommeren, 2008), mortgage lock-in effects (Quigley, 1987), lock-in effects related to transaction and capital gains taxes (Best, Kleven, 2017, Hilber, Lyytikäinen, 2017, Lundborg, Skedinger, 1998, Lundborg, Skedinger, 1999, O’Sullivan, Sexton, Sheffrin, 1995, Slemrod, Weber, Shan, 2017, Van Ommeren, Van Leuvensteijn, 2005), homeowners’ higher investments in local social capital (DiPasquale and Glaeser, 1999), loss aversion (Engelhardt, 2003), as well as mobility expectations and preferences (Lux, Sunega, 2012, Rohe, Stewart, 1996). Most of this literature finds that homeownership is associated with reduced mobility. However, two recent studies by Hilber and Lyytikäinen (2017) and Slemrod et al. (2017), studying discontinuities in housing transfer taxes, do not find significant distortive lock-in effects that would limit labor market mobility.====The empirical evidence concerning the effects of homeownership on unemployment is even more ambiguous (see Havet and Penot, 2010, for a review). Aggregate-level studies generally find a positive correlation between unemployment and the share of owner-occupied housing, both within and across countries (Blanchflower, Oswald, 2013, Green, Hendershott, 2001, Isebaert, Heylen, Smolders, 2015, Oswald, 1996). Individual-level studies, by contrast, tend to find that homeowners, if anything, do better on the job market than renters in terms of unemployment risk, its duration, and wages (Barceló, 2006, Battu, Ma, Phimister, 2008, Coulson, Fisher, 2002, Coulson, Fisher, 2009, Flatau, Forbes, Hendershott, 2003, Munch, Rosholm, Svarer, 2006, Munch, Rosholm, Svarer, 2008, Rouwendal, Nijkamp, 2010, Van Leuvensteijn, Koning, 2004).====An important methodological issue faced by this literature is the endogeneity of homeownership status. It is not clear, for instance, whether individuals become immobile because they acquire homes or whether less mobile individuals are more likely to opt for homeownership. Previous literature has mostly relied on instrumental variable approaches to identify the causal effect of homeownership on unemployment risks. The instruments used in this literature include the regional homeownership rate (DiPasquale, Glaeser, 1999, Munch, Rosholm, Svarer, 2006, Munch, Rosholm, Svarer, 2008, Van Leuvensteijn, Koning, 2004), regional price-to-rent ratios at the time of buying a house (Baert et al., 2014), tax deductions of mortgage interest and same-sex siblings (Coulson and Fisher, 2009), inheritance of money in young years (Gardner et al., 2001), dummies for US states (Green and Hendershott, 2001), or homeownership rate in subjects’ region of birth and her parents’ homeownership status (Munch et al., 2008). All of these are, however, subject to criticism. For instance, the much used regional homeownership rate has been criticized on account of potentially having a direct impact on labor market outcomes and also potentially being correlated with neighborhood characteristics that are in turn correlated with individual-level labor market outcomes (Blanchflower, Oswald, 2013, Coulson, Fisher, 2009, Laamanen, 2017). Similarly, although the same-sex of first two siblings predicts the presence of a third sibling, and thus can be thought as an exogenous housing demand shifter, it is also likely to affect parents’ labor market outcomes through different channels than homeownership, violating the exclusion restriction.====Only few papers explicitly search for quasi-experimental evidence to assess the impact of homeownership on economic behavior. Wolf and Caruana-Galizia (2015) use the allied bombing campaign during the Second World War as an instrument for homeownership, finding a large positive effect on unemployment and a negative effect on mobility. However, one may find it difficult to assume that the economic effects of flattening German cities worked exclusively through homeownership. Laamanen (2017) argues that the deregulation of rental housing markets in Finland in the early 1990s created an exogenous variation in homeownership rates across regions. Higher profits from renting led to increased supply of rental dwellings, lowering homeownership rates in the regions that were subject to the deregulation. He finds that homeownership generates negative externalities in the form of increased unemployment. However, it is not entirely clear whether the identified effects pertain exclusively to homeownership or, instead, to the rental market deregulation itself as it could have spurred economic activity in deregulated regions, or both. Instrumenting homeownership in the former East Germany with pre-1990 homeownership status, Gebhardt (2013) finds that ownership increases asset-specific investment, such as bathroom renovations. He argues that because homeownership under the communist regime was economically meaningless, it was essentially randomly assigned. This observation is also relevant for the interpretation of our results, as it suggests that endogeneity of homeownership might generally be a lesser issue in the case of transition economies.====The closest paper to ours is a recent study by Sodini et al. (2016), who exploit aborted privatization of public housing units in Stockholm to assess the effects of homeownership on a number of outcomes, including mobility and labor income. They find that homeownership induces households to work harder, increasing their labor income and—in contrast to previous literature—that homeownership increases household mobility. However, their data does not allow for an analysis of the effects of homeownership on unemployment. We complement (Sodini et al., 2016) in that the experiment we study, i.e. housing privatization in Central and Eastern Europe, was a large-scale transfer of homeownership to renters whose move in decisions have taken place before the Fall of the Iron Curtain, that is in the absence of standard housing and rental markets. Therefore, in our case the assignment of homeownership status prior to privatization differs since the main factors driving homeownership versus renting decisions in standard market economies were absent (Gebhardt, 2013).====Our methodological argument, which we consider to be the main innovation of the paper, is the following: Housing privatization in CEE countries was a result of a difficult-to-predict event: the fall of the Iron Curtain. It took the form of transferring property rights over publicly-owned housing units to the sitting tenants at substantially discounted rates (relative to market prices) and was predominantly organized at the central-government level. This led to a situation where (i) upon moving in, renters of housing units that were later privatized could in no way anticipate the privatization of their unit; (ii) decisions regarding which housing units would be designated to be privatized were beyond the direct control of individual tenants; and (iii) individuals had a high incentive to privatize and thus to comply with the “treatment”. Thus, housing privatization approximated an exogenous assignment of homeownership to individuals. This facilitates a new test of the effects of homeownership on individuals’ labor market behavior and outcomes.====We, therefore, provide new estimates of the effects of homeownership on mobility and unemployment. To this end, we use data on ten CEE countries from the Life in Transition Survey (LiTS).==== In addition, we use the East German sample of the German Socio-Economic Panel covering the post-1990 period. This data allows us to explicitly control for unobserved heterogeneity and tap into the role it may play in explaining the empirical relationship between homeownership and unemployment found in the existing literature. Finally, we extend the evidence concerning the labor-market effects of homeownership, which has been primarily studied in the mature market economies of Western Europe and the United States, to post-socialist countries in Central and Eastern Europe.====Our results are summarized in two points. First, our empirical tests do not reject that homeownership reduces mobility; indeed, the estimated effects tend to be negative and the confidence intervals contain substantively large effects. Second, our results are inconsistent with homeownership increasing unemployment; in fact, the estimated effects are systematically negative, although the confidence intervals contain small positive effects. These results hold across geographic regions, alternative specifications, and across the two estimation strategies in the two datasets we analyze.","Homeownership, mobility, and unemployment: Evidence from housing privatization",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137720300644,8 August 2020,2020,Research Article,104.0

Zoning separates citizens into neighborhoods by income. This maximizes total surplus and facilitates redistributing gains to a majoritarian governing coalition of citizens, which changes from rich to poor as the city grows. Non-members of the coalition may form suburbs. These theoretical results are supported by empirical facts compiled by Schnore and Varley (1955). It is difficult to justify stratified zoning on Paretian grounds, even when a municipal government can redistribute income. If stratified zoning is not a Pareto improvement before gains are redistributed, it will not be afterward under majority rule. Gains in total surplus increase as the distribution of income becomes less equal, which helps explain why neighborhood stratification has outpaced stratification of income in U.S cities in recent decades, as documented by Booza et al (2006) and Sampson (2016).","Central cities impose many restrictions on the use of residential land. To explain, describe, and evaluate these restrictions, I construct an intra-municipal urban sorting model in which citizens differ by income and housing is semi-rival and semi-excludable in consumption, similar to a clubs good.==== Previous literature on neighborhood externalities focuses on single neighborhoods, and most previous literature on urban sorting is based on multiple municipalities. I model multiple neighborhoods in a single municipality, since much sorting occurs within central cities.====A common restriction is a minimum on the size of lots, historically often a quarter of an acre in the U.S., or a maximum on the number of units on a given plot, but restrictions may also apply to architectural standards, such as façade requirements. Restrictions that decrease density necessarily increase commuting time. Locally, under some allocations, at least, people seem to prefer low density to high density even after netting out the extra commuting costs. This view was validated by Bucovetsky (1984), who concludes that minimum lot size zoning increases the price of new housing and decreases the price of residential land.====Henderson (1985b) is critical of zoning ==== land: “Of course, minimum lot size zoning is not an efficient way to raise ====, in the sense that ==== could be raised more (for any alternative utility level) if, for example, all inputs into the production process could be zoned and raised by the same percentage.” White (1975) compares zoning that restricts only consumption of land to zoning that restricts consumption of land and housing capital. In practice, using land alone to correct for the housing externality would favor citizens with strong preferences for land, both their own and that of their neighbors, relative to other inputs to housing. It would lead to high consumption of gasoline, pollution, and long travel times, and would make public transportation cost-ineffectual by making neighborhoods “spread out”, so people would have far to drive to non-residential activities and far to walk to a bus or train.====Perhaps these concerns, but mostly the kind of increase in the cost of housing identified by Bucovetsky, have motivated a few U.S. cities, and one large state, recently to go the other way and ease maxima on density.==== At other allocations, when the price of housing gets high enough, people may not prefer a combination of low density and high commuting costs. The present theoretical model is valid so long as the minima imposed on consumption of the various aspects of housing are targeted to those aspects for which the people intended are willing to pay the equilibrium price, which might reflect diminishing marginal utility of neighborhood as quality increased, but density declined. The suburban commuting cost specified in this model should be thought of as ==== to the cost of an intra-city commute.====Work on neighborhood externalities includes that of Schall (1976) and Stahl (1976). They identify cooperative and non-cooperative equilibrium levels of investment in housing in dynamic contexts. The literature on urban sorting, beginning with Tiebout (1956), is extensive. Much of it focuses on trade-offs between existence of equilibrium and “efficiency” in the provision of local public goods when citizens self-select to income-homogeneous municipalities. There is also substantial literature on zoning itself, which overlaps with that on neighborhood effects and sorting. Historical reviews of theoretical and empirical literature on zoning are Pogodzinski and Sass (1990) and Pogodzinski and Sass (1991), respectively.====Much of this literature, including Epple and Platt (1998), also allowed for locational differences in the price of housing. Like Epple and Platt, I assume that land is homogeneous. Though I generally assume that the marginal product of land is equalized across uses, so that all land is priced alike, I show that the allocations I derive are robust to this assumption. I show in Appendix A that there exist prices that do vary by location that also support the allocations I derive without locational variation in the price of land.====Henderson (1985a; p. 249) argues that models without an “adjustment mechanism for land uses across the fixed number of communities to equalize the marginal products of land” do not derive “long-run solutions, but might deal with what could be termed temporary equilibria in an unspecified dynamic context.” He cites empirical evidence that numbers and boundaries of communities are flexible in the United States. In the long-run, a city, including its business districts and neighborhoods, need not exist. Their costs are not sunk, and the business districts, neighborhoods, and suburbs may reform or relocate to supplant any part of surrounding land, whose marginal value in agricultural use may be assumed not to vary by location or quantity supplied. Therefore, the long-run opportunity cost of urban land use need not vary by location or quantity consumed, either. It is analytically convenient to assume that the price of urban land equals this long-run opportunity cost, so the price of housing equals its long-run marginal cost, but, again, the allocations derived are also equilibria at prices that may vary by location.====Zoning is about as common as stratification, which is quite common, suggesting that zoning is not superfluous. According to Epple (2003; p. 189), before Ellickson (1971), “there was a widespread view among urban economists that zoning or other governmental restrictions were needed to maintain the stratification of households by income across municipalities that is commonplace in U.S. metropolitan areas.” With Ellickson, the urban sorting literature began to derive equilibria with separation that existed without restrictions on consumption of housing but, rather, that depended on a ""single-crossing property"" derived from some modest restrictions on preferences. “Epple and Platt rely on a Cobb-Douglas specification for utility and use a numerical example to demonstrate that a sorting equilibrium [with incomplete income stratification across communities and income heterogeneity within communities] exists.”==== I also use Cobb-Douglas, which satisfies Ellickson's single-crossing property in ==== space, where ==== is a neighborhood housing externality, and ====is the price of housing.====Therefore, when I, like Epple and Platt, allow the price of land to differ by location, I find that stratification is an equilibrium without zoning, but that, in the present model, this equilibrium is neither unique nor stable. Zoning, therefore, will be necessary and will be used to effect sorting in a long-run economic and political outcome. I return to the pre-Ellickson view, but in an intra-municipal model. The pre-Ellickson view may be theoretically retrograde, but the idea that zoning regulations both bind and stratify has some up-to-date empirical support. According to Chapple et al (2017),====While implementation of ADU's reduces stratification, the observation that MLR's and other regulations are binding and stratifying provides some support for a hypothesis that a long trend toward greater stratification in the U.S. was implemented through zoning.====The contribution of this article, however, is not mainly to revive the pre-Ellickson view. An interesting implication of the model is that governing coalitions in small (large) central cities will be formed from the upper (lower) portion of the distribution of income, and poorer (richer) people may form suburbs. In mid-size central cities, governing coalitions will be formed from the extremes of the distribution of income, and not from the middle class, and the middle class may form suburbs. This theoretical result explains empirical facts documented by Schnore and Varley (1955). Further, I prove that if stratified zoning is not a Pareto improvement before redistribution of its social benefits, it will not be a Pareto improvement afterward, either, under a majoritarian government. Losers ==== redistribution will be non-members of the governing coalitions: the poor in small cities; the middle class in mid-size cities; and, interestingly, the rich in large cities. Thus, though stratified zoning maximizes total surplus, which is the objective function of a Kaldor-Hicks welfare criterion====, it is difficult to justify on the grounds that maximization of that criterion makes a Pareto improvement possible, under majoritarian democracy. I conclude that stratified zoning would be easier to justify if it required the approval of representatives from all parts of a city.====The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the right of municipalities to impose restrictions on consumption of housing that differed by location in Euclid v. Amber (1926). Justice Sutherland described negative externalities associated with low consumption of housing, which is economically equivalent to positive externalities of high consumption:====Sutherland does not regard an apartment house as “residential”. Moreover, he does not explain why traffic, darkness, noise, air pollution, danger, and the deprivation of children of quiet and open spaces for play would be “highly desirable” if concentrated in an environment other than “more favored localities”. I will argue here that central cities will use zoning to internalize the positive externalities of housing, which benefits all citizens, and to separate rich neighborhoods from poor ones, which improves the neighborhoods of the rich and makes the neighborhoods of the poor worse, and that the net of these two effects on the poor is empirically negative. I will also argue that, under majority rule, in small cities the poor will not be able to compel others to make them whole for the losses they incur. In large cities, they will, but they will not stop there. They will tax the rich until the gains of the rich become losses.====In Section 2, I describe a model of a city with multiple neighborhoods and citizens who differ by income. In Section 3, I derive outcomes first without zoning, second when zoning merely bans “substandard” housing throughout the city, and third when the government can impose restrictions that differ by location. I discuss the properties of these outcomes in terms of efficiency and implementability. In Section 4, I describe the outcome of citywide voting on zoning policy. In Section 5, I discuss the distributional consequences of this outcome.

In this study, we introduce online listing information as an innovative data source for house price index construction, using China's housing resale markets as an example. Compared with alternative data sources, such as the officially-registered transaction information of housing resales, our analysis shows that online listing data provide a better trade-off between accuracy, reliability, and feasibility, especially after the resolution of potential replicated and/or manipulated data issues using our proposed procedures. Based on the cleaned online listing information, we calculate the first housing resale price indices covering almost all (274) Chinese cities. In particular, for around 200 relatively smaller cities, the index provides the first regular house price indicator, which shows a significant divergence in house price dynamics between different tiers of cities. We also briefly discuss the potential extensions of the listing price index, including the daily house price index and the housing rental price index.","Construction of a high-quality house price index has become increasingly important due to sharp house price fluctuations in major economies. A timely, accurate house price index with broad coverage plays an essential role in decision making for both market participants and policymakers, as well as in housing market analysis and academic researches. Several recent studies have also emphasized that monitoring house prices is especially important but challenging in nascent housing markets such as China (Ciarlone, 2015; Guo et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2014, 2016).====Existing literature on house price index constructions mostly focuses on the methodological perspective. Besides the conventional hedonic (Kain and Quigley, 1970) and repeat sales (Case and Shiller, 1987) methods, recent studies also introduce several innovative concepts, such as the matched (Francke, 2010; Guo et al., 2014; Jiang et al., 2015; McMillen, 2014), quantile regression (Liao and Wang, 2012; McMillen and Thorsnes, 2006), and semi-parametric (Hill and Scholz, 2017; Karato et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2019) methods. However, much less efforts have been made from the raw data source perspective. Currently, most existing house price indices rely on transaction or appraisal data, both of which have been revealed to expose to potential problems (Deng et al., 2018; Silver, 2016). In particular, in nascent housing markets such as China, the lack of reliable price information has become the key obstacle to further improving regular house price monitoring.====In this study, we introduce online listing information as an innovative data source to construct house price indices in China's housing resale market. Currently, most listing information for housing resales in urban China is posted online and can be automatically and freely collected, and thus offers significantly better accessibility compared to transaction information. Nevertheless, online listing information still poses its own problems in the context of nascent housing markets, especially in terms of replication and manipulation of data. Therefore, instead of directly introducing the procedures developed by Anenberg and Laufer (2017) based on the multiple listing services (MLS) system in the U.S., we develop a set of procedures to carefully remedy these potential problems before using the listing information in the house price index construction. The empirical evidence from 16 sample cities suggests that, the price index based on the cleaned online listing information can well reflect both the long-term trend and short-term fluctuations of actual transaction prices. In particular, it is more reliable than the resale transaction price information officially registered in local housing authorities, or even the existing official house price indicator in China.====The high data accessibility of the online listing information makes it possible to extend the scope of regular house price monitoring from major cities to most of the cities in China. Based on cleaned online listing information, we develop the first set of house price indices covering the housing resale markets in almost all (274) cities across the country between 2015 and 2019. In particular, for around 200 3rd or 4th tier cities, the index provides the first indicator which is able to trace their monthly house price dynamics regularly. It thus can serve as the cornerstone of high-quality analysis and research of these increasingly important markets. We find significant divergence in house price dynamics between different tiers of cities; in particular, both the extraordinary house price surges and housing market recessions concentrate in some smaller cities. Meanwhile, we note that house prices in smaller cities near megacities tend to follow the megacities’ trends. According to the results, the existing house price indices focusing on major cities only may lead to a biased understanding of the overall housing market conditions in China, a large country with substantial regional disparities.====Additionally, we briefly discuss the potential extensions of the online listing information in house price index constructions. First, while most existing house price indices are on a monthly or quarterly basis, a growing body of literature highlights that a high-frequency house price index is of great importance (Anenberg and Laufer, 2017; Bollerslev et al., 2016; Deng et al., 2017). We provide an example of a daily listing price index for housing resales in Beijing, which can provide rich details in short-term house price dynamics, and thus can benefit not only housing market analysis but also investment decision making. Second, the procedures developed in this study also apply to the collection and cleaning of online listing information of housing rental transactions, facilitating the construction of housing rental price index. We make a preliminary attempt by calculating a set of monthly rental price indices in 35 major cities in 2015–2019. It can reflect changes in living costs and, or even more importantly, help better identify the potential divergence between house prices and the fundamental factors (Davis et al., 2008; Gallin, 2008; Sinai and Souleles, 2005).====Although a few previous studies, such as Anenberg and Laufer (2017), have raised the idea of applying listing information in house price monitoring, this study contributes to the literature by exploring nascent housing markets. First, and most importantly, unlike the case of Anenberg and Laufer (2017) in the U.S., where the well-developed MLS platform provides high-quality listing information, the major challenge for an immature housing resale market like China comes from the poor quality of the original listing information. Therefore, this study strives to develop a cleaning process to identify replicated and manipulated listing information before adopting such information in house price monitoring. Second, in mature housing markets such as the U.S., the listing price mainly serves as complementary information to the already-comprehensive housing market indicators. By contrast, in a nascent market like China, the listing price may be the major, or even only, feasible house price information source for a large number of relatively smaller cities. As a most important contribution, our new index provides the first available house price measure that can be regularly updated for over 200 relatively smaller Chinese cities.====This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides background information of China's housing resale market and discusses the feasibility of adopting listing data as a new data source for house price monitoring. Appropriate methodologies for data collection, cleaning, and index construction are introduced in Section 3, especially focusing on how to deal with replicated and manipulated listing data. Section 4 provides empirical evidence on the reliability of the listing price index, by comparing the listing price indices with the indices based on actual resale transactions in 16 sample cities. Section 5 presents the listing price index for housing resales in 274 cities, while Section 6 further discusses the potential extensions in two aspects.

Theory predicts that property tax limits increase non-labor income during the housing boom and decrease non-labor income during the bust periods, leading to opposite effects on labor supply during the boom and bust periods. Exploiting exogenous variation of housing market conditions in the housing boom and bust and geographic changes of property tax limits in the cross-state Combined Statistical Areas, we test the theory and find that property tax limits reduced female labor force participation by 0.7 to 1.4 percentage points during the housing boom (2005–2006) as predicted. In contrast, the impact of property tax limits on female labor force participation during the housing bust (2008–2009) is always positive but not statistically significant in most specifications. These results are consistent with our model and provide new evidence of housing wealth effects in the labor market.","California's Proposition 13, which California voters approved on June 7, 1978, is one of the most famous tax policies in U.S. history.==== Since then, more states have enacted measures that limit the ability of local governments to tax residents for local services. A large literature has emerged to understand the impact of property tax limits on local government fiscal conditions and government expenditures on public services, as well as the quality of these services.==== Others seek to investigate the effects of property tax limits in the housing market, e.g., how property tax limits affect housing prices and housing stock.==== Theory suggests that property tax limits should also have impacts on household behaviors in the labor market, such as mobility and labor supply. Ferreira (2010) and Imrohoroglu et al. (2014) find that property tax limits affect mobility. However, no study so far has looked at the impact of property tax limits on labor supply.====This paper seeks to fill the gap by analyzing the causal impact of property tax limits on female labor supply. Labor supply is often highly inelastic for males, so female labor supply responds more to policy changes and income shocks. The literature typically find a greater income elasticity of labor supply for females than for males (McClelland and Mok, 2012). A simple theoretical model shows that the effects of property tax limits on female labor supply in the housing boom and bust periods are in opposite directions because property tax limits have opposite effects on individual non-labor income during the boom and bust periods. In short, in the housing boom, property tax limits cause higher house value growth and lower property tax growth in areas with property tax limits relative to areas without such limits. The opposite is true in the housing bust. In particular, property tax limits lower the fluctuation of the assessed housing value in a bust if the assessed housing value is not increasing much in the boom in the first place.==== We then test the model predictions empirically and establish a causal link between property tax limits and female labor supply by exploiting exogenous variations of housing market conditions caused by the recent housing cycle and geographic changes of property tax limits in the cross-state Combined Statistical Areas (CBSA).====Investigating the relationship between state property tax limits and female labor supply makes several important contributions. First, it provides new evidence of housing wealth effects in the labor market using a new source of exogenous variation. The wealth effect on leisure consumption and labor supply is a fundamental economic question, but it is difficult to identify due to classical endogeneity concerns. Scholars have tried to resolve the challenge by using exogenous shocks of wealth created by inheritance, lottery gains, housing vouchers or rental subsidies, and housing price fluctuations (Joulfaian and Wilhelm, 1994; Fischer, 2000; Imbens et al., 2001; Hurst and Lusardi, 2004; Jacob and Ludwig, 2012; Fu et al., 2016; Zhao and Burge, 2017). This paper adds to the literature by presenting another piece of evidence that housing wealth changes affect labor supply using exogenous variation from the changing effects of property tax limits in the housing cycle.====Second, this study contributes to the ongoing debate on property tax limits and thus has important policy implications. Advocates of property tax limits often argue that governments are spending too much and that increasing property taxes force elderly and low-income families to sell their houses. The opposing side claims property tax limits cause distortion of government spending behaviors and other unexpected consequences, such as reducing household mobility. This paper documents another unexpected consequence of property tax limits: Property tax limits may distort female labor supply decisions in the housing cycle. This paper is also among the few studies that investigate property tax limits on a national scale with a keen focus on identification. Hoyt et al. (2011) conduct a national analysis on the effects of property tax limits in the housing market. Most other studies focus on a specific state. One potential reason is that it is difficult to collect information on property tax limits in different states. Thus, another contribution of this study is an updated review of state property tax limit policies. We cross-validate the law coding in previous studies on property tax limits and double-check with various state websites. We correct a number of omissions of law coding from previous studies.====Third, this paper relates to the literature on determinants and spatial variation of female labor supply. Women's labor supply has been the subject of numerous studies because it is often the margin of adjustment in response to policy changes and is the key to proper policy interventions. Understanding the determinants and spatial variation of female labor supply is vital to policy-making. Fortin (1995) analyzes the effects of mortgage qualification constraints on female labor supply and finds that a nontrivial percentage of women are constrained by mortgage commitments. Black et al. (2014) find a large variation in the labor supply of women across cities and focus on cross-city differences in commuting time as a potential explanation. The findings in this paper suggest that property tax limits, combined with local housing market fluctuations, are another potential contributor to the overall trend and cross-location variation of U.S. female labor supply.====There are two related empirical challenges to identifying a causal relationship between property tax limits and female labor supply. The first is that voters approved property tax limits in response to specific state housing market trends. Unobserved local attributes that affect housing market trends may also correlate with individual labor market decisions, in which case property tax limits are endogenous in labor supply equations. The second is that people may self-sort across state borders based on utility maximization. In other words, unobserved household attributes in different states may be different and can change over time. If these unobserved attributes are systematically correlated with labor market decisions and local housing market trends, the estimates on the effects of property tax limits can be biased.====Several features of our modeling design help to address the identification challenges. First, we limit the empirical analysis to female homeowners in CBSAs that span state lines.==== This border identification approach is widely used in the literature following the seminal work of Holmes (1998).==== An implicit assumption is that unobserved local attributes on different sides of the state borderline in the same CBSA take on similar values, reducing the degree to which unobserved local attributes bias the results.==== Since CBSAs are defined by the U.S. Census Bureau such that most residents in a CBSA are in the same labor market, this assumption is reasonable. Also, the border regions are small relative to their respective states. State policies are unlikely to be affected by the labor and housing market conditions of the border CBSAs.====A second feature of our modeling strategy is that we exploit exogenous variation of housing market conditions in the recent housing boom and bust and adopt a double differencing strategy that draws on comparisons across state borderlines and time. To do this, we focus our empirical analysis on a short housing boom period (2005–2006) and a short housing bust period (2008–2009).==== For the housing boom period, we compare the change of female labor supply from 2005 to 2006 in the part of each CBSA with property tax limits to the change of female labor supply from 2005 to 2006 in the part of each CBSA without property tax limits. The exogenous variation of housing market conditions in the recent housing boom and bust combined with state differences on property tax limits create differentiated non-labor income shocks across the state borders, which we use to identify the causal impact of property tax limits on female labor supply. The comparison results should be interpreted as the incremental change in the impact of property tax limits on female labor supply from 2005 to 2006. This is a non-standard difference-in-difference (DID) model in the sense that the policy variable in the model is a change in treatment intensity that is not from 0 to 1. One advantage of this model is that moving across states is very limited within just one year. More importantly, double differencing relaxes the identification assumption: We only assume the change in unobserved local attributes from 2005 to 2006 on different sides of the state border in the same CBSA take on similar values. We do the same for the housing bust period.====The concern about sorting across states based on unobserved individual characteristics remains even after the double differencing. Women in states with property tax limits may be different from women in states without such limits in terms of unobserved attributes. Other state policies may also affect female labor supply. In addition, because our DID model is non-standard, it may subject to more caveats than standard DID models. Thus, as a final feature of our identification strategy, we use female renters and prime-age men as additional comparison groups and conduct triple difference regressions.==== Triple differencing in this manner further controls for sorting based on unobserved characteristics across state borders and other policies that differ across states but impact owners and renters equally within a state (or women and men, depending on which comparison group we use). We think the triple differencing results are more reliable than the DID results. In addition to the above identification strategies, we control for a rich set of individual characteristics, spouse's characteristics, and state-level variables that may affect female labor supply decisions.====We reach several conclusions. First, we find that property tax limits indeed impact female labor force participation. Second, the effects of property tax limits on labor force participation are quite different in the housing boom and bust periods. Theory predicts that women would reduce labor supply in the housing boom and increase labor supply in the housing bust due to property tax limits. The empirical results are consistent with the model predictions. Depending on the specification, women are less likely to join the labor force by around 0.7 to 1.4 percentage points due to property tax limits during the housing boom (2005–2006). In contrast, the impact of property tax limits on female labor force participation during the housing bust (2008–2009) is positive but not statistically significant in most specifications. Third, we find no effect of property tax limits on hours of work for the female population.====In this study, we mainly focus on binding property tax limits, but we also compare the impact of different types of property tax limits. We find that rate limit and assessment limit alone do not have significant effects on female labor supply. However, when they present at the same time and constitute a binding limit, their joint effects tend to be larger and more likely to be statistically significant. Revenue limit, as a binding limit alone, has a statistically significant impact in most specifications. Further analysis suggests the impact of property tax limits is larger for married women and areas with stronger housing price fluctuations. We also find strong heterogeneity of the impact across different education and age groups. We also conduct a series of robustness checks to show the robustness of our main conclusions.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

We exploit a rich data set on housing prices from the UK Land Registry – transactions prices for ==== residential property sales in England and Wales – as well as detailed information from the UK Home Office on asylum seeker flows and their accommodation across the UK. Using two empirical strategies – one based on panel data methods relying on spatial and time variation of asylum seekers receiving housing support, the other based on time variation in aggregate asylum flows into the country – we find that asylum seeker flows have had small but non-trivial negative effects on local house prices, especially for lower-priced and lower-quality housing units. Results from panel data suggest that an increase in asylum seekers leads to outward movement of the local population, a result commonly found in the literature. Results using time series data on aggregate asylum seeker flows indicate stronger negative effects in areas that voted for ‘Brexit,’ which may reflect negative local attitudes toward foreigners and immigrants. Both empirical approaches pay careful attention to properly identifying the causal effects of asylum seeker dispersal on local housing markets.====By ‘asylum-seeker dispersal’ we refer to Section 95 support in the UK’s Immigration and Asylum Act of 1999, which guarantees housing accommodation to asylum seekers whose claims are ongoing, subject to a destitution test. Thus, the number of asylum seekers covered by the UK dispersal scheme is typically not captured by standard refugee or immigration numbers.====The literature on the economic effects of overall immigration, particularly on local labor markets and productivity, is vast and remains both contentious and relevant for policy debate.==== Less work has been directed toward understanding the economic effects of the UK dispersal policy and asylum seekers, ====. Asylum seekers are typically different from other immigrants: they tend to be less educated and more destitute, and the path to their participation in the labor market is less clear. Consequently, they are likely to impose larger burdens on national budgets and local populations than other immigrants. In addition, destitute asylum seekers receive accommodation on a no-choice basis. Thus, unlike traditional immigrants, location choice is not based on utility maximization of the household, a fact documented by the study of Stewart (2011), on how asylum seekers relocate after asylum is granted. Finally, while traditional immigrants are in general evenly distributed throughout the country, the burden of the UK dispersal policy is only shared between a few local authorities. As Figure 1 shows, only 26 local authorities accommodated 75% of all dispersed asylum seekers in 2015, while over two-thirds of local authorities housed none. This unequal distribution of asylum seekers puts additional strain on local infrastructure. In light of the European refugee crisis – more than one million refugees flowed into Europe in 2015 because of war and strife – a full understanding of how national and local economies respond to the flow of refugees and asylum seekers is essential to good policy and international relations. The aim of our study is to contribute to this understanding.====The importance of housing markets in the economy, at both national and local levels, is well-understood and documented. Housing accounts for around 60% of the total wealth of European households. Not only are housing prices and construction good indicators of an economy’s health since they respond to many underlying shocks, housing markets can spillover to overall economic activity through direct effects on spending or through the ability of homeowners to borrow with collateral. The housing market is also likely to be directly influenced by the inflow of asylum seekers. Thus, our focus on measuring the effects of housing dispersal of this subset of immigrants on housing prices is well motivated.====How asylum-seeker flows affect local housing markets is purely an empirical question. Clearly, dispersal of asylum seekers can directly increase the demand for housing, putting upward pressure on housing prices. Native preferences to this inflow can then either enforce or offset the direct effects of asylum seekers. If asylum seekers are perceived as a negative shock to local public amenities or drive down wages of local workers, or if domestic residents do not have a taste for cultural diversity, then native outflows can offset the upward price pressure. Additionally, dispersal may affect the quality of the housing stock if governments invest less in maintenance, or may trigger domestic flight from local communities, which would further aggravate the strain on local house prices. Our reduced form estimates account for the equilibrium response of housing prices to these flows, after all of these direct and indirect effects work through local housing markets.====Our empirical work is guided by a simple theoretical model of housing that distinguishes domestic residents from asylum seekers in their demand for housing. The model can be interpreted as one of a housing market in a mono-centric locality, as in Alonso (1964), Muth (1969) and Mills (1967), and has been the foundation of much empirical work on immigration and house prices such as Saiz, 2007, Saiz, 2010, Saiz and Wachter (2011) and Sá (2015). Most applications of these models assume that immigration is exogenous to local housing markets (e.g. Saiz, 2007 (p. 349) and Sá, 2015 (p. 1398), although both account for potential endogeneity in estimation); however in Britain the choice of how to disperse asylum seekers to a large extent depends on housing prices themselves. We extend the standard housing model, in light of the legal background and dispersal procedures used in Britain, to account for endogeneity of dispersal. Section 2 describes these procedures, while the first part of section 3 describes the theoretical model.====The second part of section 3 lays out the empirical models we estimate. Based on the predictions of the theoretical model, we employ two estimation strategies to identify the effects of interest. The first is restrictive in that we assume the response of housing markets to fluctuations in the number of local asylum seekers is constant across local authorities. We do so to rely on panel data estimators to control for unobserved heterogeneity. Here we use annual time series data from 2004 through 2015 for all 347 local geographic districts across England and Wales.==== As noted, dispersal across these districts is not plausibly exogenous with respect to the effects we seek to estimate; thus, our main inference comes from instrumental variables methods which are described and justified in section 3.2. Our instruments rely on spatial correlation across locations for their strength, and we argue below that exclusionary restrictions for the instruments are likely to hold. However, endogeneity bias could still affect our estimates if spatial correlation in the data is due to unobservables that we do not control for, and that lead to correlation between local house prices and asylum seekers. Our results are robust to adding controls to our benchmark model for this possibility, but acknowledge that some mis-identification might remain.====After describing the data in section 4, we report and discuss the panel data estimates in section 5.1. Given the richness of the house price data, we also provide estimates for a wide range of sub-samples that account for different segments of housing markets based on property types (e.g., flats, detached dwellings), and house-price quartiles. The sub-samples help to refine the interpretation of our benchmark findings and allow consideration of distributional effects.====Our second strategy relies only on time variation in the total number of first time asylum applicants seeking entry into the UK. Because the aggregate population of asylum seekers into the UK is plausibly exogenous with respect to local housing market effects, being driven primarily by political and economic factors abroad, asylum-seeker flows can thus help identify the effects on local house prices.==== Clean identification is a major advantage of this approach, but it also allows us to relax the restriction that housing market effects are the same across locations. We run time series regressions of average local house prices on total asylum seekers entering the country separately across local authorities that participate in the government’s dispersal program, using monthly data going back to 2004, and find that most areas show negative responses. An interesting result is that local authorities that voted in 2016 to leave the European Union – which we take as a rough proxy for local attitudes toward immigrants and foreigners – have systematically different house price responses to asylum seekers than other areas. These time series regression results are summarized in section 5.2.====Our paper contributes to the extensive literature on the economic effects of immigration, but more specifically to the effects of immigration on housing markets and the mobility response of natives. For example, Filer (1992), Fairlie and Resch (2002), and Boustan (2010) show that natives generally respond with outward migration to immigration inflows, which can explain why the effects of immigration shocks on housing prices are quickly arbitraged away. Accetturo et al. (2014), in their study of immigration and house prices in Italian cities, find that natives’ perception of the negative effects of immigrants on local amenities affects those prices. Most local labor market studies find that immigration has little or no impact on wages and labor force participation of the local population because the effects of immigration are quickly spread out to the national labor market (Card, 1990, Borjas, Freeman, Katz, 1996). For the UK this result is confirmed by Dustmann et al. (2005). With respect to housing more directly, Saiz (2003), Saiz (2007), and Gonzalez and Ortega (2013) find a positive relationship between immigration and property values; i.e. an increase in immigration pushes up housing values by increasing housing demand. In contrast, Sá (2015) and Braakmann (2016), whose studies are closely related to ours, show that overall immigration in the UK has a negative effect on house prices. Sá (2015) attributes this finding to the mobility response of high-income natives resulting in a negative income effect, while Braakmann (2016) points towards differences in housing tenure and usage of housing space between natives and immigrants.====Our paper, while closely related to Sá (2015) and Braakmann (2016), adds to the literature along several dimensions. First, as we have noted, asylum seekers are likely to impose larger burdens on national budgets and local populations than other immigrants. This fact is aggravated by the relatively high spatial concentration of destitute asylum seekers in just a few districts. This high concentration of asylum seekers is a direct result of the government’s dispersal policy, rather than utility maximizing households. As Section 2 explains in more detail, the government provides housing for qualifying asylum seekers on a no-choice basis. Consequently, this paper analyses potential adverse effects on house prices resulting from government action rather than household decision making. The mismatch between government action and household choice is confirmed by Stewart (2011) who documents large relocation rates after asylum is granted.====Second, this paper addresses the potential of spatial spillovers. While confirming an outward mobility response of natives, we find no evidence of cross-border spillover effects related to dispersal. Specifically, districts that do not participate in the UK’s dispersal scheme are unaffected by an increase in dispersal in a neighboring district in terms of house prices.====Third, we provide speculative evidence of a novel mechanism to explain our findings: stronger negative effects are found for ‘Brexit’ areas. Although Becker et al. (2017) show that many factors led to the country’s vote to leave the European Union, a tentative albeit plausible interpretation of our results is that negative attitudes toward foreigners, as reflected in Brexit voting at the local level, might well play some role in the negative housing price effects of asylum seekers.====Finally, this paper sheds light on distributional effects of the UK dispersal scheme. We show that lower-priced and lower-quality housing units respond more negatively to inflows of asylum seekers than higher-priced and higher-quality units. This finding is robust to the choice of empirical estimation strategy.====While the papers noted above study the effects of overall immigration, others have focused more closely on refugee and asylum seekers, as in our paper.

These authors, however, are not interested in the effects of immigration, ====. Labanca (2016) treats migration into Italy from the Arab Spring in 2011 as an exogenous event to estimate the effects of refugees on labor markets and employment in that country, and is similar in approach to our study. However, we look at housing, not labor markets, and use data for the UK, not Italy.

Some housing market experts advocate the supremacy of a jump bid, a significant bid increase to discourage fellow bidders, and thereby acquire the dwelling at a lower price compared to bidding strategy with moderate bid increases. We find no evidence for the efficacy of this jump bid strategy. Jump bidders, if successful, pay a positive jump premium. This also applies to the case where the jump is not the final bid and the jump bidder win at a later stage. In this case, the jump bid premium is around 1 to 2%. However, a jump bid is a credible signal of “serious intentions”. Jump bidders tend to win auction more often even in cases, where the jump bid is matched, and the auction continues.","To acquire a home by entering a real estate auction is, for most, a scary endeavor. Bids tend to be several times the bidder’s annual net income, and bid increases may be enough to buy a new car. The bids are naturally placed with care and with the intention to acquire the dwelling at the lowest possible cost.==== In the case of an English auction, classic auction theory is comforting.==== Bids should be raised by small increments (straight forward bidding) (Milgrom, Weber, 1982, Bikhchandani, Riley, 1991). In this case, the bidder with the highest willingness to pay acquires the dwelling at a price close to the second-highest willingness to pay in the group of bidders.==== In contrast, a bid that involves a large bid increase, a jump bid, may surpass the second-highest willingness to pay by an excessive margin. A bidding round is a strategic game, where bids and bid increases serve as signals. There is a burgeoning literature on auction environments where jump bids are perceived to be rational (Ettinger and Michelucci, 2015).====A prospective homeowner is not likely to delve into academic journals and make up her mind regarding what economic auction model she finds adequate and place bids according to its recommendations. She may, however, try to seek advice from “real estate experts”. One such piece of advice (under the title “The correct and smart way to bid”) is:====This advice could make sense if bidders enter the auction with a fuzzy willingness to pay. A jump bid stimulates some bidders to exit early, and the transaction price potentially ends up lower compared to an auction with straight forward bidding.====In this paper, we adopt the bidders’ perspective and ask: Do jump bids work? We address this question empirically by considering a rich data set on auctions in the Norwegian housing market.====We find that jump bids correlate with higher prices. A jump bidder that wins with a final jump may fear that she surpassed the second-highest willingness to pay by an excessive margin. In the case that the jump bid seals the deal, our jump premium estimate is in the 9 to 10% range. This is consistent with that the unmatched jumps on average are too high. More intriguing is that a jump premium in the 1 to 2% range also applies in the case where the jump bidder wins at a later stage. This premium is present even when we control the competitiveness of the auction. This finding is not consistent with the efficacy of a jump bid to deter competition. However, we find that jump bidders win auctions more often, even in the case where the jump was matched, and the auction continues. In other words, a jump bid is a credible signal of determination.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives a brief literature review on jump bids in auctions. Section 3 provides information about the Norwegian real estate auctions. We present institutional details as well as describe how the auction tends to unfold. This “behind the scenes”-information provides some insight into possibilities and limitations of auction signaling. Moreover, we give a brief discussion of bid increments in real estate auctions. Section 4 states different jump bid criteria and gives a jump bid definition. The section also provides summary statistics of dwelling types, hedonic characteristics, and bidding rounds for bidding rounds with and without jump bids. In Section 5, we look at the consequences of jump bids. We find that jump bids correlate with higher transaction prices and explore two possible explanations for this.==== Section 6 consider reasons for jump bids. We explore to what extent they are a response to competitive auctions and whether or not they seem to be an attempt to stress the seller and fellow bidders.

We assess combat exposure in 50,522 Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) participants by combining self-reports of witnessing death through the 2011–2013 survey cycle with military deployment records since September 2001. We use participants’ 2014–2016 MCS survey cycle reports to assess subsequent homelessness. We accommodate uncertainty surrounding limited data with an information theoretic, semi-parametric Generalized Maximum Entropy model. We estimate, on average, a single combat exposure increases the probability of homelessness by about 0.40 percentage points (27% relative to the mean probability) and multiple combat exposures increase the probability of homelessness by about 0.57 percentage points (38% relative to the mean probability). Our model also sheds light on pre-deployment characteristics associated with combat exposure resilience; estimates indicate veterans with poorer pre-deployment mental or physical health and veterans under the age of 30 years are less resilient to the effects of combat exposure on homelessness. Cost calculations with model estimates suggest combat exposure contributed to 4600 veterans experiencing homelessness and $54 million in related public spending.","Veteran homelessness remains a prominent problem in American society. Recent figures by U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) officials suggest about 40,000 veterans are homeless in the United States today (HUD, 2017). Furthermore, U.S. Census Bureau and HUD figures show veterans make up 7.2% of the homeless numbers, despite being only 5.7% of the overall population.==== The gravity of the situation motivates federal spending of roughly $1.5 billion per year to reduce veteran homelessness (Perl, 2015), yet high numbers of homeless veterans persist.====The fact veterans, who all have job experience, are more likely to be homeless than their civilian counterparts is puzzling, and the possibility some military assignments vector veterans toward homelessness remains. We estimate how assignments with combat exposure==== affect homelessness in surviving deployed veterans, considered individuals who served in the military regardless of whether they continue to serve. We use deployment records combined with self-reports of witnessing death to measure combat exposure, and we analyze the effect of various degrees of combat exposure on self-reported homelessness. We also investigate how the effects of combat exposure may vary over different time periods and among veterans with different pre-deployment characteristics. The focus on pre-deployment characteristics is important, since it provides information needed for proactive policy recommendations.====Investigation of the effect of combat exposure on veteran homelessness presents empirical challenges. The vast majority of veterans never experience homelessness, and data samples may not represent the underlying population. Additionally, estimations must consider all pre-deployment and deployment factors that can affect combat exposure or homelessness. As veterans who deploy overseas differ in observable and unobservable ways from similarly aged counterparts, both outside and within the military, comparisons with non-deployed populations are problematic (Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center, 2007).====We employ safeguards to estimate the effect of combat exposure on veteran homelessness. We use restricted panel data for the years 2001 through 2016 from the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) assessed across five time points spaced about three years apart. We focus on the sample of deployed veterans to ensure a valid comparison group. Our estimations account for individual pre-deployment military characteristics used by the military to determine deployment location assignments, and we leverage the military-induced variation in the deployment location assignments to address potential bias from non-random selection into a combat experience. We account for other pre-deployment individual and family characteristics as well as time spent deployed and physical harms in estimations. Additionally, we use an information theoretic, semi-parametric Generalized Maximum Entropy (GME) model. The approach reduces the sensitivity of the estimates to small and noisy real-world samples, infrequently observed outcomes, and highly correlated covariates.====We contribute to the broad literature on veteran health adjustments following traumatic events (see U.S. Institute of Medicine [IOM], 2013 for a review), and we contribute to a growing literature seeking to explain why veterans are homeless (Balshem et al., 2011; Fullerton and Ursano, 2009; Metraux et al., 2013; O'Connell et al., 2008; Perl, 2015; Tsai et al., 2016; Tsai and Rosenheck, 2015; Tsai et al., 2014; Tsai et al., 2013; Washington et al., 2010; see Tsai, 2018 for a review). The homelessness research suggests multiple factors, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance abuse disorders among others, increase a veteran's risk of homelessness. Though mental disorders are often linked to combat exposure, only one study detailed the rates of combat exposure in homeless all-volunteer force veterans (Tsai et al., 2013). This study indicates the majority of both male and female homeless veterans referred to a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) supportive housing program reported combat exposure and PTSD. However, the small, non-random sample lacking individual pre-deployment characteristics and a control group precludes causal inference.====We build upon previous research by being the first study to present estimates of the effect of combat exposure on homelessness in all-volunteer force veterans. Additionally, unlike previous studies of veteran homelessness using VA data (Metraux et al., 2013; Perl, 2015; Tsai et al., 2013), the current study includes veterans ineligible (due to active military status or an unfavorable military separation) to use VA services and veterans electing not to use VA services. The current study also conducts estimations showing the effect of combat exposure on both short and long homeless episodes. Our findings are robust to the inclusion of deployed time, disability or illness, and pre-deployment adverse experiences, including childhood neglect.====The findings reveal consistent detrimental effects of combat exposure on the probability of later experiencing homelessness. Our primary model indicates a single combat exposure increases the probability of homelessness by about 0.40 percentage points (27% relative to the mean probability) and multiple combat exposures increase the probability of homelessness by about 0.57 percentage points (38% relative to the mean probability). The weighted average effect of combat exposure, conditional on the share of single and multiple exposures observed in the sample, indicates an expected 0.50 percentage point increase in the probability of homelessness. Estimates also indicate veterans with poorer pre-deployment mental or physical health and veterans under the age of 30 years are less resilient to the effects of combat exposure on homelessness.

One’s home is not only a financial asset, but also a source of services that influences standards of living through various psychological and consumption benefits. Since those who do not own their accommodation have to pay rent to access similar services, and the fraction of home owners differs across countries and within countries across time, ignoring these differences might produce time-series and cross-sectional comparability problems. One way to solve these problems is to assign a monetary value to home ownership. This hypothetical income stream is known as imputed rent (IR).====The influence of IR has been explored in relation to income inequality and poverty (Garner, Short, 2009, Onrubia, Rodado, Ayala, 2009, Lerman, Lerman, 1986, Smeeding, Saunders, Coder, Jenkins, Fritzell, Hagenaars, Hauser, Wolfson, 1993, Yates, 1994, Buckley, Gurenko, 1997, Torrey, Smeeding, Bailey, 1999, Gasparini, Sosa Escudero, 2004, Saunders, Siminski, 2005, Frick, Grabka, Smeeding, Tsakloglou, 2010, Eurostat, Frick, Goebel, Grabka, 2014). The inclusion of IR into income measures tends to reduce poverty and income inequality indexes, as home ownership is usually more equally distributed than monetary income. The effect, however, has not been found to be strong enough to influence the countries’ inequality ranking.====Poverty and income inequality indexes are cross-sectional in nature. Another closely related statistic, that explicitly takes a longitudinal perspective and tracks over time the fortunes of the same family across generations, is known as intergenerational income mobility. In a practical sense, the intergenerational income mobility demonstrates how individuals’ economic well-being is determined by a factor that they never had a chance to influence: the economic well-being of their parents.====In its modern form, research in this area began in the mid-1980s with the work of Becker and Tomes (1986). Recently, due to the availability of high-quality datasets, astonishing progress has been made in this area, as exemplified by the work of Chetty et al. (2014), who analyzed 40 million children-parent pairs using 17 years of tax data in the United States. Cross-country comparison research shows that mobility is low in countries with high levels of inequality, such as Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States, and is much higher in Nordic countries that have more even levels of income distribution (Corak, 2013). The Great Gatsby Curve illustrates the connection between the concentration of income in one generation and the ability of those in the next generation to move further up the economic ladder (Krueger, 2012). We also know that intergenerational income persistence is greatest in the upper tail of income distributions; however, the United States stands out due to the particularly high likelihood that children of the poorest parents will remain the poorest members of society (Jantti et al., 2006). Further, research has shown that inclusive and universal education (Pekkarinen et al., 2009), and strong social security systems (Bratsberg et al., 2007), increase mobility.====There are few existing data sources which include IR and are appropriate for measuring intergenerational mobility. To my knowledge Cross National Equivalent File (CNEF) – database that harmonizes national household surveys – is the only source which has IR within an internationally comparable database; thereby providing a unique opportunity to explore the role of IR in intergenerational mobility. Germany and keeping in mind that they have different approaches of measuring IR – Using CNEF, this paper demonstrates that exclusion of IR might noticeably mute the intergenerational transmission of income for some countries and not others.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews the methods of calculating IR and intergenerational mobility; Section 3 introduces the data, and demonstrates descriptive statistics and how the beneficiaries of IR are distributed across countries and within countries by age groups and birth cohorts; Section 4 presents the results of the research; and Section 5 concludes and discuses the limitations of this study.",The role of imputed rents in intergenerational income mobility in three countries,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137720300462,3 July 2020,2020,Research Article,111.0

Existing theory reckons a linkage between the expected wait and the stochastic nature of development costs, but few empirical studies can address it due to data availability. This research merges developer characteristics with complete microdata on land acquisitions and developments of an emerging district in Taipei, and it adopts the Accelerated Failure Time model to examine the timing to build. The expected wait is longer for developers with more paid-in capital or with less development capacity. Most significantly, those involved in subsidiarization tend to shorten the wait. The results are robust under alternative specifications and consistent with the theoretical predictions of costs. Additionally, a policy incentive on the plot ratio substantially shortened the district's development process. The data have no censoring and truncation issues typically encountered in survival analysis. Further tests shed light on the severity of biases the estimation would suffer if the data had those issues.","Land scarcity concerns urban planning authorities in large, growing cities. Coupled with continuous urbanization, it could worsen housing affordability and constrain the provision of land-intensive amenities and infrastructures. The issue can be overwhelming in the East (e.g., Iwata and Oguchi, 2009; Kong, 2012), while it is also notable in the West (e.g., Alig et al., 2004; Asfour, 2012). To mitigate, Asian city governments often attempt using government land sales to influence land supply.====However, lands are real options. Developers often wait and do not pursue immediate development after acquisition (Titman, 1985), hindering a timely supply shift and causing problems of urban vacant land (Mayer and Somerville, 2000; Quigley and Raphael, 2005).==== Understanding the determinants of waiting can help the policy design of land supply, but empirical studies on the roles of developer characteristics are lacking. This paper researches developers’ perspectives on the timing to build, merging microdata of real-estate developers, land acquisitions, and project developments.====Land development is irreversible, and its payoff is uncertain. Thus, the possibility to keep the land vacant and wait for the optimal timing to build creates an option value, which is the maximum of the expected return. A large volume of theoretical research has established the real-option theory and extended it to incorporate various angles of urban development (Titman, 1985; McDonald and Siegel, 1986;Capozza and Helsley, 1990; Williams, 1991; Capozza and Li, 1994; Wang and Zhou, 2006; Dong and Sing, 2017). Particularly, McDonald and Siegel (1986) incorporate stochastic development costs as an important explaining factor.====Empirical research has confirmed that factors such as location, zoning, and competition can affect the option value, which significantly explains the price of the undeveloped land and the motivation to keep it vacant. (Quigg, 1993; Bulan et al., 2009; Guthrie, 2010; Grovenstein et al., 2011; Tsekrekos and Kanoutos, 2013; Yang and Wu, 2019). Importantly, Bulan et al. (2009) acknowledge the difficulty of obtaining development-cost data, which remains a significant gap in the empirical literature.====To fill this gap, we collect comprehensive information on the acquisitions and developments of all the land parcels in the National Taipei University District (NTPU-D), which was an urban redevelopment zone began in the 1990s and flourished in the 2000s, in Taiwan, as well as the characteristics of the developers holding these parcels. We apply an empirical survival model to estimate the hazard rate and make statistical inferences on how these developer characteristics relating to development costs affect the timing to build. The results are immune from the common censoring and truncation issues in survival analysis because the dataset consists of entire development processes of all lands.====Survival analysis is an appealing method to test the ====, which is the wait between the land acquisition and project launch because its results connect with the real-option theory well by the duality between the conditional probability and the first hitting-time of the development. The extant studies primarily concern macro-environmental factors. Cunningham (2006) shows that uncertainty delays development, while Bulan et al. (2009) find that competition negates this effect. Groves (2009) and Wrenn and Irwin (2015) evidence that property taxes and regulatory costs prolong the wait. Wang et al. (2016) suggest that in China, policy uncertainty is more impactful on the likelihood of land development than market uncertainty.====The left censoring and left truncation are the caveats concerning the validity of the existing results. Extant studies commonly assume the initial year of the sample period as the year of land acquisition because of data limitations, and Cunningham (2006) notes that this hypothetical beginning of exposure to development risk is problematic. The left censoring is the inclusion of land parcels with the unobservable actual onset of development risk before the sample period. An analysis that includes these parcels may also miss those lands that exposed to the risk during the same time but concluded with developments before the sample period. This second issue is the left truncation. Cain et al. (2011) show that both the left censoring and truncation can substantially bias the estimates and severely underestimate the standard errors, and remedial methods yield unstable results when the fraction truncated is high.====The complete NTPU-D data of developers and their developable lands are free of left censoring, left truncation, and right censoring and facilitate this research focusing on the waiting to build. The results from the Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) model suggest that developers with more paid-in capital or less development capacity tend to prolong the wait, but those who use a risk-shifting structure tend to shorten it, holding fixed important market conditions and land characteristics. The estimates have desired quality, suggested by a comparison with the counterfactual estimates obtained from a “pseudo sample” with the artificially created censoring and truncation, and by other robustness checks.====The findings regarding the heterogeneity of developers and uncertainty in project costs advance the real-option literature at the empirical front. Although there is an emerging interest to understand the roles of certain developer characteristics, the extant research is mainly theoretical (e.g., Wang and Zhou, 2000 &2006; Shen and Pretorius, 2013; Dong and Sing, 2017). Our empirical research plausibly builds on renowned theories of the real option, and the results provide useful implications and also lend support to some of the newer theoretical works.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents key background information on the NTPU-D study area and the workings of the land development and housing market. While the paper's contribution is not at the theoretical front, Section 3 lays out a conceptual modeling framework that can help readers to see the economics of the empirical findings in the context of the real option. Section 4 introduces the data work and draws reference from Section 3 to communicate the testable hypotheses and expected results.

However, the existence of landbanking (land hoarding), where land able to be profitably developed for housing is withheld from the market in anticipation of future gains, undermines the logic of such policy changes.====We expose major limits of the static housing supply model behind these policies by looking at the degree to which landbanking behaviour is consistent with model predictions. To do this, we assemble a new dataset of home sales and landbanks from the annual reports of Australia’s top eight publicly-listed residential developers from 2001 to 2018 and use complete state-level planning approvals and lot production data in Queensland, Australia.====In contrast to the static model prediction that landbanks serve the function of inventories, and are hence minimised, we find that (1) over 200,000 housing lots, or 13 years of new supply, are held by the eight largest housing development companies, and eight years of these landbanks are held in housing subdivisions that are approved and already for sale, that (2) the amount of zoned supply in a region is unrelated to the rate of new housing supply, and that (3) housing developers routinely delay housing production to capitalise on market cycles. Dynamic incentives to maximise total returns, including capital gains in the ==== of undeveloped land, could be related to this observed behaviour.","Economic analysis of rapid housing price growth often leads to the conclusion that planning regulations are to blame as they are thought to constrain the rate of new housing supply.==== This ‘planning constrains supply’ story has motivated policies aimed at reducing home prices by relaxing planning controls over the density, design and location of new housing. For example, Daley et al. (2017) argue that high home prices in New South Wales have arisen mainly “because of legislative restrictions on the effective supply of residential land – both limits on rezoning for urban infill and limits on developing land at the urban fringe.” The New South Wales government has adopted this view of planning policy noting that “[n]ew tools for rezoning will... unblock housing and employment supply” (NSW Government, 2013), while the Australian government established a National Housing Supply Council (NHSC) in 2008 to focus on “planning and development approval arrangements” to solve a “deficiency in supply [that] has contributed to rising house prices” (NHSC, 2013).====But such policies never seem able to stop rapid home price growth, even in cities and countries widely claimed to have supply-friendly planning regulations (Costello, Rowley, 2010, Gurran, Phibbs, 2013, Gomez-Gonzalez, Gamboa-Arbeláez, Hirs-Garzón, Pinchao-Rosero, 2018). For example, Houston, Texas, is widely known for its unrestrictive zoning and responsive supply yet home prices increased 49% from 2012 to 2018 (U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency, 2019). After the 2000s home price boom some prominent urban economists noted that “the fact that highly elastic places had price booms is one of the strange facts about the recent price explosion” (Glaeser et al., 2008).====We argue that these policy failures occur because they are based on static economic models of production that ignore important dynamic incentives governing the rate of new housing supply. This leaves few explanations for rapid price increases other than that ‘planning constrains supply’. In static models, new housing is produced from land and construction inputs if its price exceeds input costs, or ==== where ==== is the price of the land input and ==== is the total development cost. The equivalent condition in flow terms is ==== where ==== is the net housing rent and ==== is the interest rate. All potential homes where rents (or prices) satisfy this condition are produced instantly to ensure there are never inventories of profitable development sites. Subsequently, if prices (or rents) rise sufficiently for marginally unprofitable development locations to become profitable according to this supply condition, then these locations will also be immediately used for housing.====If the regulatory costs of new housing can be reduced, such as by lowering impact fees (reducing total costs of construction), or by relaxing density restrictions such as minimum lot sizes, or floor-area-ratio limits, that allow each dwelling to use less land (reducing land costs), additional profitable development options will be created and immediately taken up. Rezoning areas that were previously unavailable for housing also triggers immediate new supply by creating new locations that satisfy this supply condition. This is why planning controls are thought to be a powerful tool to combat rising home prices—they can create vast amounts of lower-cost housing supply because wherever they change this supply condition new housing will be immediately taken up to rapidly shift prices to a new lower equilibrium.====We provide evidence that this static model fails to represent the housing supply behaviour of private housing developers. Rather than build all profitable housing as soon as possible, housing developers hold a large inventory of land—their landbank. In a static model world, these landbanks should not exist at all, or at the very least be minimised. Housing developers should only purchase sites where development is legal and profitable (in expectation), building immediately.====Our empirical evidence breaks open the housing production process to see whether landbanks have the economic function of an inventory and are minimised as static models assume. We find none of the expected patterns of the static model in the data. Instead, we find that (1) over 200,000 housing lots, or 13 years supply, are held in landbanks owned by just the eight largest housing development companies and eight years worth of landbanks are in subdivisions that have been approved and are already for sale, meaning planning regulations or delays cannot be the reason these large landbanks are held, that (2) the amount of zoned ==== in a region is unrelated to the rate of new housing supply, and that (3) housing developers routinely delay housing production to capitalise on market cycles. These patterns are all inconsistent with the static housing production model and hint that timing housing production to match demand cycles is the main driver of production decisions.====While our objective is to disprove the value of the static model in understanding housing supply behaviour, we also offer ideas about how incorporating dynamic economic considerations, consistent with the real options and capital budgeting approaches to investment, can account for the high degree of observed landbanking. In a dynamic modelling approach, if the increase in the value of land is of equal significance in the profit function to income from converting land into housing, then the value change of the perpetual real option (but not obligation) to develop undeveloped land is cost of development that needs to be considered. Doing so substantially changes the hurdle condition for new housing supply compared to the static model.====We proceed by first reviewing the relevant literature and historical context for the dominance of the static modelling approach to housing supply, then review the data, methods, and theory that inform our analysis. We then present the results of our analysis, and discuss how a dynamic approach might be a fruitful direction in housing supply modelling, before concluding.",Time is money: How landbanking constrains housing supply,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137720300449,18 June 2020,2020,Research Article,113.0

However, existing empirical evidence is limited and exclusively focuses on few large cities in the U.S. This study examines the effects of Airbnb on housing rental and sales prices using a unique large-scale dataset comprised of housing market transaction records and the number of Airbnb listings drawn from their website in Taiwan. We estimate a fixed effect model of housing rental and sales price equations and find that a one-standard deviation increase in the number of Airbnb listings raises house rental prices by 0.38%. This finding suggests that a substitution effect is present between Airbnb's short-term accommodation and the housing rental market. Moreover, a larger effect on rental price is found among Airbnb listings that offer an entire room or apartment. Additionally, since September 2017, multinational digital platform companies must comply with a new sales tax policy in Taiwan. We evaluate the effect of this tax policy using the difference-in-difference method and find a negative impact on the number of Airbnb listings and housing rental prices after its implementation. This study is the first to empirically assess the effectiveness of tax policy on regulating room sharing business models.","With the rapid growth of the sharing economy, the interaction between room sharing business models and the housing market has recently received enormous attention. The operation of the sharing economy often involves a platform that facilitates relationships between buyers and sellers to arrange access to rent or purchase resources (e.g., ====; ====). The success of the business model relies on peer-to-peer accommodation networks on a platform that connects sellers and buyers (e.g., ====; ====). Airbnb is the most successful room sharing business model; it provides a platform to connect hosts and guests on opposite sides of the same platform. Airbnb hosts offer unused or underutilized space while Airbnb guests look for a place to stay. Given the popularity of Airbnb in many countries around the world, one particular question has been raised: does Airbnb impact the housing market? This study answers this question using a case study in Taiwan.====Scholars have recently proposed two different perspectives regarding the interaction between the room sharing economy and housing markets. On the one hand, room sharing business models may distort housing rents or sales prices through the reduction of housing supply in the market. After the entry of room sharing platforms, property owners can remove their property previously occupied by residential tenants from the housing rental market and reallocate them onto Airbnb for short-term accommodation. The reduction in the supply of rental properties in the housing market would then increase rental prices. Similarly, housing sales prices can rise if property owners decide to reallocate their properties from the housing sales market to Airbnb (====). On the other hand, Airbnb may not affect the current supply of the housing rental market if the majority of Airbnb listings are spare or unused rooms that are otherwise not available. Housing prices may be reduced if the short-term rentals through Airbnb bring in more tourists and result in adverse environmental problems, such as traffic and noise in quiet residential neighborhoods (====).====While room sharing platforms have garnered increasing attention worldwide, few empirical studies have been done on the impacts of Airbnb on housing markets. To the best of our knowledge, only a few studies could be found, and they were exclusively conducted in the U.S. ==== constructed a weekly region-specific housing rental dataset that consists of 113,409 rental items in the city of Boston between September 2015 and January 2016 and Airbnb listings drawn from their website. The authors found that the number of Airbnb listings had a positive impact on rents. Specifically, a one-standard deviation increase in Airbnb listings increased rents by 0.4%. ==== constructed a housing sales dataset from multiple sources and collected information on Airbnb from the InsideAirbnb website between January 2003 and August 2015 to investigate the impacts of Airbnb on house sales prices in New York City. The authors found a 6.46% increase in property values for a 100% increase in the total number of Airbnb accommodations. In contrast to ==== and ==== who only focus on one particular city in the U.S, ==== assessed the impacts of Airbnb on housing rental and sales prices across the entire U.S. Using an aggregate dataset at the county-month level, they found that a 10% increase in Airbnb listings led to a 0.42% and 0.75% increase in rents and housing prices, respectively. Moreover, the entry of Airbnb had a smaller effect on house rents in areas with a larger share of owner-occupiers.====This study examines the impacts of Airbnb on housing rental and sales prices in Taiwan. To do this, we use a large-scale sample of 55,581 and 550,951 transactions in the housing rental and sales market and web-scrapped data of Airbnb listings. We find a positive association between the number of Airbnb listings and housing rental prices by estimating the house rental and sales price equations using the fixed effect model. On average, a one-standard deviation increase in the number of Airbnb listings significantly increases housing rental prices by 0.38%. Furthermore, the positive effect of Airbnb on rental prices is more substantial for listings that offer an entire house. This finding provides evidence of a substitution between Airbnb's short-term accommodation and the housing rental market, but not with the housing sales market.====). However, no study thus far has empirically addressed this issue. In this study, we leverage the fact that multinational platform companies were suddenly forced to comply with the sales tax regulations along with other domestic enterprises that operate businesses in Taiwan since September 2017. This policy amendment on Airbnb provides an opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of tax policies on room sharing platforms. We apply the difference-in-difference model and find that the sales tax policy reduced the number of Airbnb listings and the effect of Airbnb on housing rental prices.====This study contributes to the burgeoning literature on the relationship between Airbnb and housing markets on several fronts. First, very little research on the impacts of Airbnb on housing markets has been done. The few available studies were exclusively conducted in the US. This paper contributes to this knowledge gap by providing a case study in Taiwan. Second, in contrast to most existing studies that use an aggregate dataset at the county level (e.g., ====) or individual house transaction records in a specific city (e.g., ==== for New York City), this paper uses a large-scale administrative housing transaction dataset in Taiwan. Using the administrative housing market rental and sales profile of each property provides an objective measure of rental and sales prices that avoids measurement errors. Furthermore, using a large dataset of all areas in Taiwan allows us to examine the heterogeneous effects of Airbnb on the housing market based on urban-rural differences and the types of Airbnb listings. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, this paper is among the first to provide an empirical assessment of some of the policy instruments designed to regulate Airbnb, such as sales taxes.",Does the room sharing business model disrupt housing markets?

In order to better capture the local housing market dynamics, we use data not only on house prices but also on transaction volumes. In particular, we focus on estimating, to what extent, exogenous shocks, interpreted as negative housing demand shocks, arising from 10 Italian regional capitals, impact on their house prices and sales and how these shocks spill over to neighbours housing markets. The negative housing market demand shock hitting the GVAR model is identified by using theory-driven sign restrictions. The spatio-temporal analysis carried through impulse response functions shows that there is evidence of a “ripple effect” mainly occurring through transaction volumes.","This paper investigates the spatial and temporal diffusion of house prices and transaction volumes across 93 Italian provincial housing markets, over the period ====.====The transmission mechanism of house price spillovers across space and time is known in literature as “ripple effect”. [32] gives four different explanations of the “ripple effect” in the UK housing markets – migration, equity transfer, spatial arbitrage and exogenous shocks. In particular, migration or equity transfer (e.g. longer-term residents of one area accumulate significant wealth in their home equity, cash out that equity by selling their home and moving to a lower cost region where a similar quality house costs much less) could lead to the ripple effect by increasing demand and thereby prices. Moreover, investors could spatially arbitrage their funds to acquire properties in lower priced regions, where higher anticipated returns exist on housing investment. In this case, financial capital moves, rather than households, between regions to link house prices. Finally, ripple effect pattern can be ascribed to heterogeneous responses of each region to exogenous macro conditions.====Empirical evidence of house prices spillovers across regions has been provided for UK [see [24], [23], [39], [33], among the others], for US [4], [5], for China [22] or for Denmark [26]. Most of these studies control for long run convergence in house prices by taking into account error correcting dynamics to long-run equilibrium relationship between house prices. The long-run analysis is particularly suitable to explore the role played by observed fundamentals (income and interest rates) in shaping the house prices long-run dynamics. However, given the short time data span, our analysis does not control for long-run equilibrium and error correcting dynamics.====Our first contribution to the existing studies on ripple effect using only house prices is based on an extension of the information set to transaction volumes in order to better capture the local housing market dynamics and the associated spillovers effect across space and time.====Second, our analysis allows to assess heterogeneity in the spatial-temporal diffusion. While most of the studies on “ripple effect” focus on spillovers from a main regional capital, in this paper we analyze how a specific shock to the house prices and transaction volumes arising from 10 Italian regional capitals spills over to other urban areas (their neighbours). In particular, we compute a spillover index through impulse responses obtained from the estimation of a Global Vector Autoregression, GVAR, model. The index, which is obtained by the ratio of the neighbours to the main regional capital’s response (over different forecast horizons) to a one standard deviation shock occurring to the main regional capitals, can help the interpretation of the empirical findings on the “ripple effect”.====Finally, we contribute to the literature on the house price-volume correlation, which is based on the evaluation of the dynamic effects of observable housing market fundamentals on the price-volume co-movements [see [1], [11], among the others]. In particular, we analyze the spatio-temporal diffusion of house prices and volumes driven by unobserved fundamentals. The latent variable is interpreted as a negative housing demand shock identified through sign restrictions on house prices and transaction volumes modelled through a Global VAR, GVAR. The structural form impulse response analysis is informative on how local adverse shocks to fundamentals (which could be interpreted as a combination of negative income shock and a rise to interest rates) impact on house price and volumes of the other areas (neighbours).====The GVAR model used for the empirical analysis, introduced by [35], is a multi-country extension of the standard VAR model which allows to examine the temporal transmission of shocks within and between different geographical areas. The model allows to control for weak cross sectional dependence by using a spatial exogenous regressor. Consequently, we model the influence of a common factor diminishing its influence by increasing the distance. The structural housing demand shock is identified through theory-driven sign restrictions following the approach recently proposed in the study of [17], which focuses on the transmission of US credit supply shocks across a panel of 33 countries over the period ====.====Recently, a number of studies have used a Global VAR, GVAR, to examine the role played by housing demand shocks in driving the international transmission of house price across countries. [42] analyze the house price spillover mechanism across 7 Euro area countries, over the ====time span. The empirical model used is a Global VAR, GVAR, fitted to real house prices, real per capita income, and real long-term interest rate. [42] find evidence of heterogeneity in the relatively small country house price responses to demand shocks. [7] examines the international transmission of housing demand shocks using data on 33 Advanced Economies (AEs) and Emerging Market Economies (EMEs), for the period ====. The author uses a GVAR model to evaluate to what extent a housing demand shock in US impact on a set of macroeconomic and financial variables, including GDP and house price. In a second stage of the analysis, the authors estimates the GDP response to regional housing demand shocks (a synchronized increase in house prices in AEs). Although the main focus of the paper is on the response of the GDP across countries, [7]finds that an increase in house prices also affects foreign housing markets.====In this paper, we use semi-annual observations on real house prices and transaction volumes for 93 Italian provinces, over the period ====. More specifically, we use a confidential and unique dataset provided by the Real Estate Market Observatory managed by the Italian Revenue Agency (“Agenzia delle Entrate - Osservatorio del Mercato Immobiliare”) for the house prices. This rich dataset contains information at semi-annual frequency on maximum and minimum house prices (nominal, in euro) categorized by types of real estate (housing, appurtenances, office, retail and industrial) and areas (i.e. central, suburbs, hinterlands), at municipal level, over the period from second semester 2002 to second semester 2016. As for the transaction volumes, we use quarterly observations for the number of normalized transaction (NNT), collected from the publicly available database of the Real Estate Market Observatory - Italian Revenue Agency (“Agenzia delle Entrate - Osservatorio del Mercato Immobiliare”), covering the 2004====1 - 2016====4 time span. To match the semi-annual data frequency of house prices, we aggregate the quarterly data on volumes, by taking the sum over two consecutive quarters.====Our analysis provides some interesting findings. First, contrary to a large body of literature, this study does not find evidence of a “ripple effect” in house prices, with the notably exception of Rome. Second, we find evidence of a “ripple effect” in transaction volumes. In particular, the empirical results show that transaction volumes largely spill over across regional capitals and neighbours in response to the negative housing demand shock.====This paper is structured as follows.

The authorities have used them to address externalities associated with two main dimensions of systemic risk: time-series and structural (Claessens 2014; Galati and Moessner 2018). In the ====, collateralized borrowing generates externalities and facilitates the emergence of boom-bust cycles. Fire sales represent a vivid example: simultaneous deleveraging in bad times by individual borrowers who do not take into account how their behavior collectively affects the entire system may lead to swings in asset prices and credit. In the ====, externalities arise from the financial market structure, such as interconnectedness and size. Systemic risks may arise if financial institutions, especially systemically important ones, do not internalize the impact of their exposures on other financial institutions and the rest of the economy.====While containing the systemic financial risk is the ultimate objective of macroprudential policies, in practice policymakers pursue intermediate targets—such as house prices and credit (BIS 2018).==== Despite the widespread use of macroprudential instruments in recent years, understanding of their effectiveness is limited. First, these policies have become popular following the crisis and relatively few measures were implemented in individual countries so far. Expanding the analysis to a cross-country sample helps increasing the number of observations but requires exercising care when drawing inferences for individual countries. Second, macroprudential policies rely on multiple instruments to tackle multiple intermediate targets. This differentiates macroprudential policies from monetary and fiscal policies, where the number of instruments and targets is smaller. Measuring effectiveness of macroprudential policies is thus more complicated since assessment should be made for a multiple combination of instruments and targets.====Several recent papers have provided cross-country empirical evidence on the effectiveness of macroprudential policies. The results are mixed. One reason is that the samples typically include a large number of heterogeneous countries (EU and non-EU) to expand the number of observations and this can dilute the results. In addition, most studies focus on the short-term—usually one period ahead—effects of macroprudential policies, while in many cases the full impact of the measures takes time to materialize. It is also notable that macroprudential stance is typically measured using indices of macroprudential measures, while policymakers are typically interested in the effects of discretionary tightening and loosening actions. Finally, none of the studies explores whether the effectiveness of macroprudential measures varies across types (e.g., legally-binding measures versus recommendations, measures with and without sanctions).====Despite the limitations of the cross-country approach mentioned above, it has been used widely in the past to complement evidence from country-specific studies based on micro-level data. The purpose of this paper is to fill some of the gaps plaguing the cross-country approach and evaluate the effectiveness of macroprudential policies in 28 EU countries over the period 1990–2018. The main novelty is that we analyze the role of discretionary macroprudential measures (tightening and loosening) collected from officials using a survey. Also, unlike most studies, we analyze the causal effect from macroprudential measures to house prices and credit. We focus on lending restriction measures, such as loan-to-value (LTV) and debt-service-to-income (DSTI) ratios, and assess their dynamic association with house prices and credit for up to 16 quarters. We also check whether the impact varies across different types of measures and country groups. The results suggest that lending restrictions have a significant association with house prices and credit, peaking at -1.5 percent after three years. However, there is asymmetry between tightening and loosening measures, with the former being weaker. There are also notable differences of effectiveness across country groups and types of measures. The results should be interpreted with caution given reverse causality between discretionary macroprudential actions and developments in target variables. Further analysis suggests that the association is stronger (-3 percent) when reverse causality is controlled for.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section II reviews cross-country empirical literature on the effectiveness of macroprudential policy. Section III discusses the dataset and describes the stylized facts. Section IV presents the estimation methodology and discusses results. The final section concludes.",How effective is macroprudential policy?

Leamer (2007, 2015) claimed that housing activities predict and cause national business cycles in the United States. We investigate his claims for a larger set of countries. We also examine this predictive relationship in multiple resolutions or timescales, namely, short-run and long-run variations of business cycles. Structural vector auto-regression (SVAR) models are estimated to test his more contentious causal claim. Our results show that housing indicators lead business cycles in most countries and that leading relationship is more prominent in the long run. In addition, our SVAR results for the United States indicate that housing factors are likely independent drivers of business cycles. Housing supply indicators predict short-run variations in business cycles, and housing price predicts long-run variations better. The cross-country evidence is less certain. Generally, our findings on timescale-based relationships between housing and the macro economy restrict future models of business cycles.","Business activities in the housing market, such as building permits and housing starts, have long been recognized as leading indicators of aggregate economy (Green, 1997; Coulson and Kim, 2000) and are regularly mentioned in news media in comments on macroeconomic conditions. Leamer (2007, 2015) offers a much more provocative proposition that “Housing Is the Business Cycle” in the United States. He suggests that the relationship between fluctuations in housing markets and business cycles are both predictive and causal. We investigate both his claims in this paper.====The role the housing sector plays in the propagation of business cycles is the basis of these two claims. Most business cycle models do not offer concrete insights on this question because the housing sector is rarely incorporated in these models. Before the recent global financial crisis, Davis and Heathcote (2005) and Iacoviello (2005) are the exceptions.==== After the crisis, many papers that include housing sector have been written, for example, Iacoviello and Neri (2010); Liu, Wang, and Zha (2013); Liu, Miao, and Zha (2016); and Kydland, Rupert, and Sustek (2016). However, these authors disagree on whether housing factors are autonomous or are merely a part of monetary transmission mechanisms.====In this paper, we characterize the relationship between housing and macroeconomic variables in multiple time scales. Our approach is closely related to the literature that considers business cycles the sum of fluctuations in different time scales. Since as early as Schumpeter (1939), economists have proposed the distinction among the minor cycle (or Kitchin cycle), major cycle (or Juglar cycle), and long wave (or Kondratieff wave) in economic development. Moreover, cycles of different frequencies are linked to specific mechanisms. For example, Kitchin cycles (2–4 years) are associated with fluctuations in the employment of fixed capital and inventory. Juglar cycles (7–11 years) are due to oscillations in investments in fixed capital. Kuznets cycles (15–25 years) are caused by changes in demographics and infrastructure investments. Schumpeter cycles or Kondratieff long waves (54–60 years) are due to basic and revolutionary technological changes. This multiresolution view of business cycles went out of fashion recently. By revisiting this traditional perspective, we establish new empirical regularities and investigate possible mechanisms behind the housing macroeconomy link.====Specifically, we restrict our analysis to cyclical variations from 6 quarters to 32 quarters to be consistent with the recent literature on business cycles. Time scales are differentiated by wavelet multiresolution analysis. Intuitively, wavelet analysis decomposes the original time series into its trend component and many time scales, representing an increasing number of details related to the original data. We focus on two time scales, namely, 8–16 quarters and 16–32 quarters: The former describes short-run variations within business cycles, and the latter characterizes long-run movements. Because cycles of different lengths are exposed to distinct factors, the strength or the direction of the predictive relationship can vary by timescales.====According to our review of the literature, no macroeconomics models of housing markets that generate explicit timescale-based predictions have been created. On an intuitive level, time horizons matter for the real estate industry, in which decision-makers engage in both short-term decisions and long-term planning. For example, developers are concerned with their immediate sales and profits, upcoming new supplies of their own and of their competitors, and their inventory of developable land, which are closely related to the credit environment largely determined by commercial banks and ultimately the central bank. When setting an interest rate and the money supply, central banks also balance their short-term goals of supplying liquidity with long-term objectives of ensuring sustained economic stability. Future macroeconomic models will be more credible if they match these fine empirical features differentiated by time scales. In other words, the empirical patterns in this paper restrict the models of the housing sector in an economy.====In addition, we describe the relationship between housing and macroeconomic variables for a larger set of countries, namely, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. Expanding the analysis to multiple countries tests the robustness of Leamer (2007, 2015)’s claims and provides a means to discover the underlying mechanism. Institutional variations across countries, for example, the share of residential investment in gross domestic product (GDP), development of housing finance system, and industrial organization of real estate industry, naturally affect the presumed relationship. A cross-country study that exploits such variations provides information on the importance of various transmission mechanisms. For example, studies have used institutional details in mortgage markets to explain intercountry differences in the housing–economy link, for example, Rubio (2011); Calza, Monacelli, and Stracca (2013); and Garriga, Kydland, and Sustek (2017).====Moreover, we investigate more indicators. Specifically, we include building permits, housing starts, housing price index, and residential investment as housing-related indicators. In terms of the macroeconomy, we include GDP, an industrial production index, and unemployment rate. Inclusion of alternative measures tests the robustness of our results and explores the relationship based on its timescales. Housing indicators usually occur sequentially. Residential investment requires time to materialize and to be recorded by statistical agencies. Consequently, building permits and housing starts precede residential investment. The sequential relationship helps reveal deeper mechanisms regarding why some housing indicators lead the macroeconomy. Kydland, Rupert, and Sustek (2016) offer a similar insight, but our study offers a larger set of variables and countries as well as a multiresolution perspective.====In the first part of our paper, we investigate the predictive relationship between housing indicators and business activities. We find the following results. First, the contemporaneous correlations between housing indicators and business activities strengthen as time scales increase. Such a result is robust to alternative measures of housing and economic variables. Second, housing indicators lead business activities in a majority of OECD countries. Moreover, this leading relationship is more prominent in long-term business cycles. Last, building permits and housing starts predict business activities more strongly than other indicators, such as residential investment and housing price, and timing of housing indicators matter.====In the second part of our paper, we investigate the controversial causal claim of Leamer (2007, 2015). Causality is difficult to establish in empirical macroeconomics (Nakamura and Steinsson, 2017). The main counterargument to Leamer (2007, 2015) is from Smets (2007) and Kydland, Rupert, and Sustek (2016), who have claimed that housing demand and supply are unlikely the impetus of business cycles because they are determined by changes in nominal interest rate as a part of the monetary transmission mechanism. We contribute to this debate by employing structural vector auto-regressions (SVARs). We adopt a simple recursive identification scheme justified by the theoretical mechanisms in Mishkin (2007).==== These SVARs arguably separate shocks in monetary policy from those in the housing sector. Thus. we can determine more reliably the role played by the housing sector in economic fluctuations.====Studies using SVARs to describe how housing sector interacts with the economy, for example, Goodhart and Hofmann (2008); Ghent and Owyang (2010); Musso, Neri, and Stracca (2011); and Cesa-Bianchi (2013), have usually selected a recursive identification scheme without referring to a particular economic mechanism. By contrast, we distinguish among alternative channels by selecting four sets of endogenous variables and their respective recursive structures. In our paper, user cost of homeownership represents the crucial link between monetary and housing variables, differing from the literature that has mostly omitted it in their SVAR specifications. Additionally, we differentiate between long-run and short-run variations within business cycles, offering a multiresolution SVAR analysis.====The results on SVARs resonate with our findings in the first part. For the United States (US), housing factors are likely autonomous drivers of business cycles. In other words, the housing market is not a mere channel through which monetary shocks propagate. More notably, housing supply indicators such as housing starts or building permits predict business activities in both timescales, but housing price predicts long-term variations better. However, evidence for other countries has been less conclusive. Overall, a comparison of the predictive ability of interest rate versus housing factors demonstrates an independent role of housing shocks in business cycles. Additionally, housing price has been observed to predict business activities in the long run in many countries.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data, the wavelet multiresolution analysis, and the SVAR methodology. Section 3 shows the empirical results for the lead–lag relationships between the housing and macroeconomic variables.

Using individual data from the collection of real estate transactions data for Berlin, Germany, we find a positive price gap for houses in Berlin in 1990 which is decreasing up to 1998. When controlling for structural characteristics, no positive price gap can be identified between 1996 and 2006. The application of Oaxaca decomposition reveals a growing preference for size (favoring houses), which is – since 2006 - offset by a growing preference for a more central location.","Relative price developments of apartments and single family houses may be due to macroeconomic as well as meso/microeconomic reasons. For simplicity single family houses will be called houses from now on. In a nation-wide macroeconomic analysis of the US market, Chinloy et al. (2014) argue that apartments and houses are substitutes in demand (consumption) and in supply (production). They find that construction volumes of houses and apartments exhibit different fluctuations, especially due to the variation of interest rates, with the construction of houses being more interest-rate elastic. In the US, houses are mostly owner occupied, but there is an equity market for apartments. As a result, the relative prices of apartments are increasing in times of decreasing interest rates.====On a microlevel, changing preferences in forms of living may be relevant (e.g., a growing preference for living in centrally located apartments rather than in houses). Chen and Harding (2016) find a growing preference for living space between 1985 and 2011 for the area of Chicago. Such changing preferences may be due to changes in lifestyles, such as those related to “urbanization” (Bögel et al., 2014), but may also be due to changes in demographics (Bogin et al., 2018). The growth of single-person households may affect the structure of demand for housing (Dieleman & Schouw, 1989). In many western cities, more than 50 percent of dwellings are occupied by single households (Eurostat, 2015).====We contribute to the analysis of the price gap by using the collection of real estate transactions (“Kaufpreissammlung”) for Berlin, Germany, as well as by estimating the relative price developments of houses and apartments by controlling for the usual determinants of real estate prices. The analysis of the differences of submarkets in the housing sector and the analysis of the valuation of buildings of different types over time are well-established fields of real estate economics (Watkins, 1999; Keskin & Watkins, 2016; Dermisi & McDonald, 2010). However, to our knowledge, there has been no decomposition of price differences into their microeconomic determinants, which could disclose potential dynamics in preferences. We add to a study by Chinloy et al. (2014) by analyzing individual transaction data and by controlling for spatial determinants as well as object characteristics rather than aggregated macro data.====We also offer a regional diversion to the literature on price gaps by analyzing the real estate market in Berlin, Germany. Our research relates to the literature on the urban economics of Berlin following reunification occurring in 1990 that uses a well-established set of data, determinants and model structures (Ahlfeldt & Maennig, 2010a, 2010b, 2010c, 2013; Beimer & Maennig, 2017), evaluates the impact of policy interventions (Alberts, 2009; Ahlfeldt et al., 2017), and controls for the impact of local interest groups (Molnar, 2010; Ahlfeldt, 2011; Marquardt et al., 2013; Ahlfeldt & Maennig, 2015) and for external shocks such as tourism (Schafer & Hirsch, 2017). Our study also relates to Thomschke (2015), who decomposes the rent price boom, applies spatial explanatory variables such as amenities and socioeconomic structures, and differentiates between the specific impacts of each variable. Following Sah et al. (2016) we make sure to use robust hedonic controls. Comparing different spatial controls assures robust results.====As a second step we provide a better understanding of the dynamics and most relevant driving forces of the price gap between houses and apartments by using Oaxaca-Binder decomposition (OD). OD was developed to decompose the gender wage gap (Blinder, 1973; Oaxaca, 1973) and has led to the identification of a gap of approximately 30% that can be attributed in large part to different characteristics of the two gender groups. Since its first use, OD has been used to analyze the income gap between black and white populations (Melly, 2005; Moral-Arce et al., 2012; Ospino et al., 2010), variations in the FDI indices of countries (Wei, 2005), smoking behavior (Bauer et al., 2007), infant mortality rates (Demombynes & Trommlerová, 2016), birthweights (Lhila & Long, 2012) and hunting lease rates (Munn & Hussain, 2010). In housing economics and real estate economics, Coulson and Dalton (2010); Newman et al. (2018), and Zorlu et al. (2014) use OD in order to identify potential effects of ethnicity on household formation and home ownership. LeSage & Charles (2008) use OD to explain the gap between newer and older houses, but do not consider amenities or socioeconomics variables. Another difference from our study relates to the time horizon used; their study is cross-sectional and does not analyze potential dynamics of preferences. Most recently Zhang & Yi (2018) using OD have shown for Beijing that price increases of housing units between 2012 and 2015 can mostly be attributed to changes in preferences in contrast to changes in the housing characteristics. Mathä et al. (2017) use OD and find that homeownership and house price dynamics have a strong effect on the net wealth of a person.",On the price gap between single family houses and apartments,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137720300231,7 May 2020,2020,Research Article,118.0

We study real estate markets and find that households’ subjective house-price expectations capture momentum but not reversion to fundamentals. Moreover, if house prices are currently deviated upwards (downwards) from their long-run relationship with economic fundamentals, households will have even higher (lower) expectations of future appreciations. Additional empirical results suggest that the more likely reason is that households do not have accurate perception of the fundamental value (fundamental-misperception conjecture) than that they do not believe that mispricing will be quickly corrected by the market (mispricing-persistence conjecture).","Empirical asset-price movements exhibit momentum and reversion to fundamentals, which are well documented in the literature (e.g. Capozza et al. (2004), Abraham and Hendershott (1996), Malpezzi (1999), and Gao et al. (2009) on real estate prices; Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) on stock momentum and Fama and French (1992) and Lakonishok et al. (1994) on stock fundamental reversion; and Taylor (2002) and Corbae and Ouliaris (1988) on foreign currency exchange rates). Momentum refers that what was strongly increasing in the past will probably continue to increase in the near future. Reversion to fundamentals refers that when asset prices have deviated from the long-run relationship with the fundamentals, there is a force driving those asset prices back to the long-run equilibrium level according to the fundamentals.====To explain the phenomena of momentum and reversion to fundamentals in empirical asset-price movements, models with behavioral expectation bias are introduced in the literature (e.g. Glaeser and Nathanson (2017), Guren (2018), and Burnside et al. (2016) on real estate prices; and Barberis et al. (1998), Daniel et al. (1998), and Hong and Stein (1999) on stock prices). The simulation of those models can well match the realized asset price data.====Different from the empirical literature documenting momentum and reversion to fundamentals of actual asset prices and the theoretical literature providing explanations, in this paper, using survey data on households’ subjective expectations, we analyze whether households’ subjective expectations of house-price appreciation rates capture the momentum and reversion-to-fundamentals effects that are observed in actual house-price data. The house-price subjective expectation data are from the Michigan Survey of Consumers covering 2007-2014 and the Case-Shiller survey covering 2003-2012. The results indicate that households do capture the momentum effect when forming their expectations, i.e., if recent house-price appreciation rates are high (low), households tend to expect high (low) appreciation rates in the near future. However, households do not capture the reversion-to-fundamentals effect when forming their expectations. Moreover, if current house prices are deviated upwards (downwards) from the long-run relationship with economic fundamentals, households tend to have an even higher (lower) expectation of the house-price appreciation rate in the future, although actual house-price data exhibit reversion to the long-run relationship with economic fundamentals.====There are two possible reasons for the failure of subjective expectations to capture reversion to fundamentals. One possibility is referred to as the fundamental-misperception conjecture. Households’ expectation pattern is that the expected house prices tend to move toward a reasonable or rational value in their minds. However, households’ perceived rational value may not be the same as the actual rational value in line with the economic fundamentals. Households may tend to optimistically overestimate the rational value during boom times and tend to pessimistically underestimate the rational value during times of recession.====The other possibility is referred to as the mispricing-persistence conjecture. Households may have an accurate perception of the actual rational value in line with the economic fundamentals and know whether houses are mispriced, but they do not believe that mispricing will be corrected by the market in the short run. They have a belief that in the market, there exist a number of irrational traders and, consequently, speculative opportunities of further capital gains (losses) even when assets are currently overpriced (underpriced).====The empirical results in this paper indicate that the first possibility is more likely. We analyze another survey data that ask respondents not only about their expectations on future house-price appreciations but also whether they think the current house price is just right, too high, or too low as compared to the fair value. The empirical results show that respondents tend to have a lower (higher) expectation on future house-price appreciations if they think the current house prices are too high (low) as compared to the fair value.====Due to the lower availability of subjective house-price expectation data compared to realized house-price data, majority of previous studies on house-price expectation formation did not examine the subjective expectation data. Instead, they calibrated and simulated models with certain assumptions about expectation formation to see whether the simulated data could match the realized house-price data. A few studies analyzed the formation of house-price expectations directly using subjective expectation data, and they focused on other aspects. Using survey data covering four counties, Case et al. (2012) regressed the expected house-price changes on the past actual house-price changes and documented the momentum effect on subjective expectations. Piazzesi and Schneider (2009) used the Michigan Survey data to study households’ opinions on whether it was a good time to buy houses during boom. Niu and van Soest (2014) studied house-price expectations using the American Life Panel data. Using the Wall Street Journal's economic forecasting survey, Zhang (2016) analyzed the unbiasedness and efficiency of house-price expectations by professional forecasters. Using the Survey of Consumer Expectations by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Kuchler and Zafar (2019) studied the effect of past momentum on house-price expectations and the effect of past volatility on the width of the distribution of house-price expectations.==== Howard and Karagedikli (2012) studied the subjective house-price expectations of households in New Zealand. Armona et al. (2019) conducted an experiment to infer mean-reversion perception based on how subjects revise their expectations after hearing the true house prices.====The difference between mean reversion in DeBondt and Thaler (1985) and Armona et al. (2019) and fundamental reversion in Fama and French (1992), Lakonishok et al. (1994), and our study is that mean reversion is reversion to an unconditional mean, whereas reversion to fundamentals is reversion to a conditional mean, as the long-run equilibrium level of house prices according to current economic fundamentals is a conditional mean that varies according to current fundamental conditions. For example, if house prices drop after growing for a long period, it is mean reversion; however, it is not fundamental reversion if fundamental economic conditions also dramatically drop, because the gap between prices and fundamental values does not become narrower. In addition, our study provides empirical evidence regarding the fundamental-misperception conjecture and the mispricing-persistence conjecture to explain the divergence of expectations from fundamentals.====This paper also contributes to the general literature that reject the rational expectations hypothesis using survey data on subjective expectations, such as Greenwood and Shleifer (2014) on general irrational stock-return expectations; Malmendier and Nagel (2016) on the effect of lifetime experience; Carroll (2003) on the effect of news reports; Branch (2007), Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2015), and Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2012) on the effect of information rigidities; Branch (2004) on households’ tradeoff between the accuracy and the cost of complexity of forecasting methods; Ehrbeck and Waldmann (1996) on the strategic interactions of professional forecasters; Coibion et al. (2018b) on expectations formed by firms; and Rich and Tracy (2010) and Engelberg et al. (2009) on forecast uncertainty. Some studies also provided evidence that individuals’ expectations are inconsistent with either existing economic theories or realized economic data. For example, using the Michigan Survey data, Dräger et al. (2016) found that only 34% of households had a Phillips curve tradeoff in mind when forming expectations on inflation and unemployment, and only 46% of households formed expectations regarding the interest rate, inflation, and unemployment rate in line with a Taylor rule relationship. Carvalho and Nechio (2014) conducted a similar study.====This paper employs some unique features of housing markets compared to other asset markets to answer a general research question of whether subjective expectations on asset prices capture reversion to fundamentals. First, the surveys used in this paper asked about subjective expectations on local-market real-estate prices; as hot markets, cold markets, and stable markets can exist at the same time in different locations, the variations in deviations from fundamentals are not only over-time but also cross-sectional. In contrast, for stock prices, most surveys asked about subjective expectations only on overall stock market performance rather than individual-stock performance (see Greenwood and Shleifer (2014)); thus, the variations in deviations from fundamentals are only over-time and not cross-sectional.==== Second, although some surveys ask respondents about their subjective expectations on individual stocks, it is still difficult to use realized stock prices to construct a proxy for the long-run equilibrium level of an individual stock to which the individual stock price converges in a long-run perspective, because individual stock prices are highly noisy and fluctuate at a high frequency.==== In the empirical asset pricing literature (e.g., Fama and MacBeth (1973), Fama and French (1992, 1993, and 1996), and Lakonishok et al. (1994)) in which the dependent variable is realized stock returns, to reduce the noise, individual stocks were usually grouped into 20 to 30 portfolios and the regressions were conducted at the portfolio level. However, it is difficult to ask ordinary survey respondents to form expectations on the returns of Fama-Macbeth or Fama-French portfolios, although it may be easy for them to form expectations on an individual stock such as Microsoft or Facebook.==== In contrast, house prices do not fluctuate at a high frequency; and with error correction models, the literature have well documented that house prices in a city tend to converge to a long-run equilibrium relationship with local fundamental economic conditions in the long run.====This paper also contributes to the literature on cognitive abilities and irrational behaviors in real estate markets, such as Cheng et al. (2014) on Wall-Street managers’ awareness of the 2007 housing crisis in 2004-2006, Pope et al. (2015) on the focal-point effect on bargaining in housing markets, Keys et al. (2016) on irrational behaviors in mortgage refinance decisions, Agarwal et al. (2017) on mistakes in mortgage contract selections, and Agarwal and Mazumder (2013) on mistakes in home equity loan or line of credit (HELOC) applications.====The remaining portion of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the data used in this paper. In Section 3, the empirical models are explained.

In a benchmark ==== of housing markets, housing price-to-rent ratios are counterfactual if the transmission channel from housing to the current account is only through the consumption effects from relaxed borrowing constraints. Utilizing a model with enough reallocation of labor between construction and tradable goods resolves the problem. In this model, using survey data on housing price expectations generates dynamics of housing variables and the current account consistent with the data. However, ==== dynamics are counterfactual.","The Great Recession has triggered an active literature studying the macroeconomic effects of housing markets.==== This paper studies two related questions that remain unresolved: what are the causes behind the boom and bust of housing markets over the past two decades? What are the transmission channels from housing to the aggregate economy? First, I demonstrate that over the past two decades housing dynamics are negatively correlated with current account dynamics, both across and within countries. These correlations are so strong that narratives of housing booms and busts should also be consistent with the current account. I argue that the way the literature has studied the transmission channel from housing markets to the current account is incomplete as it generates counterfactual price-to-rent ratios. I propose a model that avoids this problem because it has a new mechanism coming from labor reallocation between tradable goods and construction. Moreover, the model gives a key role to changes in housing price expectations. Finally, I use the model to evaluate the role of housing expectations as a driver of housing and current account dynamics. In these past years a ”new narrative of the crisis” has emerged that points toward changes in housing prices expectations, more than an expansion in credit supply, as the main driver of the housing boom.====Gete (2009), Bernanke (2010) and Aizenman and Jinjarak (2014) documented the strong link between housing variables and current account dynamics in the pre-crisis period. Section 2 in this paper shows that the strong correlation was also present during the Great Recession. For example, pre-Great Recession, countries like Spain or the U.S., among others, had large housing booms and current account deficits. Current account reversals coincided with the decline in housing markets. Meanwhile, in countries like Canada, Germany or Switzerland, residential investment and housing prices decreased before 2007 in the midst of large current account surpluses. These surpluses moved towards deficits as housing dynamics improved in the Great Recession period.====The standard way in the literature to connect housing and the current account builds on the seminal work of Iacoviello (2005). Open economy versions of that model generate the negative correlation between housing prices and the current account through the consumption reaction of the borrowing constrained households (see for example Punzi, 2013 or Ferrero, 2015. That is, higher housing prices relax borrowing constraints and the higher consumption of the impatient households leads to a current account deficit. Section 5 in this paper shows that relying only on that mechanism generates counterfactual housing price-to-rent ratios. This results from the impatient agents that value the present flow of housing (rental rates) more than the stock (housing prices). That is, the impatient agents, once they own a sufficient quantity of housing, desire present consumption and do not value the durable goods (houses).====Enough reallocation of labor between construction and non-tradable goods, and allowing for changes in housing expectations can remedy the previous problem. Expectations of higher housing prices generate demand for housing as an investment asset, thus, it generates higher price-to-rent. Higher residential investment promotes reallocation of labor and capital from industries producing tradable goods towards nontradable industries such as construction. Countries import tradable goods to replace the goods that were produced by the inputs reallocated to the construction sector. That is, trade deficits decouple consumption from production.====In the model, I evaluate the role of housing expectations as a driver of both housing and current account dynamics. I perform the following exercise: I input into the model the data on housing expectations collected by Case et al. (2012), which is the longest survey data on expected housing prices. This exercise does not say from where the expectations come from, but it tests the ability of the observed changes in expectations to generate plausible dynamics.====The model generates dynamics similar to the data, both in size and in timing, for housing variables (prices, residential investment, employment in construction and price-to-rent ratios) and for the current account. The model does not use exchange rate driven expenditure switching to account for the data. That is, current account dynamics are driven by changes in savings and investment decisions, not by trade balance dynamics driven by exchange rate fluctuations.====The model is also consistent with cross-sectional facts from U.S. MSAs. For example, in the model, as in the data, the correlation between price-to-rents and the trade balance-to-GDP is increasing in the housing supply elasticity. Also, in model and in the data, the same change in house prices cause larger changes in the trade balance-to-GDP for low housing supply elasticities or high borrowing constrained households.====Consistent with the new narrative of the crisis, the previous result supports that changes in people’s beliefs about house prices may have been the main driver of both the boom and bust in housing markets. However, the simulations highlight that housing demand shocks cannot be the only drivers of the boom phase, as during that period they generate counterfactual increases in interest rates because credit demand increases. Thus, the model suggests that both housing expectations and capital inflows played a role during the boom and bust associated with the Great Recession.====In terms of contribution to the literature, to my knowledge, the literature has only documented the correlations between housing variables and the current account during the pre-Great Recession period. Only this paper and Aizenman and Jinjarak (2014) study both the housing boom and bust periods. Aizenman and Jinjarak (2014) look at within country correlations for housing prices and the current account. In this paper I look at more variables and I stress the correlation across countries. That is, pre-Great Recession, the countries with housing booms had current account deficits, while those countries with current account surpluses had depressed housing markets. The situation reverted post-Great Recession. It is important to stress these cross-country patterns because they suggest international connections across housing markets. For this reason this paper studies a two country model and compares against the data the predictions for both the country with a housing boom and for the country without it.====In terms of model analysis, the paper relates to both open economy models of housing markets, and to models which study the ingredients to match the main aggregate facts of the last two decades. I briefly discuss below how this paper complements the more related work.====Punzi (2013) and Ferrero (2015) study the current account implications of housing shocks.==== Both use a two-country version of Iacoviello (2005). To maximize the collateral channel, Ferrero (2015) assumes that all agents in the domestic economy are constrained. This paper shows that models that intend to be consistent with the dynamics of both the current account and the price-to-rent ratio require an elastic supply of housing. If the model only relies on the consumption response of the impatient households with high marginal propensity to consume then price-to-rent ratios are counterfactual.====Garriga et al. (2019), in a “semi-open” economy with segmented markets, point out the importance of households’ expectations to explain the housing boom. They do not match the expectations to survey data. This paper, by directly using survey data, complements their insights in a two-country economy, which allows to look at both housing and current account dynamics across countries.====Ferrero (2015), Justiniano et al. (2017) and Favilukis et al. (2017) also show that housing demand drivers generate countercyclical interest rates. To my knowledge, this is the first paper to show that models with patient and impatient agents could lead to counterfactual price-to-rent ratios.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 documents the facts. Section 3 describes the model and Section 4 the calibration. Section 5 analyzes the theoretical mechanisms that connect housing and current account dynamics. Section 6 studies a foreign shock and the capital account. Section 7 has the quantitative exercise. Section 8 shows that the model is consistent with the cross-sectional facts. Section 9 shows that consumption has an asymmetric reaction during the housing boom versus during the bust. Section 10 concludes.",Expectations and the housing boom and bust.

Using the Canadian censuses of 2001, 2006, 2016, and the National Household Survey of 2011, this paper examines how sexual orientation associates with the patterns of homeownership. Given the 2005 legal recognition of same-sex marriage in Canada, the data allow for comparing sexual minorities with heterosexuals of the same marital status. The analysis shows that prior to the legal recognition of same-sex marriage, same-sex households’ homeownership rates were between the rates for married and common-law heterosexuals. Post-legal recognition, rather similar homeownership rates are found for common-law same-sex and common-law different-sex couples. But, married same-sex households, regardless of sex composition, are found largely less likely to own their residence than married heterosexuals. Non-negligible differences are also found regarding home values and the presence of mortgage. Various explanations are explored.","There are several reasons to expect that housing careers differ by the sex composition of couples (Leppel 2007a, 2007b; Jepsen & Jepsen 2009). Still, in many jurisdictions, same-sex partners cannot legally marry. The legal status of unions has important implications for the decision to purchase a common residence (Leppel 2007a; Jepsen and Jepsen 2009). While the demand for housing is increasing in the number of dependent children (Rosen 1979; Ioannides and Rosenthal 1994; Gyourko and Linneman 1996), fertility rates largely differ by sexual orientation (Aldén et al. 2015). Furthermore, there is a large literature devoted to the sexual orientation related earnings differentials (Badgett 1995; Klawitter 2015) and household income gaps (Berg and Lien 2002; Dilmaghani 2017a). Income is one of the strongest predictors of housing tenure type and home value (Boehm 1993; Turner and Luea 2009). Finally, the differentiated residential location choice of sexual minorities, by city (Black et al. 2000, 2002; Florida 2003) and by neighbourhood (Ghaziani 2015; Matthews and Besemer 2015), is well documented. These locational preferences have implications for homeownership and home value (Borjas 2002; Jepsen and Jepsen 2009).====Despite the above-mentioned reasons to expect homeownership gaps by sexual orientation and the importance of these gaps for various other socioeconomic outcomes, the empirical evidence on the subject is slim (Jepsen and Jepsen 2009). It is well-documented that the benefits of homeownership extend beyond its contribution to individual wealth (Green and White 1996; Glaeser and Sacerdote 2000). Homeowners have a stronger incentive to invest in their neighbourhoods than renters, since their investments are capitalized in the value of their homes (DiPasqual and Glaeser 1999). Some scholars even suggest that homeownership creates better citizens (DiPasquale and Glaeser 1999; Dietz and Haurin 2003; McCabe 2013). Moreover, homeownership is shown to be associated with political views (Verberg 2000; Kohl 2018) and voting patterns (Fischel 2009; Holian 2011; McGregor and Spicer 2016; Rugh 2019). The effects of race and ethnicity (Constant et al. 2009), immigrant status (Shamsuddin and DeVoretz 1998; Maroto and Aylsworth 2016), and even religious identity (Dilmaghani 2017b) on housing tenure type have been investigated for several countries including Canada. The motivation for the investigation of the gaps associated with immutable aspects of individual identity, such as race and ethnicity, lies in its importance for the socioeconomic integration of minorities and its impact on intergenerational mobility (Hochstenbach 2018; Hubers et al. 2018; Rugh 2019).====But, there are only 3 previous economic studies on the implications of sexual orientation for homeownership (Leppel 2007a, 2007b; Jepsen and Jepsen 2009), all of which use data from the United States. Jepsen and Jepsen (2009) found lower homeownership rates for cohabiting gay males and lesbians compared with married heterosexuals. Compatible patterns have been reported in Leppel (2007a, 2007b). Since these US studies use data from year 2000, they could not assess whether the patterns would change, should same-sex marriage become legally recognized. The present paper adds to the literature by investigating how sexual orientation relates to the real estate wealth accumulation patterns in Canada, also accounting for the effects of marital status.====In Canada, same-sex marriage became legally recognized nationwide in July 2005. Therefore, it is now possible to investigate how the housing careers of same-sex couples compare with heterosexual couples of the same marital status. The present paper uses the Canadian censuses of 2001, 2006, 2016, and the National Household Survey of 2011, to compare the housing careers of same-sex couples with heterosexual couples. The 2001 data predate the legal recognition of same-sex marriage, while the 2006, 2011, and 2016 data cover the post-legal recognition period. Unfortunately, Canadian same-sex couples could not be reliably identified in the earlier censuses, as the presence of same-sex spouses has been assumed a coding error for the larger portion of the observations and the data were adjusted accordingly (Turcotte et al. 2003). The estimations show that the pre-legal recognition patterns are not very different than those found in the United States (Jepsen and Jepsen 2009). In the post-legal recognition data, married same-sex households, regardless of sex composition, are found considerably less likely to own their residence than their heterosexual counterparts. These gaps, of almost equal sizes for both male and both female households, do not appear to have subsided from 2006 to 2016. In addition to homeownership rates, the patterns of home value and the presence of mortgage are investigated, resulting in non-negligible gaps by sexual orientation. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section II reviews the related literature. Section III presents the data and the methodology. Section IV reports the results on homeownership gaps. Section V explores the gaps in home value and the presence of mortgage.

Is there a causal link between those two phenomena? This paper takes advantage of a unique natural experiment in China, which reformed the nationwide employer-based public housing system in 1998. This reform created an exogenous variation in housing demand among urban households. Using a difference-in-differences estimation strategy, we find evidence that the reform increased household saving rates during the reform period (1998–2001) by shifting the cost of housing services from the state to households. We also provide evidence that suggests that the 1998 housing reform affects household saving behaviors even after the reform period (2002–2009).","In the past few decades, the Chinese housing market has dramatically changed. According to the Chinese Urban Household Survey (UHS), the home ownership rate among urban households was around 20% in the early 1990s, when most of the urban houses were publicly owned. The rate climbed sharply after 1998 and reached 90% in 2009, which is among the highest in the world. By comparison, the 2010 American home ownership rate was only 65.1% according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Such a rapid privatization of the housing market was unprecedented in Chinese history. During the same period, the average floor area per capita of Chinese households tripled, from 13 square meters in 1992 to 32 square meters in 2009 (Table A1), which indicates a significant improvement in living conditions in less than two decades. This increased housing demand led to soaring prices—housing prices almost tripled in China’s major cities between 2000 and 2009 (Wu et al., 2012). As suggested by Fang et al. (2016), an 8 to 10 price-to-income ratio has been reached in major Chinese cities.====Despite such dramatic changes in the housing market, very little is known about the consequences. This paper fills in the gap by linking China’s volatile housing market with its economic imbalance, especially the country’s unusually high saving rates. China has witnessed a significant increase in savings rates in the past two decades, with household saving as a share of disposable income nearly doubling, from 16% in 1992 to 30% in 2009. This increase resulted in a large current account surplus, which is considered a major contributor to global macroeconomic imbalances and a trigger of the recent global financial crisis (Chamon et al., 2013). From a theoretical perspective, the rising household saving rate seems puzzling because it was accompanied by rapid growth in household income. The permanent income hypothesis theory suggests that consumption instead of saving should increase with income. Both the importance of understanding global current account imbalances and the theoretical conflict have motivated a growing body of research into this unusual saving behavior. Various reasons have been given to explain the ”Chinese saving puzzle,” including an aging population, lack of social safety nets, precautionary saving motives, an underdeveloped financial market, and a cultural tradition of thrift (Modigliani, Cao, 2004, Chamon, Prasad, 2010, Chamon, Liu, Prasad, 2013).====Rising housing demand has been mentioned as one of the explanations behind rising saving rates; however, current evidence on this mechanism is still relatively limited. For example, Chamon and Prasad (2010) give several potential explanations for China’s rising saving rates during the transition period and mention that the privatization of the housing market created a private burden and new motives for saving during the transition period. In addition, Wei and Zhang (2011) and Wei et al. (2017) argue that families with sons tend to save more for buying a house to improve their sons’ competitiveness in the marriage market. The main challenge of identifying and quantifying the causal effects of housing demand on household saving is the endogenous problem, because unobserved abilities or preferences could increase housing demand and household savings simultaneously, which creates a spurious correlation.====In this paper, we deal with the endogenous problem by taking advantage of a unique natural experiment in China that reformed the employer-provided public housing system in 1998 and, thus, created an exogenous variation in housing demand among urban households. Before the reform, the majority of urban residents worked for a state-owned enterprise and were living in public housing units provided by their employers with zero or highly subsidized rents.==== To transform the public housing system into a market-based system, the reform abolished the provision of public housing across the nation, which created sudden and unexpected changes in housing demand among urban households. Before the reform, public-sector employees who lived in houses that lacked essential facilities expected their employers to help them improve their living conditions by allocating them a public house, so they did not need to save much. The 1998 reform eliminated that possibility. Now the only way for employees to improve their living conditions was to buy a private house on the market, which was usually expensive and forced them to increase their savings. In a sense, this reform acted like a negative wealth shock for those households. In contrast, the reform allowed public-sector employees who already lived in good-quality public housing units to purchase their houses at below-market prices. Because they were satisfied with their current living conditions, they had fewer incentives to save for housing. Hence, the reform provided exogenous variations in households’ needs for housing demand, which allows us to better investigate the reform’s impacts on household savings.====The primary data source for this paper is the UHS, which is a repeated cross-sectional data set that covers more than 230,000 households across 16 provinces between 1992 and 2009. As far as we know, it is the only nationally representative household data set in China that contains yearly information dating back to the early 1990s. This feature enables us to study the link between the 1998 housing reform and the rising household saving rates.====Using this data set and the exogenous variation created by the 1998 reform, we provide two sets for empirical tests of the housing demand hypothesis. First, we adopt a difference-in-difference (DID) approach and compare public-sector employees’ saving rates before and after the reform for households that had and had not obtained high-quality housing under the old system.==== We also consider another control group, which includes households that did not include state employees. Those households did not expect to receive public housing benefits before or after the reform, so they were not affected by the reform except through the general equilibrium effect. The DID model allows us to use the policy shocks by comparing changes in saving rates among otherwise similar households before and after the housing reform. We find a significantly larger increase in saving rates of households that lived in low-quality housing units in 1999–2001 compared to those in 1992–1998, which suggests that the sudden increase in housing demand played an important role in explaining the rising household savings during the reform period. Overall, our baseline estimation suggests that the household saving rate increases by around 2 percentage points during the reform period (1998–2002). The average household saving rate increased by about 4 percentage points from 17% in 1998 to 21% in 2002, suggesting that the reform can explain about half of the increase in the household saving rates.====More important, because of the rising housing prices and underdeveloped mortgage market, we expect that the suddenly generated housing demand kept driving up China’s saving rates even after the 1998 reform. To test this conjecture, we explore household saving rates between 2002 and 2009. In particular, we divide households by whether they obtained their housing from the old system or the private market (public and private housing residents). We find that private housing residents save about 1.3% more than public housing residents, which suggests that rising housing demands were indeed contributing to the high saving rates in more recent years.====The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces China’s household saving rate and the development of its urban housing market over time. Section 3 describes the theoretical framework for how the housing reform boosts household savings. Section 4 describes the UHS data.

Using commercial rental housing transaction records and dynamic bilateral subway ==== from 2010-2015, we build the measure of the accessibility to business clusters and low-cost rental housing through the subway network at a high spatial resolution. Taking advantage of exogenous shocks from the network reconfiguration due to the rapid subway expansion in Beijing, we employ a matched difference-in-differences estimation in multiple periods to identify the causal elasticity estimate of the new firm formation with respect to the accessibility to business clusters and low-cost rental housing. We demonstrate that the subway network is more conducive to firm establishments. The effects are more salient for firms in skill-intensive sectors. New skill-intensive firms increase by 0.44% given a 1% increase in the accessibility to business clusters. The elasticity of new skill-intensive firms with respect to the accessibility to low-cost rental housing is about 0.74. Our findings that transit-oriented development leads to a higher concentration of new skill-intensive businesses, pointing to the importance of an efficient public transit system capable of serving the dispersed workforce and improving the efficiency of firm location choice.","New and young firms are crucial for net job creation and they are also a key driver of economic growth. Their location is a topic of great interest in economics. An extensive literature is devoted to examining what could shape the spatial distribution of business establishments across cities and across industries within a city.==== These empirical studies demonstrate that the size of the local demand, the cost and the quality of the local labor force, the presence of agglomeration economies are all at work facilitating new firm births (Chinitz, 1961; Jacobs, 1970; Audretsch and Fritsch, 1994; Reynolds, 1994; Saxenian, 1994; Armington and Acs, 2002; (Glaeser et al., 2010).====Much of the prior work in urban economics focuses on estimating the effect of agglomeration economies on new firm formation, highlighting the importance of the metropolitan environment (Carlton, 1983) and the geographical attenuation of agglomeration effects (Rosenthal and Strange, 2003). While there is ample research documenting cross-city evidence, the within-city approach is rare, possibly due to the difficult identification coming from variation in the data within the metropolitan area. Rosenthal and Strange (2005) document the extensive variation within the New York consolidated metropolitan statistical area in the types of entrepreneurship. Their empirical evidence suggests that the agglomeration economies decay with distance, which is consistent with theoretical work on agglomerations using a with-city approach (Anderson, 2014); (Arzaghi and Henderson, 2005).====The rise of agglomeration economies is accompanied by transportation technological advances and massive urban transportation infrastructure investment, which substantially reduces transportation costs and facilitates commutes within the city. The theoretical basis for new firm formation draws largely on location theories and new economic geography, explaining firm births, deaths, and location choice with respect to some location-based characteristics. The external benefits of agglomeration economies (spatial proximity) related to the market size effect of input-out linkages arise from the clustering of economic activity within and across industries. This theory also sheds light on the spatial organization of business establishments arising from the minimization of production and transportation costs. In this regard, the availability of efficient transportation networks contributes to agglomeration economies and can reduce the production and transportation costs incurred by both incumbent and new firms, which is a crucial location factor that influences within-city labor mobility and the resulting balance between agglomeration and dispersion forces.====In a within-city scenario, casual observations also suggest that firms tend to cluster to enjoy the benefits from agglomeration economies, while the housing in these clusters is not affordable for workers. This urban phenomenon characterizes substantial job-housing mismatch in mega-cities, which is well theoretically founded in urban economics. In addition to agglomeration forces, a substantial literature demonstrates that affordable, accessible housing influences the productivity of establishments’ local environment (Li, Wu, 2014, Corradin, Popov, 2015, Chen, Hu, 2018, Chen, Hu, Lin, 2018). Firms make their location choices by trading off a central-agglomeration force against the lower wages (lower commuting cost and lower housing rent) in peripheral places. From a perspective of public transit and urban spatial structure, our paper adds another piece of evidence to the literature on the effect of low-cost housing availability on entrepreneurial activity.====While the arguments from location theories and new economic geography are true for firm location in general, new firm birth is no exception to these theories pinpointing the mechanism through which the spatial distribution of economic activity is achieved. In addition to the determinants of new firm formation that are widely documented in the literature, we also account for the effects of efficient transportation networks and the availability of low-cost housing on business establishments. Entrepreneurs are more likely to start their businesses in the locations with good access to business clusters and low-cost housing through public transit. Improvements in public transit system decrease the production and transportation costs, increasing the likelihood of new firm formation and changing the balance between central-agglomeration and dispersion forces. These changes consequently reshapes the spatial distribution of firm births.====This paper takes a within-city approach to study the economic geography of new firm formation, examining how the transit to agglomeration and low-cost rental housing accessibility influences the births of new businesses. Specifically, we look at Beijing to empirically examine how new firms trade off central-agglomeration forces against dispersion forces (low wages in peripheral places), exploiting the variations in the transit-to-opportunity accessibility coming from subway network reconfiguration due to rapid subway network expansion during our study period. This within-city approach to studying urban form, spatial structure, and the role of public transit has been widely used in the economics literature (Fujita, Ogawa, 1982, Lucas, Rossi-Hansberg, 2002, Wheaton, 2004)Timonthy and Wheaton, 2011; Jing and Liao (2019). Following the within-city approach in this literature, we study new firm birth and its location choice rather than general firms. We ask two key research questions in our paper: (1) Does the improved accessibility to business clusters and low-cost housing by the subway network foster new firm formation? (2) Is there heterogeneity across firm types?====We focus on Beijing in this paper for several reasons. First, Beijing is one of the biggest entrepreneurial ecosystem for startups in China, housing 43% of Chinese unicorns (twice the number of unicorns than Shanghai, but more than three times the aggregated valuation), largely because of a great supply of entrepreneurs, VC capital, and engineering from the two top Chinese universities (Tsinghua University and Peking University).==== Second, Beijing has witnessed a rise of agglomeration economies, which reshapes its urban form and characterizes serious job-housing mismatch. Third, Beijing faces a growing housing affordability crisis. The monthly housing expense as a percentage of monthly disposable income of Beijing is almost 110% in 2010 ((Yao, 2011).==== The housing affordability issue dampens the burgeoning entrepreneurial activity. Lastly, empirical work has shown that the subway system alleviates the intense road congestion (Anderson, 2014, Yang, Chen, Qin, Lu, Liu, 2018, Gu, Jiang, Zhang, Zou), which influences the underlying urban spatial structure. Beijing subway is the second longest subway system in the world and has experienced rapid expansion since 2008. This subway construction boom greatly alters the accessibility to business clusters and low-cost housing and thus influences the geography of new firm formation.====Much empirical research examines the effect of agglomeration economies on the direct estimates (Henderson, 2003) or correlates (Glaeser and Mare, 2001; Henderson et al., 1995) of productivity of an establishment’s local environment. Our paper is concerned with only one productivity correlate — establishment births, primarily due to the data limitation. We use firm registration records to build measures of new firm formation and agglomeration economies (as measured by the density of incumbent firms). In addition to agglomeration economies, we also measure the dispersion force as measured by the supply of low-cost rental housing. We specifically focus on low-cost rental housing because (1) a majority of startups are headed by post-80’s generation or younger leaders (Hurun Research Institute, WalktheChat Analysis) and (2) most of them cannot afford the housing in Beijing or do not have residence permits (i.e., “Hukou”). To calculate the accessibility to these urban opportunities (business clusters and housing), we retrieve bilateral subway travel times at a high spatial resolution (1 km × 1 km) and compute the commuting time-weighted urban opportunities following the standard approach in the literature (Ahlfeldt, 2009; Ahlfeldt and Maennig 2010; Ahlfeldt, 2011;(Donaldson and Hornbeck, 2016),Hidalgo 2017). We combine firm birth data with data on incumbent firms and low-cost housing availability to estimate the impact of agglomeration economies and low-cost housing on new business creation.====A challenge in identifying the causal effect of transit-to-opportunity accessibility lies in that the association between high accessibility to business clusters and low-cost rental housing and new firm formation might be mainly due to selection on unobservables in firm location choice. For instance, the location of a subway station is planned to provide easy access to important urban amenities and is thus likely to be highly correlated with local neighborhood characteristics. To address this critical identification issue, we take advantage of the variations in the dynamic subway development in Beijing and employ a difference-in-differences strategy on a matched sample to estimate the causal impact of improved subway network connectivity on new firm formation.====Specifically, the identification strategy in this paper builds primarily on the butterfly effect in urban public transportation introduced in Jing (2018). Change in a small part of the transportation network can lead to the reconfiguration of travel routes, affecting the economic activity at all vertices in the entire network. Specifically, the quasi-experiment is to assign all neighborhoods (1 km  ×  1 km grid cells) that are in proximity to existing subway stations to the treatment group. The variations in the accessibility in these treated locations are plausibly exogenous because they are generated mainly through the topological reconfiguration of stations and tracks, which are not likely to be associated in any changes in the local neighborhoods.====To mitigate any selection on observables, we use propensity score matching to construct credible counterfactuals for a treated location had it not been in proximity to any subway stations. We estimate a difference-in-differences regression in multiple periods on a matched sample to rule out other non-causal channels through unobservables (e.g., pre-existing differences in treated and non-treated locations, entrepreneurial boom, economic trends, etc.). Our difference-in-differences strategy works well after pre-treatment differences are negligible between comparison groups after matching and the butterfly effect on the entire network is as good as random. Therefore, the effect we estimate is likely to be causal.====Our results demonstrate that the locations with better accessibility to business clusters and low-cost rental housing through the subway network gain more new skill-intensive firms, suggesting that burgeoning businesses value external benefits of improved subway network connectivity to attract labor. The baseline result is consistent with Glaeser et al. (2010) where they argue that establishment rate is higher, both across cities and across industries within cities, when cost is lower (i.e., paying lower wages due to lower commuting cost and better accessibility to low-cost housing) and the place is endowed with a greater supply of entrepreneurship (improved mobility among the entrepreneurial workforce within the city). Our estimation results point to an elasticity estimate of new firm formation with respect to the accessibility to low-cost housing of 0.35, while the elasticity with respect to low-cost rental housing is about 0.59.====Importantly, we find a more significant effect on firm births in skill-intensive sectors. New skill-intensive firms increase by 0.44% given a 1% increase in the accessibility to business clusters. The elasticity of new skill-intensive firms with respect to the accessibility to low-cost rental housing is about 0.74. The results are consistent with the literature on the role of local social interactions in determining spatial clustering of entrepreneurship (Minniti, 2005; Giannetti and Simonov, 2009; Andersson and Larsson, 2016), implying a surging demand for agglomeration economies of skill-intensive businesses. We also show heterogeneity across income levels and firm sizes. The results remain robust for various controls.====To the best of our knowledge, these elasticities have never been estimated in the previous literature. Our results highlight the vital role of an efficient public transit system in helping new firms in skill-intensive sectors to balance housing costs with agglomeration economies and have important implications for welfare analysis of public transit development.====Our study is mostly related to the literature on firms’ within-city location choice, which generally shows positive externalities generated by industry agglomeration and universities (Audretsch, Lehmann, Warning, 2005, Glaeser, Kerr, 2009, Ahlfeldt, Redding, Sturm, Wolf, 2015). We provide new empirical evidence about the trade-off between commuting cost and external benefits of agglomeration to the existing literature (Fujita, Ogawa, 1982, Timothy, Wheaton, 2001, Lucas, Rossi-Hansberg, 2002, Zheng, Peiser, Zhang, 2009),Zheng, 2014; Ferdinando, 2016). Fujita and Ogawa (1982)’s pioneering work presents the concept and formalization of productivity potential. They also derive the conditions under which a mixed land-use equilibrium exists. Some other research discusses the within-city spatial distribution of business and the causes of spatial heterogeneity (Okamoto, 2007, Glaeser, Kerr, 2009, Allen, Arkolakis, 2014), Kolympiris 2014.====In particular, our contribution is that we directly study the firm location choice with respect to subway network connectivity improvement and document a more significant effect for skill-intensive firms, suggesting a higher demand of skill-intensive employment for efficient public transit networks to better utilize the external agglomeration benefits and attract enough labor. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first empirical study that examines the role of transportation cost reduction in facilitating new firm formation by treating both central-agglomeration forces and housing costs as the determinants of firm location choice. This approach provides a bridge between the empirical new economic geography literature on intra-city firm location and the empirical literature on the spatial mismatch between population and jobs.====The relationship between transportation improvement and new firm formation is not an untouched topic in the literature. The link between these two variables is well discussed in theoretical work in location theories and new economic geography. This strand of theoretical literature suggests that changes in transport costs alter the relative attractiveness of a location to firms.==== A scarce literature studies the effect from the urban transportation system on the number of establishments and generally find positive effects (Smith and Florida, 1994; Fotopoulos and Spence; Coughlin and Segev, 2000; Holl, 2004a, 2004b, 2004c).==== Rather than only looking at public transportation infrastructure presence, we also consider the accessibility to urban opportunities through the infrastructure (subway station in our case) and show that the accessibility to business clusters and housing with a lower cost is valued by new firms.====An efficient transport network connects neighborhoods better and gives the rise of agglomeration economies. The literature on the benefits and costs of public transit development generally finds positive effects of transit proximity or transit to job accessibility on housing and land hedonic prices or gradients (Baum-Snow and Kahn, 2000; McMillen and McDonald, 2004; Ahlfeldt and Wendland, 2009; Ahlfeldt, 2011). Literature also documents the positive aggregate productivity and employment growth effects of public transit development (Duranton and Turner 2012; Chatman and Noland 2014). Severen (2018) finds that Los Angeles Metro Rail increases aggregate welfare by $246 million annually. In contrast, Jing(2018) use a short mass-rapid-transit line opening in Singapore as a quasi-natural experiment and provide an estimate of the welfare benefit of $1.57 billion, which exceeds a construction cost of $1.12 billion. Our work is silent on the welfare analysis but adds new empirical evidence to this strand of literature by accounting for potentially important benefits of improved public transit network connectivity and the enhanced efficiency of new firm location choice.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides a brief background of the Beijing housing market. Section 3 describes data sources and measurements. Section 4 outlines the empirical framework and introduces our identification strategy. Section 5 presents empirical results.

The premium cut, which reduced monthly payments the same amount as a three-quarter percentage point drop in the mortgage rate, increased the purchasing power of the typical FHA borrower by 6 percent. Our analysis shows FHA borrowers increased the value of the housing they purchased by 2.5 percentage points relative to a control group of borrowers in areas with minimal FHA presence. The rise in spending reflected an increase in constant-quality home prices, with no significant change in the quality of housing purchased by FHA buyers. We also estimate that the premium cut induced approximately 17,000 households to become first-time homebuyers in the initial year after the cut, an increase that fell far short of the FHA's projection.","A primary goal of federal housing policy is to encourage homeownership and investment in housing by subsidizing homeowners’ borrowing costs and by making mortgages available to households with limited resources for a down payment and low credit scores. Broadly speaking, economists have few reliable, data-driven estimates of the impact of these policies on homeownership, house prices, or housing affordability. Understanding how federal policy affects the homeownership rate and the value of housing purchased is difficult because large changes to federal policy are infrequent, tend to be universally applied, and are often correlated with significant macroeconomic shocks.====In this paper, we use a recent, quasi-natural experiment to investigate how exogenous changes in federal policy affect housing demand for borrowers that tend to be on the edge of homeownership. On January 7, 2015, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) reduced the annual mortgage premium it charges to guarantee new loans processed on or after January 26==== by 50 basis points, from 1.35 percent of the loan balance to 0.85 percent. The effect of this cut was to increase the purchasing power of the typical FHA borrower by about 6 percent.==== This announcement was a surprise to the marketplace (Bhutta and Ringo, 2017)====, and it was not accompanied by pricing changes at the other major federal agencies that guarantee mortgages – the government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the GSEs) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Because the premium cut was unanticipated, it solves the usual problem of finding exogenous variation in borrowing costs with which to estimate the effects on housing demand.====We use a differences-in-differences (diff-in-diff) approach to analyze the impact of the FHA premium cut. Even though the cut was a surprise that affected a subset of market participants, establishing a compelling diff-in-diff analysis poses a challenge for three reasons. The first challenge is that the premium cut applied to all FHA borrowers. For identification, we compare the change in behavior for FHA borrowers to another group of homebuyers. Our analysis uses GSE borrowers as the control group. A potential concern is that the borrowers who select GSE loans could be different than those who choose FHA loans in ==== ways that cannot be controlled for in a diff-in-diff regression. Persistent unobservable differences are not a problem because they are removed by the diff-in-diff. The potential threat to identification comes from changes in unobservables for FHA borrowers over the estimation window that differ from any such changes for GSE borrowers. To reduce this risk, our estimation strategy uses a relatively short window so that any changes to unobservables are likely to be small. In addition, we show that the sorting of borrowers into FHA and GSE loans can be predicted very accurately from pricing differences between these loans that depend solely on the borrower's credit score and loan-to-value ratio. This suggests that the observable differences between FHA and GSE borrowers – which we control for in the diff-in-diff – are far more important than unobservable differences.====The second challenge arises from the fluid boundary between FHA and GSE borrowers. We show that the premium cut induced a substantial number of GSE borrowers to switch to FHA loans. As a result, the observable characteristics of both the FHA treatment group and the GSE control group could have changed after the premium cut. We account for this potential change in mix by including controls for a broad set of borrower characteristics in our baseline regressions and our robustness checks. The controls in our baseline regressions include the borrower's county of residence, income, credit score, gender, race, ethnicity, and whether the borrower sought pre-approval for the loan; robustness tests add the borrower's loan-to-value ratio and debt-to-income ratio (which is not available for some loans) to the baseline set of controls.====The final challenge is that the FHA policy change indirectly affected other homebuyers in the same geographic market. Indeed, we document that the premium cut boosted constant-quality house prices in census tracts with a relatively high share of FHA mortgages and this price increase spilled over to non-FHA borrowers in the tract, which reduced their purchasing power. To minimize the influence of these spillover effects, our control group consists of borrowers receiving a GSE mortgage in census tracts where FHA mortgages are infrequent. This control group is locationally separate from our treatment group, which consists of FHA borrowers living in census tracts where FHA mortgages account for a relatively high proportion of all home purchase mortgages.====To conduct the analysis, we merge data from a number of sources. Our combined dataset contains information on a large share of the FHA and GSE mortgages originated in 23 counties across the country during 2013–2015. We show that in the initial year after the premium cut, the prices of FHA-financed homes accelerated about 2.5 percentage points vis-à-vis GSE-financed homes, implying a semi-elasticity of housing demand to the mortgage rate (the intensive margin of demand) of roughly 3.4 among FHA homebuyers.==== This result provides a calibration target for macroeconomists looking to anchor a model-predicted interest-rate elasticity of housing demand. We also show that rising constant-quality prices due to stronger demand fully accounted for the 2.5% increase; we find no evidence that FHA buyers opted for homes with more amenities or a better location.====In addition to this analysis of market impacts, we evaluate the effectiveness of the policy change in boosting homeownership. When the premium cut was announced, the FHA anticipated that it would spur 250,000 new homebuyers to purchase their first home over the next three years – an average of roughly 83,000 per year over 2015–2017.==== Although the number of FHA first-time buyers increased about 176,000 in the first year after the premium cut, we estimate that the premium cut itself was responsible for only about 17,000 of these buyers. The 95% confidence band around this point estimate is relatively wide, but even the top end of the band is less than half of the FHA's projection. The rest of the 176,000 increase in FHA first-time buyers in 2015 consisted of borrowers who likely would have received mortgages backed by other government agencies or borrowers who would have chosen to buy homes because of trend growth in the economy, unrelated to the premium cut. For first-time buyers using FHA mortgages, our point estimate implies a one-year semi-elasticity of homeownership to interest rates of 4.2.====The premium cut created losers as well as winners and implied a redistribution of wealth. In addition to the direct benefit for FHA borrowers, existing homeowners gained from the induced increase in constant-quality home prices in areas with a sizable FHA presence. The benefits for these two groups came at the expense of homebuyers who did not use FHA financing, as the rise in constant-quality home prices eroded their purchasing power. As discussed in Section 4, we estimate that in 2015 there were about 500,000 non-FHA first-time buyers who lived in census tracts with a significant presence of FHA borrowers. We also estimate that each of these non-FHA first-time buyers paid an average of roughly $6200 extra for their home as a result of the premium cut. Thus, non-FHA first-time buyers as a group paid about $3.1 billion extra due to the premium cut (500,000 such buyers x $6200 per home).====As noted above, our findings should be of interest to macroeconomists studying the effect of federal policy on housing demand, house prices, and homeownership. Recent papers have analyzed the effect of tax policy (Sommer and Sullivan, 2018), government mortgage guarantees (Jeske et al., 2013 and Gete and Zecchetto, 2018), financing constraints and interest rates (Favilukus et al., 2017), limits on debt-to-income ratios (Greenwald, 2018), and alternative mortgage products (Chambers et al., 2009 and Corbae and Quintin, 2015). The authors in this literature take care to match many features of the micro and macro data, as emphasized by Davis and van Nieuwerburgh (2015) and Piazzesi and Schneider (2016). Some of these macro models explicitly include an equation that links the mortgage rate to an endogenously determined risk-free rate and a gap between these two rates that is set outside of the model; others have a wedge between the risk-free rate and the mortgage interest rate that is endogenously determined by frictions or government institutions inside the model. Thus, all of these models have an embedded elasticity of housing prices and quantities with respect to the difference of the mortgage interest rate and the risk-free rate.==== To our knowledge, however, authors in this literature have not checked if their models replicate the interest-rate elasticities of house prices and quantities because these elasticities ====. Our paper provides macroeconomists with calibration targets for these elasticities with respect to exogenous shifts in the cost of mortgage borrowing.====There are only a few papers besides ours that estimate the impact of interest rates on housing quantities and prices at the household level. Two key predecessors to our paper are Adelino et al. (2014) and DeFusco and Paciorek (2017). Adelino et al. (2014) use changes over time in the maximum size for GSE loans (the conforming loan limit) to estimate the semi-elasticity of housing demand among existing buyers (the intensive margin). Their estimates span a wide range – from 1.2 to 9.1 – with the estimates depending on the assumed rate spread between conforming and jumbo loans and the estimated change in house prices. DeFusco and Paciorek (2017) study bunching around the conforming loan limit to estimate the interest elasticity of mortgage debt at the household level. They find a one percentage point increase in the mortgage interest rate reduces the size of the first-lien mortgage taken out (not house prices or quantities) by 2–3%. This range is a bit below – but not significantly different than – our estimate along the intensive margin of roughly 3.4.====Our analysis complements that of Bhutta and Ringo (2017), who also study the impact of the FHA premium cut. Bhutta and Ringo focus mainly on the increase in the number of home purchase loans induced by the premium cut (the extensive margin). Their results fall within the relatively wide confidence band for our estimate. Bhutta and Ringo also include a brief analysis of the impact of the premium cut on house prices and find no evidence of such price effects, contrary to our results. We believe our approach, which uses a large property-level dataset to create well-defined treatment and control groups, has more power to uncover price effects than the Bhutta–Ringo analysis, which relies for the most part on estimated median home prices at the zip-code level.====Finally, we would note that our results reflect the combined influence of household responses and market conditions. The FHA premium cut occurred during the 29==== month of a national seller's market based on data published by the National Association of Realtors (NAR).==== With tight inventories of homes for sale, we show that the boost to demand from the premium cut resulted in a substantial rise in home prices and an erosion of purchasing power for non-FHA buyers. Had the same policy change been implemented in a buyer's market with more plentiful supply, our estimated impact on prices might have been smaller and the number of new homebuyers greater.",The Impact of Federal Housing Policy on Housing Demand and Homeownership: Evidence from a Quasi-Experiment,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137719300075,31 January 2020,2020,Research Article,124.0

We test the implications of the model with data from the Las Vegas metropolitan area and find that housing markets respond roughly the same in the face of increases and decreases in gas prices. Supply elasticity is evidently relatively elastic in response to both expansions and contractions, despite expectations that supply is much more inelastic when markets contract when gas prices increase. Simulating the effect of a 10% increase in gas prices from a carbon tax, we find that homes near the center of town rise on average $532 while homes beyond 5 miles fall on average $1,064. These findings are consistent with negative rent gradient results reported in Coulson and Engle (1987) and Larson and Zhao (2017).","Studies of the link between transport costs generally and housing markets have been the subject of a literature that goes back to the founding of modern urban economics. One of the most fundamental comparative static predictions in urban economics is that in the cross-section property prices vary negatively with distance from central job locations due to the fact that distant residents must be compensated for their higher commuting costs. This theoretical prediction was confirmed by cross-sectional studies of property prices in Muth (1969), Yinger (1979) and Coulson (1991) among others.====The literature also connects changes in commuting costs with changes in home values. Much of this literature (Voith, 1993; Tse and Chan, 2003; Yiu and Wong, 2005; Martinez and Viegas, 2009) is based on changes in the price of public transport. Studies based on automobile commuting are less numerous. An early example is Coulson and Engle (1987), who used the gasoline price increases of the 1980s to estimate the link between commuting costs and the suburban-central city differential. Molloy and Shan (2013) find no significant effect of gasoline prices on house prices, except in areas where the housing supply is constrained by regulation or geography and where demand for housing is growing. In those conditions, higher gasoline prices negatively affect home prices where commutes are long. However, they do find that an increase in gas prices lowers housing supply growth in areas with long commutes (i.e. greater than 24 min on average). The distinction between times and places where housing supply is fixed and when it is not plays a role in our modeling below. In an analysis somewhat similar to ours, Larson and Zhao (2017) develop a model of a monocentric city which is oil-using and potentially oil-exporting. Their model and empirical findings support the prediction that home price changes in the inner areas of such cities positively correlate with the price of oil. House prices farther than 15 miles from the city-center correlate negatively with oil prices owing to higher transportation costs. However these effects are modified in oil exporting areas, such that all home prices rise when the price of oil goes up.====In this paper, we also develop a theoretical model for the effect of transport costs on rent gradients (and thus home values) across a city. A key aspect of our analysis is that we show that the theoretical effect depends greatly on the assumption that is made about the elasticity of housing supply. The traditional analysis assumes that housing supply is perfectly elastic as gasoline prices either rise or fall. Larson and Zhao, for example, make such an assumption, and like us, find that when there is a change in the price of gas (or more broadly, any change in commuting cost, the rent gradient pivots around a central point. But the central pivot depends on the assumption of perfectly elastic housing supply. However, we move beyond the standard model to note that if housing supply is inelastic, the pivot will not be at some interior point, but at the fringe of the city. We also go beyond previous empirical examinations of the link between gas and house prices in allowing this pivot to differ as prices increase or decrease, in effect allowing the supply elasticity to differ, as suggested by e.g. Glaeser and Gyourko (2005).====We test the model's hypotheses using data from 874,895 home sales in Clark County, Nevada from January 1987 through December 2010. Our empirical findings support of implications of our theoretical model. First, we find that distance to the business center of Las Vegas has a negative and significant effect on home values, all else equal, thus confirming the theoretical comparative static result with respect to distance. We also find that when gasoline prices increase, home values increase in areas with relatively low distances from the city center and decrease farther out. Likewise, when gasoline prices fall, home values fall in areas with relatively low distances and increase farther out. We estimate the distance at which the effect of gasoline prices on home values changes sign, i.e. the pivot distance. Tests of the pivot point results provide evidence that home values actually do respond roughly equivalently to increases and decreases in gasoline prices. This is consistent with the idea that housing supply is fairly elastic in both expansions and contractions.====This study makes several contributions to the literature. The first is the theoretical model that illustrates how rent gradients can pivot and shift as transportation costs increase and decrease under different assumptions about the elasticity of housing supply. Our approach accounts for potential asymmetry in the optimality of the built environment in that the supply of homes is more inelastic when demand falls than when it rises. The second contribution tests the theoretical model in a detailed location-specific exploration of the relationship between gasoline prices and home values and finds support for its hypotheses. It thus extends and complements the results of both Molloy and Shan (2013) and Larson and Zhao (2017).====The results can also inform the debate on the use of carbon taxes as a strategy to mitigate global warming. Much literature on this topic has discussed the distributional outcomes of a carbon tax (Caron et al., 2018; EPA, 2010; Hassett et al., 2009; Rausch et al., 2011 and Mathur and Morris, 2014) and how the economic incidence on households varies across different ways of using the revenue. Less attention has been paid to how the tax can affect households via the value of their assets. Knittel and Sandler (2011) have discussed how changes in gas prices can bring about changes in the prices of high and low mileage automobiles. A naïve analysis of the impact of gasoline price changes on home values (brought about by a carbon tax or otherwise) would simply calculate the extra expense consumers pay at the pump. Our analysis suggests that this is mistaken because housing prices change in response to that extra expenditure. And the way they change in turn depends on the elasticity of housing supply.====The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents the theoretical model and the testable hypotheses that derive from it. Section 3 explains the estimation models we use to test the hypotheses. Section 4 describes the data. Section 5 summarizes results from the hedonic model to test prediction of a negative slope of rent gradient. Section 6 presents results from repeat sales method to test hypotheses related to falling and rising gas prices, and presents the impact of a typical carbon tax on house prices. Section 7 presents analyses over sub-periods and other robustness checks. Section 8 summarizes the paper and offers concluding remarks.

Using US Census data from 1970 to 2010, I find evidence for tipping behavior amongst income groups. This is strongest when the population is split at the 10th percentile of income. In this case, average tipping points range from 7 to 12%. When the proportion of people below the 10th percentile in a neighborhood exceeds said tipping point, the decrease in those above the 10th percentile will be from 5 to 14%. Robustness checks indicate that these effects are not misinterpreted racial tipping points, nor a result of peoples’ income percentile changing over their lifetime. Effects are strongest in neighborhoods with more school-aged children, suggesting that income tipping is driven by concerns that the provision of ==== could drop from an influx of lower class residents.","The phenomenon of tipping occurs when a significant amount of people leave a neighborhood in a very short period of time because a group of people different from themselves has moved in. The models in Schelling (1971) gave a formal presentation of tipping in the context of white and black residential segregation. This has spawned many follow ups, both theoretical (Anas, 1980, Sethi, Somanathan, 2004, Pancs, Vriend, 2007, Zhang, 2011), and empirical (Galster, 1990a, Galster, 1990b, Clark, 1991, Clark, 1993, Bruch, Mare, 2006, Card, Mas, Rothstein, 2008b, Card, Mas, Rothstein, 2008a, Easterly, 2009, Banzhaf, Walsh, 2013) that have continued to study tipping behavior by race. Racial composition, however, is but one of many signals that people take into consideration when they choose a neighborhood to live in. A neighborhood ‘tipping’ could just as easily describe neighborhoods shifting from being been mostly Irish to Italian or Polish in the late 1800s and early 1900s as it could ‘white flight’ from the 1930s onwards. Those were neighborhood changes along non-racial variables such as language, social mores, occupations, and the built environment. It is clear from such examples that neighborhood change is multifaceted, but there are still very few studies that look for tipping along demographic dimensions beyond race.==== The goal of this study is to address this gap in the literature by examining the evidence for lower income residents inducing tipping behavior amongst upper income residents.====If the tipping theory applies to income groups, we would expect to see some critical share of lower income residents that, when passed, will lead to upper income residents leaving en masse. To test for this, I adapt the discontinuous regression methods used in Card et al. (2008b), Dorn (2008), Pan (2015), and Coulson and Wommer (2019) and use data from the Neighborhood Change Database (NCDB)–U.S Census Data from 1970 to 2010 that has been normalized to 2010 census tracts to avoid the problem of changing boundaries. The methods split the data into two samples and use two-thirds to estimate the tipping point, and the remaining third to estimate the response of the upper income group at the tipping point. I classify people as upper or lower class based on whether or not they are above the 10th percentile in their city’s income distribution.==== This process uncovers compelling evidence of tipping by income divisions.==== Tipping points range from 7 to 12% and have been rising as time goes forward. If the proportion of people in the neighborhood who are below the 10th percentile of income in their city exceeds the tipping point, the corresponding response is estimated to be a 5–14% decrease in residents who are above the 10th percentile.====To investigate the driving forces behind the tipping effects, I add interaction terms to the main regression that allow the tipping effect to vary according to different characteristics of a neighborhood. Here it is found that neighborhoods where a higher proportion of families have school aged children tip more. This is also true for neighborhoods where a higher share of people are homeowners, though the effect is not as strong. In fact, a neighborhood with no families with school aged children, and no homeowners would not be expected to tip at all. This suggests that income tipping is primarily driven by a fear that the provision of public goods in the neighborhood will drop when lower income people move in or that house values will drop. Both of these would seem to make sense a priori. There are many anecdotal examples of residents objecting to low income public housing in their neighborhoods based on the belief that the influx of poor residents will lead to drops in house values, increases in crime, and decreases in the quality of local schools.====There are a number of concerns with the baseline results that are addressed through a series of robustness checks. First, one might be concerned that these are simply racial tipping points misinterpreted as income tipping points, since the two are highly correlated. This is addressed both by conditioning on changes in the racial composition of the neighborhood, and by checking to see if there is a response in the white population at the tipping point holding income changes constant. Both show that the tipping points found are distinct from racial tipping points.====Second, one might worry that a person’s income percentile, unlike their race, is not stable across their lifetime. In general, this would be expected to understate results. Since a person’s income percentile will generally move upwards throughout their lifetime, if no one moved in or out of a neighborhood, we would expect an increase in the proportion of residents who are upper class (Bolster et al., 2007). This could mean the baseline results are understating the true effect. In addition, we would expect retirement to cause a persons income percentile to drop sharply between censuses. To solve these issues, I replace ordinary income with permanent income. This projects income based on educational attainment, a statistic that generally remains unchanged beyond age 30, and does not decrease in retirement. This does not substantially alter the results.====Another objection to reapplying the tipping model to income might be that people are not actually able to tell how rich or poor their neighbors are. To address this, my third robustness check uses another permanent income regression, this time projecting income from easily observable characteristics of the neighborhood such as the physical characteristics of houses, number of cars owned, and age, etc. Running the analysis using the predicted values from this permanent income regression yields results that are consistent with the baseline. This is not surprising, given that average neighborhood income is publicly available information.====An important note on the results is that they are reduced form estimates, and while we can rule out two-way causality, we cannot infer from them that it is reactions to a neighbors income that are creating the effect. That is, I am not able to say for certain across which dimension tipping occurs. It is extremely difficult to identify this, and to my knowledge no study has been able to do so. This is because people who have different incomes typically differ in many other characteristics. A rich person tends to also be better educated, own a nice car, spend more money renovating their house, etc. Thus, any source of exogenous variation that changes the share of poor people in a neighborhood will likely change other factors, including unobservable ones.====The study is strongly motivated by the rising role of income as a sociodemographic divider. It is well documented that income inequality has increased in the United States over the last 40 years (Saez, 2013), and that much of the divergence of income has been within cities (Watson, 2009, Fischer, Stockmayer, Stiles, Hout, 2004), with neighborhoods becoming more segregated by income over time (Fry and Taylor, 2012). These differences in income have contributed to rising inequality in education attainment (Kornrich, Furstenberg, 2013, Bailey, Dynarski, 2011). This has resulted in a self-perpetuating process where the rise in education feeds back into income (Corak, 2013) leading to ever growing inequality.====This divergence in outcomes has inspired to some to argue that income divisions (as a proxy for ‘class’), as well as racial divisions, are playing an increasingly important role in entrenching people into their respective social groups.====Furthermore, the spatial distribution of income has not been constant over this period. Rosenthal (2008) finds that the location of relatively ’poor’ and ’rich’ neighborhoods within a city changed frequently in the period between 1950 and 2000. Amongst the 35 cities in his sample, Rosenthal finds that only 43% of upper-income neighborhoods maintained their 1950 status in 2000.====This brings us back to the question of tipping. As mentioned, rigorous empirical work on tipping has, up until now, nearly exclusively considered race. The original Schelling models used racial divisions inspired by the inflow of blacks into urban centers during the 1950s and 1960s. Schelling made clear that the model can be easily expanded to other characteristics.==== However, in light of the growing importance of income as a social divider, and the frequency of changes in neighborhood economic status it seems appropriate that tests of the model should be extended to income.====The rest of the paper proceeds as follows; Section 2 reviews the literature on tipping models, Section 3 describes the data source and the transformations performed, Section 4 details the estimation strategy, Section 5 presents the results in 3 subsections that detail the baseline results, robustness checks, and additional regressions with interaction effects, respectively.

We analyze the variation of the self-reported valuation bias over the distribution of dwelling sale prices, using a dataset of observations from a Household Expenditure Survey merged with the national sample of housing sale transactions by census tract. We find that self-reported estimates of dwelling values are, on average, 20% higher than the mean market prices of houses in the corresponding census tracts. Estimates reported by people who occupy dwellings in the lowest eight deciles of the price distribution are upward-biased, whereas those who live in the most expensive dwellings more typically understate the value of their homes. The self-reported valuation bias is systematically associated with owner's traits and with dwelling and neighborhood characteristics. Misspecification might be another potential explanation for that bias. The frequency of dwelling sales in the respondent's tract was found to have an effect on the self-reported valuation bias.","The value of a dwelling in the free market may be estimated in several ways: by a professional appraiser, by setting a price in a sale transaction, and according the property's owner subjective judgment. Among these methods, sale price in the free market is considered the best estimate of a dwelling's value, consistent with the conventional definition of the American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers (1988). In economic research, however, the use of subjective valuations by property owners is more common, for two main reasons. First, information about sale prices usually originates in reportage to the tax authorities, which usually fails to provide researchers with data that offer sufficiently large samples at an appropriate spatial resolution to meet research needs. Second, many surveys report the subjective valuation of a dwelling together with characteristics of the property and its owner—information that is seldom available in the sale-transaction data that are reported to the tax authorities. Obviously, then, owner valuations elicited by surveys are very useful provided that they furnish an unbiased estimate of the prices of dwellings if the dwellings were sold that very day. Hence the immense importance of a study that tests the extent of accuracy of subjective dwelling valuations, the differences between these valuations and appraiser’ estimates and sale prices, and the factors associated with these differences.====The accuracy of subjective dwelling valuations has been researched for nearly five decades, mainly on the basis of U.S. data. Although the estimates of the bias range from ==== 2% to 16%, it would be fair to sum up by saying that in most scholars’ opinion, dwelling owners tend to overvalue their properties by about 5%.====This study augments the research literature on this topic in several ways. First, we focus on investigating the accuracy of subjective valuations across a distribution of dwelling values. Research thus far has not addressed the issue of whether the valuations of inexpensive and expensive properties are biased in the same direction and whether the bias is homoscedastic. Second, the study is based on a unique database that covers more than a decade and combines dwelling valuations culled from a large national survey with data on sale transactions at the level of census tract. Third, along with the dwelling and owner indicators that the survey provides, we augment the analysis with demographic and socioeconomic indicators of the population of the census tract and the spatial environment of the dwelling. This allows us to see whether misspecification may be a potential explanation for dwelling valuation bias. Fourth, given information about the change in transaction prices in a census tract over time, we investigate the correlation between the dwelling valuations reported in the survey and dwelling prices in the tract within a one-year window before and after the date of participation in the survey. Thus, we determine how long it takes for homeowner valuations to internalize “news” about housing prices in the neighborhood.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents theoretical background on the accuracy of subjective dwelling valuations.

This study assesses one of the Federal Government's rationales for its involvement in the homeownership market; that homeownership, particularly for low-income households, is the best way to accumulate wealth. If there is no evidence to support this claim, it may well be the case that low-income Americans have a better chance of securing the American dream without purchasing a home, especially before they are financially and psychologically prepared (Olsen and Zabel 2015). On the other hand, if the evidence is supportive of wealth accumulation, this can provide motivation for subsidies to promote homeownership and hence make it more affordable for low-income households. The goal of this paper is to provide credible evidence about the relationship between homeownership and wealth accumulation for low-income households.====There are several reasons why federal involvement in the homeownership market can be justified on efficiency grounds. First, homeownership generates positive externalities such as increased exterior maintenance, household and neighborhood stability, greater civic engagement, and increases in social capital (Green and White 1997, DiPasquale and Glaeser 1999, Coulson, Imai and Hwang 2003, Dietz and Haurin 2003, Hilber and Mayer 2009, Coulson and Li 2013). It has been argued that neighborhood improvement that results from homeownership is particularly valuable in low-income areas (Shlay 2006). There is also evidence that homeownership benefits children which potential buyers do not fully internalize when deciding whether to purchase a home (Green and White 1997, Boehm and Schlottmann 1999, Harkness and Newman 2003).====Second, information asymmetries between borrowers and lenders can result in the classic lemons problem where only risky borrowers buy loans at interest rates that are too high for low-risk borrowers to participate in the market. This can justify the existence of government agencies that promote liquidity in the primary mortgage market. This is particularly relevant during economic crises such as the Great Depression and the Great Recession. A second source of information asymmetry exists between mortgage originators and purchasers in the secondary market where originators have more knowledge about the quality of loans than the purchasers and have an incentive to sell the riskier loans. This can result in illiquidity in the secondary market. Government involvement can promote liquidity in the secondary market, particularly during times of great financial distress (Glaeser 2010).====Third, discrimination in the mortgage market can restrict creditworthy borrowers from receiving credit because of unrelated characteristics such as race. As noted by Avery et al. (2005), extending credit to these underserved groups should result in an increase in profitable lending.====Finally, for homeowners, house price appreciation is an important means for increasing household wealth since it is likely to be their largest asset. This can be particularly true for low-income households. Since households do not fully internalize the value of homeownership as a means for asset accumulation, there is a role for government involvement. In fact, the Federal Government has long used this reason as a means for promoting low-income homeownership (Boehm and Schlottmann 2008). Hence, evaluating this claim is the primary goal of our paper, as it provides an impetus for the government to subsidize homeownership, making it more affordable for low-income households.====There is a diverse literature on the topic of wealth accumulation through owning a home. There are studies that use panel data to determine wealth accumulation from additional years of homeownership and studies that approach the issue from a financial perspective by simulating the investment portfolios of homeowners and renters. Most recently, on the former side of the literature, Newman and Holupka (2016) conclude that for new homeowners in the 2001–2009 period, homeownership does not increase wealth in the long-term, particularly for black households. On the latter side of the literature, Beracha and Johnson (2012) find that renting is preferred to owning over 70% of the time to achieve wealth accumulation.====The conclusions of these studies, and ones like them, face several major limitations. First, low-income households face a higher risk of financial instability, meaning they are more likely to fail to pay back their mortgages and face foreclosure (Santiago et al., 2010). Not accounting for the broader ways in which the financial markets treat low-income households may impact results.====Second, the results typically track wealth accumulation during a relatively short time period, and thus a restricted portion of the housing cycle, and hence are not necessarily generalizable. This can hamper future policy implications when housing conditions will be different.====A third problem with the previous literature is the existence of selection bias. Groups of homeowners are compared to groups of renters, and the differences between these groups are not controlled for. In particular, a down payment is often necessary to purchase a home which means that, all else equal, owners are likely to be better savers and hence are likely to accumulate more wealth than renters, regardless of tenure status.====Our addition to this literature is threefold. First, we use the 1984–2013 waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) to establish a household-level fixed effects difference-in-difference framework to focus on how wealth changes for households that change their housing tenure status, an approach that controls for selection bias. We distinguish impacts by initial income level, so we can identify wealth accumulation for low-income households. We find that, on average, low-income homeowners can accumulate significant wealth holdings but that this is not guaranteed.====Second, our sample covers a period of relative stability as well as the recent housing crisis and recovery. Researchers have claimed that the timing of home purchase is important for asset accumulation. We find that timing does mater, but only in a broader sense. Those households that purchased and owned their homes during a period of relative stability (1980′s and 1990′s) saw significant gains in wealth whereas those households that purchased and owned their houses during a period of relative volatility (2000′s and early 2010′s) experienced little, if any, gain in wealth. And these gains (or lack thereof) depended much more on the broad period of purchase (late 1980′s and 1990′s versus 2000′s) than on the exact date within these periods.====Third, we offer a critical appraisal of the Federal Government's claim that homeownership is an important means for low-income households to accumulate wealth. Our findings suggest that this claim is only true when the housing market is relatively stable but not when it displays significant volatility. Since the later scenario covered an unprecedented national downturn in the housing market and the former situation is more likely to characterize the housing market going forward, we believe that the Federal Government should continue to support homeownership as a means of wealth accumulation for low-income households. Still, it needs to be made clear that this depends on the state of the housing market and there are times when owning a home can be worse for wealth accumulation than renting.====One reason that low-income homeowners were unable to accumulate wealth in the last ten years was their high foreclosure rate. Hence, if the Federal Government wants to support its claim, we recommend that it should assist low-income homeowners in staying in their homes.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a summary of the existing literature on homeownership and wealth accumulation. Section 3 presents details about the sample we use from the PSID.

The Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) is the federally-insured version of this product and comprises the largest share of the market. HECMs are non-recourse, and allow older adults to borrow against their home with no interest or repayment due until the owner passes away, sells the home, or moves out. Subject to limitations more fully discussed later in the paper, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insurance protects creditors when the mortgage balance exceeds the value of the home.==== Consistent with its efforts to provide liquidity to the mortgage market, Fannie Mae was the primary investor in this mortgage type for nearly two decades.====While reverse mortgages were first discussed in Congress in 1969, the product did not gain significant traction until the 1980s. The “Home Equity Conversion Mortgage Demonstration” was mandated by Congress in 1987 and the first FHA-insured mortgage was issued in 1989 (Guerin, 2012). Fannie Mae soon thereafter began to acquire HECMs and hold them in its portfolio (Fout and Yao, 2013). These activities facilitated a market that private lenders had not been able to develop on their own.==== Over the period 1993–2010, Fannie Mae acquired a total of 492,465 HECMs, or more than 75% of the total HECM endorsements during this time.==== Approximately 181,000 remain outstanding as of 2017. Ginnie Mae created a securitized HECM product (HECM mortgage-backed securities, or HMBS) in 2007 and, as market acceptance grew, Fannie Mae discontinued new HECM acquisitions in 2010 (Fout and Yao, 2013).====As is well known, many older adults are inadequately prepared for retirement but do have significant wealth in housing (Begley and Chan, 2018). Accordingly, mechanisms that help homeowners access housing wealth while aging in place are expected to increase in the coming years (U.S. Census Bureau 2014, Carter et al., 2017).==== However, recent spikes in reverse mortgage defaults==== and foreclosures increased concern about the product's viability for all stakeholders: borrowers, lenders, insurers, and investors. In contrast to the forward mortgage market, the reverse mortgage market is not as well-understood; both because reverse mortgages are relatively new and complex instruments, and because there is limited publicly-available reverse mortgage loan performance data.====As the largest purchaser of HECMs for two decades, Fannie Mae played an important role providing liquidity to HECM lenders. Additionally, Fannie Mae's portfolio went through a range of macroeconomic experiences, allowing for a meaningful look at HECM performance over time. We use rich data on loan performance and borrower characteristics, including credit data, to provide new insights into the reverse mortgage product. We model reverse mortgage terminations and other resolution outcomes. We build on prior literature documenting HECM borrower behavior, particularly a recent paper by Moulton et al. (2015) that explores determinants of HECM defaults and the potential benefits of program changes on outcomes. Our contribution is to more effectively model economic losses and loan performance over the life of the loan with a more complete view of termination outcomes, loan severities, and credit data.====Understanding all these relationships is essential to price both the product and its insurance, and our analysis shows that credit scores are important predictors of initial draw amounts, termination, and mortgage payoff. We also find that credit delinquencies, high credit utilization rates, and unpaid debt in collection are predictive of draws and likelihood of termination; however, credit information is not as strong a predictor of resolution outcomes or loss severity for loans in adverse termination stages. The exception being REO loans, where lower credit score borrowers have markedly higher severities than higher credit score borrowers.====The balance of the paper proceeds as follows. In the next section, we provide more detailed information on the HECM program, including some of its unique terminology, and describe how it has evolved over time. We then survey the existing research and identify open questions that our work helps address. In the fourth section, we describe the data. In the fifth section, we present a series of models used to predict initial draw amounts and subsequent loan performance.

In contrast, the ==== of homeowners is reflected in cohorts’ annual net increments of homeownership and provides a better measure of current demand. These cohort gains in homeownership rates turned sharply upward after 2012, four years earlier than age group rates finally stabilized. Increases in cohort rates of homeownership are shown to be much more predictive of aggregate home buying in a given period than the slowly-changing, age group (stock) rates.====A second set of lags is behavioral and pertains to current inflows of homeowners that are linked to the lagged marital, income and market histories unique to each cohort, subject also to the current market forces impacting all cohorts. These effects are tested for a series of 2-year birth cohorts under age 40 observed from 2010 to 2016 in the 100 largest U.S. metros, using the large data samples from the American Community Survey. Findings are that homeownership gains are boosted by substantial lagged effects from marriage and income gains that occurred up to four years earlier, and also by incentives for home purchase from past price increases, offset by current ==== obstacles.====Greater positive homeownership inflows by cohorts indicate stronger young-adult preferences for owner-occupancy than previously inferred from trends in the accumulated age group rates. Although Millennial homeownership rates remain lower than those of previous generations, gaps are closing, and lagged effects from delayed marriage and recent income growth lay a foundation for continued ownership gains to follow.","The fate of Millennials in the housing market has drawn widespread attention, and for good reason. Young-adult housing consumption dropped dramatically during the recession, with indicators like headship rates and homeownership rates falling sharply in the age groups now occupied by the large Millennial generation (born 1980–1999).==== Despite the return of young-adult unemployment to pre-recession levels and strong real income gains for young households, as late as 2017 the homeownership rate for households under age 35 had not recovered any of its previous losses following steep declines from 2006 through 2015.====This sustained decline in the homeownership rate of the young age group is cited frequently in the press, professional and academic studies and some policy discussions, as a sign of lost desire for homeownership among young Americans. Yet, at the same time, other evidence of market activity shows a 37.3 percent upturn in young-adult home buying between 2011 and 2016, despite the declining homeownership rates.==== This contradiction in measurements is addressed early in the paper. In fact, cohort analysis of home buying provides the resolution to this seeming paradox.====The first task of this paper is to demonstrate and explain the large differences between age group and cohort measurements of homeownership trends during the recession and recovery years. The familiar age group rates of homeownership are an accumulation of past homebuying, conceived here as representing the ==== of homeownership held by an age group. This stock is contrasted to the net ==== into homeownership each year as specific cohorts grow older. The Millennials represent large cohorts whose depressed achievements during recession years have persisted in the accumulated age group rates, while quickly correcting in the annual flows. The divergence of age group and cohort measurements of homeownership change is found to be greatest after 2012, when age group homeownership rates continued to decline or merely stabilized, while at the same time young cohorts were accelerating their flows into homeownership. The current age-group rates of homeownership are an accumulated, lagged product of past homebuying flows, which were depressed during recession years. Thus the age group trends structurally lag the current cohort gains by four years or more. Over time, the increased cohort gains will accumulate into higher age group rates, but the several years of steep declines during the recession have created a substantial deficit to reverse.====Second, we offer explicit tests of the degree to which cohort flows into homeownership are accelerating post-2012, and in some cases even eclipsing gains achieved pre-recession. Cohorts younger than 26 have been slower to rebound than those who are older. We also test whether age group trends or cohort trends are a better predictor of aggregate homebuying. Comparisons between 2006 and 2016 show broad similarity between the two formulations until the onset of housing recovery in 2012, after which the cohort homeownership rate trends are much more predictive of rising home buying than are the age group trends.====The third major contribution of the paper is to examine more deeply the cohort structure of homebuying demand in the 100 largest metropolitan areas, estimating the lagged effects of past cohort experience and the effects of current market conditions that could impede or promote the pace of homeownership acquisition. The lagged factors could impact home buying preparations over several years’ time, not just in the current year. A key advantage of the cohort formulation of demand is the ability to link past aggregate histories to current rates of homebuying, something not possible with age groups that are disconnected from their cohort histories.====Research questions that follow include how much the progression into marriage or childbearing, as the young cohorts grow older, is associated with greater home buying of these cohorts. These factors are well recognized as prime demographic motivators for homeownership (Green, 1996, Gabriel and Rosenthal, 2015, Haurin et al., 1996) but both marriage and childbearing have been substantially delayed among Millennials. Another key question is how much the pace of recovery is impeded by local house price increases relative to incomes, including not only in the current observation period but also in prior years.====The value of the cohort as the unit of observation is that the cohort provides a means for representing in aggregate the longitudinal process of demand formation, which can be observed and modeled for many cohorts’ careers in many different market areas. The theory advanced is that housing demand is expressed at a moment in time but potential demand is built up over a number of years as families form and incomes grow along with progressing employment careers. Homeownership accumulates through legacy effects of past home buying and current incentives or impediments.====The analysis takes full advantage of the American Community Survey (ACS), which is conducted annually by the Census Bureau and has provided large samples for individual metropolitan areas since 2006. This covers the unique period of the Great Recession and its recovery years. Although cohort methods have been used in housing research for many years (Pitkin and Masnick, 1980, Pitkin and Myers, 1994, Myers et al., 2005, Coulson and Dalton, 2010), cohort analyses were implemented most often in decadal units of time using decennial census data. As such, cohort applications were often restricted to national studies with cohort change measured over intervals that were too long to pick up on short-term changes in demand within business and housing cycles or over brief segments of the life cycle. The ACS now presents new opportunities, not only for national analysis but also for comparisons of metropolitan areas. The lagged structure implemented in our models directly taps into the legacy effects carried forward by cohorts over the short time frame of a business cycle. This is not possible when using age groups because their homeownership is disconnected from their histories when they were younger.====The paper begins with a brief review of theories about the use of age groups and cohorts in the literature on housing demand. As part of this background we describe differences between the age-group time series of homeownership rates and the cohort transition trends constructed from the same data at the national level. The puzzle has been that market activity has increased by more than 30 percent in the last 5 years, even while age group rates declined. To help explain this puzzle, we next use overall age changes and cohort changes, alternatively, to “predict” market activity in the 100 largest metropolitan areas in different years. After 2012 the cohort approach offered much better explanatory power than the age group method.====We next set up an analysis of 3000 segments of cohort change compiled from the 100 metros in three 2-year time intervals post 2010 and observed across ten 2-year age spans. Hypotheses are developed for testing within this analytical framework and the data are organized in a suitable fashion. In the cohort framework we are able to specify lagged effects within the history of each cohort and estimate the contributions of those past and current forces for building demand for homeownership. We then discuss the implications of the findings for economic theory about homeownership, as well as the implications for recovering Millennial home buying demand after the Great Recession.",Cohort insights into recovery of Millennial homeownership after the Great Recession,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137718300445,29 January 2019,2019,Research Article,131.0

This literature highlights the correlation between two prominent trends affecting the household balance sheets of many developed economies over the past three decades: the growth of income inequality and the growth of household debt levels (Fig. 1). The saving rates of American low and middle-income consumers, in particular, began declining as soon as inequality started to soar, in the middle 1980s (Rajan, 2010). This has led some authors to argue that poor and middle-income American households borrowed beyond their own capacity to repay in order to sustain consumption levels despite stagnating real incomes, generating fragility in the financial system (Rajan, 2010, Kumhof, Ranciére, Winant).====This paper attempts to ascertain whether rising income inequality can be considered a direct driver of the consumption choices of low and middle-income American consumers in the run-up to the 2007–2008 financial crisis. I focus in particular on testing the relative income hypothesis (Duesenberry, 1949), which received substantial attention in the public discourse as well as in academic circles (Frank, Levine, Dijk, 2014, Bertrand, Morse, 2016, Carr, Jayadev, 2015, Giorgi, Frederiksen, Pistaferri, 2016). This theory suggests that an increase in income at the top of the distribution could directly drive consumption choices at the bottom. This is because if individuals are concerned with status, rising income inequality within a given social group might lead its relatively poorer members to consume a larger proportion of their resources, due to a desire to emulate the consumption levels of richer individuals. Low and middle-income consumers might therefore accumulate debt despite no real income change. Recent literature finds empirical support for this hypothesis, suggesting that inequality might have been a direct driver of poorer households’ consumption and saving decisions ahead of the crisis (Bertrand, Morse, 2016, Carr, Jayadev, 2015).====I use the Consumer Expenditure Survey and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to study how the consumption and borrowing behaviour of low and middle-income American households responds to changes in top incomes in their area of residence. My methodology follows closely the choice of data and the empirical strategy used in previous literature on the topic, particularly (Bertrand and Morse, 2016). I rely on the variation over time in the average annual incomes of the top two deciles of the state/year income distribution to analyze how the consumption and debt levels of all other households respond to changes in the income levels of richer households living in the same state at the same point in time, after controlling for own income and for a set of household-level covariates which affect consumption. The coefficient associated with average top incomes, holding these covariates constant, effectively measures whether when rich households are getting richer, poorer households are spending a larger fraction of their income, or getting more in debt. This could indeed be the case if people were concerned with status, since they might desire to imitate the behaviour (consumption) of the richer households that they are more likely to observe: those geographically closer to them.====My contribution is to provide evidence that challenges the notion that relative income concerns were a ==== driver of consumption and saving decisions of US households in the decade ahead of the financial crisis. Instead, my results indicate that if relative income considerations were at play during this time frame, they were mediated by homeownership and by rising values of owner-occupied houses, which were positively correlated with the growth in income inequality within geographical areas. The consumption emulation mechanism in this time frame is ==== from the cost, wealth and collateral effects granted by homeownership and by the rising prices of residential housing.====To support this intuition, I rely on three main results. First, I provide evidence that during the decade preceding the 2007 financial crisis there is ==== between top incomes and the consumption levels of poor and middle-income American households, despite this being the time frame in which top income share rose to the highest level since the 1930s (Piketty and Saez, 2014) and the household debt-to-GDP ratio increased by almost forty percentage points (Fig. 2). However, one particular consumer category reacts more than others to changes in top incomes in the local area of residence: poor and middle income ====. Homeowners ==== with similar demographic characteristics when top incomes in their state increase. Second, owners and renters display entirely different debt accumulation patterns in response to an increase in top incomes, with owners significantly increasing their debt-to-income ratios (2.1% for each 10% increase in top incomes) while renters’ leverage declines. The difference in debt accumulation is entirely driven by mortgage debt, since consumer debt is not affected by changes in inequality. This result does not seem to be explained by a reduction in the cost of loans, since the interest rates charged on mortgages offered to borrowers with similar characteristics are not significantly affected by changes in top incomes at the state level. Third, I find that the growth in top incomes was positively correlated with the growth in the value of the owner-occupied housing stock, but not with a similar growth in rental costs or income.====These results suggest that a simple consumption emulation mechanism (Bertrand, Morse, 2016, Carr, Jayadev, 2015) is in itself insufficient to explain the correlation between the growth in income inequality and in household borrowing ahead of the 2008 financial crisis. In the status-emulation scenario, homeownership does not play a role in the consumption response to changing top incomes, and expenditure or borrowing should shift similarly between owners and renters who are comparable with respect to a set of observable characteristics, including own income, and subject to the same change in inequality. Instead, the fact that renters are unaffected by changes in top incomes, while homeowners’ expenditure and borrowing rates shift in a positive direction, combined with the evidence that the growth in house values are correlated with the growth in measures of income inequality suggest that the role of house prices (and associated wealth effects) might be an important missing link in the correlation between income inequality and household debt accumulation.====House prices might affect consumption and saving rates of homeowners via two channels: through higher house prices at the time of purchase and through the wealth and collateral effect experienced by ==== homeowners, which could fuel non-shelter expenditure. My results indicate that the housing cost channel is predominant over this time frame, since homeowners’ housing consumption responds more than non-housing consumption to changes in top incomes. It is important to emphasize that these results do not necessarily discount the psychological driver at the heart of the relative income hypothesis: conditional on homeownership, the choice to purchase a larger house and have therefore higher housing expenditure might well be motivated by a form of consumption emulation as a response to higher inequality in one’s peer group, particularly so since housing is a positional good (Bellet, 2017). Furthermore, due to the potential existence of omitted variables correlated simultaneously with the distribution of income, consumption and house prices I refrain from a causal interpretation of these results. Nevertheless, this evidence suggests a role for house prices as a potential alternative explanation for the link between inequality and household debt levels. At the very least, the evidence indicates that homeownership has been a necessary precondition for a form of conspicuous consumption to even take place, during this time frame.====The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the relevant literature. Section 3 describes the household surveys, and presents a discussion of methodology.

Past research has cited the importance of down payment constraints, but often has not included data on parental ","The financial crisis of 2008–2009 and subsequent recovery have reshaped the U.S. housing market, as homeownership has plummeted to its 50-year low and lending standards have dramatically tightened (CoreLogic 2017; Goodman, 2017). The effects of changing economic conditions on homeownership have been magnified among young households, who are more likely to be liquidity constrained (Jappelli, 1990). Survey evidence from the 2014 Fannie Mae National Housing Survey suggests that 50% of younger renters identified down payment and closing costs as their greatest obstacle to obtaining a mortgage for the purpose of purchasing a home (Fannie Mae, 2014). Larrimore et al., (2016) also found in the 2014 Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED) that more than half of young renters believe that they cannot afford a down payment and that student loans and credit card debt will increase the time it takes to save enough to own a home.====Intergenerational financial transfers can relax down payment constraints for young adults by reducing the number of years to save, increasing the total amount of funds available, or both (Cox, 1990, Engelhardt and Mayer, 1998, Guiso and Jappelli, 2002). Recent surveys point to first-time home buyers’ reliance on financial gifts, in particular. The National Association of Realtors (NAR) reports that 14% of all buyers in the last year, including 26% of first-time home buyers, received a gift to help with their down payment.==== NAR reports that gifts were much more common among buyers age 34 and younger (25%) than those ages 35 to 49 (15%), and far less common among those 50 and older. Similarly, the Federal Reserve Board (2015) reports in its 2014 SHED that 18.1% of respondents of any age who purchased a home between 2011 and 2014 said they made use of a “loan or gift from family or friends,” among multiple options, for purposes of a down payment.====Although the observed patterns are consistent with theory, survey evidence is not sufficient to determine whether financial assistance from parents directly affects home buying. It should be recognized that the universe for calculating the share with assistance in both NAR and SHED is the set of home buyers, not the complete universe of people or households observed prior to a purchase. Moreover, the effect of assistance is not estimated net of other related factors. Financial assistance may reflect the fact that adult children with high resource parents are more likely to become homeowners because of their own high economic status, or that of their parents, and due to other unobserved factors associated with parents’ high income and wealth that are related to homeownership (Hurd et al., 2011; Schoeni and Ross, 2005, Zissimopoulos and Smith, 2011).====In this study, we use the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) and Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), two nationally representative panel data sets with rich covariates on parents and their adult children, to quantify the impact of a financial transfer from a parent to an adult child non-homeowner on the likelihood that the child becomes a homeowner. Each data set has distinct advantages. The HRS has more accurate transfer data, as McGarry and Schoeni (1995) find that the PSID underreports financial transfers, while the PSID includes more recent data and information on a child's wealth that is not available in the HRS. We estimate reduced form models to measure the association between receiving a transfer in the past two years and becoming a homeowner over the same period. The empirical models include a rich set of demographic, social, and economic characteristics of the adult child and the parents, which enables us to estimate the association between receiving a transfer in the transition to homeownership as independent of these confounding effects.====We find evidence of intergenerational transmission of homeownership and wealth through direct financial assistance. Evidence in the HRS suggests that the probability of transitioning to homeownership increases by 3.1 percentage points, or 15.1%, if a child receives a substantial transfer of over $5000. This result is confirmed by data from the PSID that also reveals a stronger association during the Great Recession. During the recessionary period, children in the PSID sample that received a transfer of over $5000 have 7.3 percentage points higher likelihood of becoming a homeowner.",The role of parental financial assistance in the transition to homeownership by young adults,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137717302358,7 August 2018,2018,Research Article,134.0

Historically, houses in many developed economies are financed through both equity, mostly in the form of savings, and debt. In recent decades, however, homeowners tend to finance their property with lower equity levels (Badarinza et al., 2016). Simultaneously, homeownership rates increased in many developed countries. Household characteristics such as age, household structure, income and education only partly explain rising homeownership rates, leaving a potential role for public policy in explaining these developments. Both the US and European countries tried to promote homeownership by reducing mortgage payments through Mortgage Interest Deductions (MID). The discount on interest rates due to MID ranged from 1.6 percentage points in the Netherlands, over 1 percentage point in the US to 0.2 percentage points in Italy (Andrews et al., 2011).====In the US the major policy concern since the Great Depression has been to make housing affordable. Policies aimed at the promotion of homeownership invoked a growth of homeownership rates between 1940 and 1960 by nearly 20 percentage points, from 44–62%. Homeownership rates peaked in 2005 at 69.1% and decreased to 63.5% in 2016 (Acolin et al., 2016, The U.S. Census Bureau 2016). In particular, institutions such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and Fannie Mae contributed to this expansion (Acolin et al., 2016). Moreover, government mortgage subsidies are one of the main drivers of the increase in homeownership in the US after World War II (Fetter, 2013). While the homeownership rates remained stable until the 1990s, they began to rise again until the peak in 2006. Barakova et al. (2014) provide evidence that credit quality and income became less important to become a homeowner in the period before the peak. In the period after 2006 housing values plummeted all across the US. The decline in underlying collateral drove about one third of US households into negative home equity (Acolin et al., 2016).====Similar developments played out in various European countries. In particular, Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Spain experienced large run-ups in house prices between 2000/07. As in the US, the housing boom was mostly driven by easing mortgage terms, accompanied by debt accumulation (IMF, 2015). The booms ended around the 2008/09 global financial crisis. As a consequence real house prices in all four countries decreased by 25% or more, driving many households into negative home equity. At the deepest point over a third of the Dutch households were faced with a mortgage which was higher than the value of the house, which serves as collateral.====Having substantial amounts of households with negative home equity raises concerns both on the private (micro) level as well as on the social level. On the micro level, falling values of housing equity can put severe constraints on the budget of households (Andrews et al., 2011). This makes it more difficult for households to absorb income shocks, save for retirement or maintain their level of consumption (Mian et al., 2013, Kaplan et al., 2016). Next to this, negative home equity can also affect household mobility, either by discouraging or restricting households from moving. On the one hand, households may be reluctant to move because they do not want to realize a loss on their house (Engelhardt, 2003). On the other hand, households are unable to move because they cannot refinance their current mortgage or provide a down payment on the new property (Stein, 1995).====In the event of negative home equity becoming a widespread phenomenon, it can have a range of macroeconomic effects. First, when falling house prices push homeowners into negative equity, the aforementioned mechanisms can imply higher levels of saving and lower levels of aggregate consumption for the whole economy (Piazzesi and Schneider, 2016). Second, households with negative home equity might be unable to adjust to changing labor market conditions if they cannot move to the region where their labor force is needed (see for instance Oswald, 1996, Oswald, 1997, Oswald, 1999, Blanchflower and Oswald, 2013). This leads to a reduction in the supply capacity of the economy by increasing structural unemployment and reducing productivity (Henley, 1998). Rigid labor supply due to geographical immobility in turn might reinforce the effects of an economic downturn (Sterk, 2015).====In this paper we empirically investigate the effect of negative home equity on household residential mobility. We construct a unique panel data set from various administrative data sets from Statistics Netherlands. We combine data on residential household mobility, outstanding mortgage debt, the underlying property value, and many household characteristics for the period from 2006 until 2012. This allows us to calculate households’ home equity levels by making use of loan-to-value-ratios (LTVs) and follow homeowners over time.====The empirical strategy in this paper is twofold. In the first step, we follow the standard approach in the literature (see for instance Ferreira et al., 2010, Andersson and Mayock, 2014). We compare household mobility between two groups: households having negative and positive home equity, respectively. We employ panel regressions to estimate the effect of high LTVs on residential mobility. To control for unobserved heterogeneity, we include postal code area - year fixed effects. However, this standard approach from the literature has two caveats. First, it does not account for (potential) self-selection of homeowners into high levels of LTV. Second, it ignores potential unobserved household characteristics such as education and financial literacy that influence choices for certain levels of LTV and, hence, mobility.====Our second empirical strategy addresses the aforementioned drawbacks. We exploit the large and unanticipated decline in house prices in the period 2008–2011 to identify households who plunged into negative home equity involuntarily. In other words, in the absence of the house-price decline these homeowners would have remained with positive home equity. We exploit the panel structure of our data and compare the mobility of households who plunged into negative home equity to the mobility of households who upheld positive home equity after 2008. In all our regressions we employ two set of fixed effects. To control for potential unobserved characteristics on the household level we use household fixed effects. In order to control for time varying local economic conditions, we also include local labor market fixed effects interacted with the year.====All our estimations show that negative home equity is associated with a decline of household residential mobility. The estimates in the standard approach reveal a 26%–32% decline in the annual probability of moving if households have negative home equity. These estimates decrease in size if we employ the second empirical strategy. When we estimate the effects of negative home equity for those households who fell into negative equity due to the unexpected decline in house prices after 2008, we find a decrease of the annual probability to move of 21%. The effect sizes are at the lower range of magnitude compared to estimates in the literature. Ferreira et al. (2010) found a decrease on the probability to move residence of about 50%. In contrast, Bricker and Bucks (2016) find a ==== effect of negative home equity on residential mobility. Our results remain robust and stable to various specifications and robustness checks.====Three mechanisms explain the pattern of falling household mobility and falling house prices. One explanation is that households with negative home equity, so-called underwater mortgages, are unable to finance the loss incurred when selling their house. This means that they are unable to transfer the outstanding mortgage debt into a new mortgage because they are unable to pay the transaction costs such as stamp-duty, notary fees and moving. These households are “locked” in their current property.==== Hence, even if these households would want to move the economic situation prevents them from moving.====Another explanation is that households with negative home equity do not want to move, rather than not being able to move. In the Netherlands, negative home equity is not always the result of a decrease in house price. On the contrary, mortgage origination with LTVs over 100% was quite common in our investigation period, since regulation allows homeowners to use the loan proceeds for financing transaction costs (e.g. stamp duty) as well as home improvements. Such households might be relatively immobile by choice, irrespective of the developments in the housing market. When testing the housing-lock-hypothesis, it is therefore important to control for potential self-selection into high LTVs. One example for this is a household who decided to settle in an urban region with good infrastructure and a large labor market. This decreases the necessity of moving residence due to job related changes because a household member can easily find another job close to home. Hence, high leverage can minimize monthly payments by exploiting the tax advantages stemming from the MID and, at the same time, high housing quality. It is therefore not entirely clear, from just purely comparing the mobility of high LTV households with low LTV households, if we identify the actual effect of negative home equity on household mobility.====A third explanation relates to loss aversion. The underlying idea is that homeowners use the highest price of the house as reference point. When the market value of the house falls below the reference point they are ==== to sell their house and move, regardless of their economic situation. Our empirical strategy also controls for loss aversion.====This study has three key contributions to the empirical literature on home equity and mobility. The first contribution relates to our identification strategy. To our knowledge we are the first who distinguish between potential self-selection into negative home equity and households which have negative home equity as a result of a decrease in house price. The second contribution is our data set. Where most of the recent studies make use of selected samples or survey data, we construct a unique panel dataset based on administrative records. It covers annual mobility patterns of ==== Dutch homeowners since 1995, including newly built property houses as well as existing houses.==== We combine this data with information on income, wealth, household composition and many other household characteristics.====The third contribution of this paper is that the institutional context in the Netherlands and the richness of the microdata allow us to correct for potential systematic biases that are not solved in the current empirical literature. Since high LTVs at origination are the norm, especially in our investigation period, this suggests that the lack of a required down payment at the time of purchase does not play a major role in reducing residential mobility. Further, banks have full-recourse to all the assets and income of borrowers who default on their mortgage loan. For this reason strategic default with high LTVs, which can increase household mobility, is nonexistent in the Netherlands. Next, since we observe ==== house price changes we can also control for loss aversion which can hamper residential mobility, too. Lastly, our data also allows us to control for two remaining endogeneity problems which cannot be tackled in the current literature. The first one is heterogeneity on the level of the household and the second one are local economic conditions which in turn can affect mobility. We tackle the first by making use of fixed effects on the level of the household. The second problem is solved by making use of regional labor market fixed effects interacted with the year.====We place our paper in the literature on negative home equity and mobility. Many studies use data from the US which differ in their institutional settings from many European countries. More specifically, in the Netherlands lenders have full recourse and benefit from tax subsidies in the form of mortgage interest deductibility. Similar institutional settings existed for instance in Spain and Ireland and still exist in Denmark and Sweden (Turk, 2015, IMF, 2015). Furthermore, the LTVs at origination are on average substantially higher in the Netherlands than in the US, while default rates are relatively low.==== This is why we think that both researchers and policy makers can learn about the effect of high levels of household debt and residential mobility. The evidence from the international literature on household mobility and negative equity is mixed. Bricker and Bucks (2016) investigate household mobility in the US in the period from 2007/09 by making use of the Survey of Consumer Finance. They find a positive association between negative home equity and the probability of moving. They explain this finding as the result of involuntary moves due to for instance foreclosure. Andersson and Mayock (2014) find a decline in household mobility of 25% due to reductions in home equity for homeowners in Florida. Ferreira et al. (2010) find that mobility of homeowners in the US with negative equity is almost 50% lower than the mobility of other owners. The results of this study are revised by Schulhofer-Wohl (2011) who finds that households with negative equity are more likely to move. This is more in line with the evidence presented by Coulson and Grieco (2013) who find that negative home equity is associated with higher levels of mobility for households in the US. Engelhardt (2003) finds little evidence that falling house prices constrain mobility using survey data from the US in the period between 1985 and 1996. He explains that nominal loss aversion can be a key driver for a decline in mobility. This explanation is supported by further empirical evidence of Einiö et al. (2008). In our analysis we run specifications which control for this potential mechanism by taking the decline in house prices into account. There are two recent papers which also investigate household mobility and negative home equity in the Netherlands. Struyven (2014) investigates the effect of negative home equity on household mobility using similar data. He finds a significant negative effect of negative home equity on household mobility. Our study is different from his study in three important aspects. First, we are able to incorporate newly built properties in our analysis. Secondly, we distinguish between several channels through which home equity might influence household mobility. More specifically, we: (i) differentiate between households which are underwater due to the LTV at origination and households which went underwater due to housing market bust; (ii) we control for the effect of the housing price decline itself and (iii) we are able to control for unobserved heterogeneity on the household level. Steegmans and Hassink (2018) investigate in an interesting study the effect of negative home equity for a selected sample of homeowners while controlling for loss aversion. They find that both loss aversion and negative equity limit household mobility. However, they also do not differentiate between possible effects of becoming an underwater household versus selection effects into negative home equity. Moreover, they do not take into account potential endogeneity arising from heterogeneity among households.====The effects of negative home equity on residential mobility are relevant for policy makers. This is because especially in the wake of the recent developments on housing markets the policies which were meant to stimulate homeownership can have unintended adverse effects on outcomes such as consumption or residential mobility. The latter can potentially translate to lower labor mobility and frictions on the labor market (Oswald, 1996, Oswald, 1997, Oswald, 1999, Blanchflower and Oswald, 2013). This study also fits within the current policy debate in many OECD countries on the effects of household debt-overhang on economic outcomes (see for instance IMF (2014)). One topic of debate is on the re-profiling of underwater mortgages (on a large scale). A rationale for such a policy could be that negative home equity and household deleveraging can potentially generate negative externalities by (1) reducing mobility that affects the recovery of the housing market, and (2) reducing labor mobility.====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section II gives an overview of the institutional setup and the data set, its construction and the most important descriptive statistics. Section III describes the empirical strategy.

After interest rates reached the zero lower bound (ZLB), unconventional monetary policy became the primary monetary policy tool in many countries. Theoretical and empirical studies suggest that unconventional monetary policy measures can be effective tools if short-term interest rates cannot be changed (Paavola, 2016). Unconventional monetary policy may also affect the prices of long-term assets (Gagnon et al., 2011). One area where unconventional monetary policy may have an effect is house prices. From the existing literature it may be expected that in case of both conventional and unconventional expansionary monetary policy shocks the demand for house purchases would increase and hence the house prices would start to rise, but the transmission mechanisms would be different. The rise in liquidity caused by unconventional monetary policy measures would increase the credit supplied by the banks, and this in turn would reduce the lending rates and the interest rate spreads of the banks (Peersman, 2011). With an expansionary conventional monetary policy shock, there would be a decline in the banks’ lending rates and a rise in the interest rate spreads.====Housing wealth comprises a large share of the wealth of households. It is relevant to study the role of monetary policy in house price dynamics, since interest rates have been historically low since the beginning of the financial crisis, and this could raise the risk of a housing market bubble occurring that could impact economic and financial stability. As unconventional monetary policy measures may also be needed in the future, it is important to study how shocks from such policies affect house prices and to compare their effects with those of conventional monetary policy shocks. This will reveal whether unconventional monetary policy measures taken in an environment where the policy rate is constrained by the ZLB could influence house prices. It is also important to examine whether there are differences in the impacts across countries that share many economic characteristics but have different monetary policy regimes, like the Scandinavian countries for instance.====House prices rose and fell a long way in many European countries, including the Scandinavian countries. In this paper I focus on the three Scandinavian countries, Sweden, Norway and Denmark. The housing sector has played an important part in the dynamics of the economic cycle in these countries. Not only were they severely affected by the Great Financial Crisis of 2008–2010, but those countries had also seen another cycle of real estate bubbles and busts in the early 1990s. The dynamics of house prices have been quite similar in the three countries, especially until 2008. All three Scandinavian countries experienced a housing boom before the Great Financial Crisis, but the subsequent falls in house prices that they experienced were of different magnitudes. The largest fall was in Denmark and the smallest in Sweden. Owner-occupancy rates==== are also different across the countries.====There are both similarities and differences in the housing loan systems of the Scandinavian countries. The three countries have quite similar average loan-to-value ratios and mortgage interest payments are tax deductible in all three countries. There are still some differences in the mortgage market structure that could lead to differences in how house prices react. Firstly, in Denmark the bulk of the housing loans are provided by mortgage credit institutions which fund themselves by issuing covered bonds, while in Sweden and Norway housing loans are given by commercial banks. Secondly, the mortgage debt-to-GDP ratio is higher in Denmark than in the other two countries. The mortgage market in all three of the Scandinavian countries can be considered highly developed, but according to the IMF mortgage market index==== the mortgage market in Denmark has the highest degree of development and completeness.====These three advanced small open economies, which have had two house price booms and busts and have similar economic backgrounds but different monetary policy systems, different owner-occupancy rates, and mortgage market structures with similarities and differences, provide a good case for exploring how different monetary policy measures impact house prices. Sweden announced purchases of government bonds in 2015. Although there has been no official unconventional monetary policy in Norway or Denmark, the effects of balance sheet policies in Norway have been studied earlier by Gambacorta et al. (2014) and Rahal (2016) for example, and those in Denmark by e.g. Behrendt (2013). The results of the current paper may be seen as benchmarks for understanding and forecasting how different monetary policy measures impact house prices in other small open welfare economies.====The aim of this paper is to study the impact of conventional and unconventional monetary policy on house prices in the Scandinavian countries, covering the policy rate and balance sheet policies of the central banks over a period of nearly 30 years. I address three questions in this paper. First, I study how conventional and unconventional monetary policy affect house prices within each of the three Scandinavian countries. Second, I investigate whether there are differences in the timing and the magnitude of the effects of the two types of monetary policy shock. Third, I explore whether the effects are different across the three countries.====I use Bayesian structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) models identified with a combination of sign and zero restrictions, following for example Baumeister and Benati (2013), Peersman (2011), Schenkelberg and Watzka (2013), Boeckx et al. (2017), Rahal (2016), and Weale and Wieladek (2016). This approach enables to sharpen the identification of the structural shocks and hence, by using additional economic information it can interpret the impulse response functions better.====The estimation results show that expansionary shocks to the policy rate and to the central bank's balance sheet both have a positive effect on house prices in all the Scandinavian countries. Following the previous literature I expected that the impact of a balance sheet shock on house prices would be more sluggish than that of a policy rate shock, and this was indeed the case for Sweden and Denmark. In Norway however, the speed of the reaction is similar for both types of monetary policy shock. In all the Scandinavian countries the effect of a balance sheet shock peaks higher and is more persistent than the effect of a policy rate shock. The results are robust to different model specifications. It is striking how different the responses to each type of monetary policy shock are within each country, whereas the responses of each variable to each monetary policy shock are very similar across the countries.====There is an extensive empirical literature suggesting that house price dynamics are closely interrelated with macroeconomic variables. Englund and Ioannides (1997), Tsatsaronis and Zhu (2004), Égert and Mihaljek (2007) and Goodhart and Hoffmann (2008) for example study the determinants of house prices in a range of industrialised countries, including the three Scandinavian countries. Capozza et al. (2002) and Case and Shiller (2003) explore the relationship between US house prices and other key variables. Kasparova and White (2001) examine the degree of similarity in housing market responses to changes in macroeconomic forces in four countries, including Sweden. Iacoviello (2000) identifies the main macroeconomic factors behind house price fluctuations in six countries, including Sweden.====The impact of monetary policy rate shocks on house prices has also been studied in a number of papers such as Iacoviello (2000), Iacoviello and Minetti (2003), Goodhart and Hoffmann (2008), Musso et al. (2011), and Aspachs-Bracons and Rabanal (2011). These papers find that monetary policy rate shocks are important determinants of house price dynamics; a change in the monetary policy rate changes house prices in the opposite direction. The effect is temporary in Iacoviello (2000) and Iacoviello and Minetti (2003) but it is permanent or very persistent in Goodhart and Hoffmann (2008), Musso et al. (2011) and Aspachs-Bracons and Rabanal (2011).====A growing number of studies explore the effect of unconventional monetary policy on macroeconomic variables, and interest in this field has increased markedly since the global financial crisis. How an unconventional monetary policy shock affects output and consumer prices has been explored using a combination of zero and sign restrictions in VAR models in papers like Schenkelberg and Watzka (2013) and Gambacorta et al. (2014). Gambacorta et al. (2014) study the macroeconomic effects of unconventional monetary policies in eight advanced economies, including Norway and Sweden. Their panel VAR results show that the effects on output and prices are statistically significant but temporary. Individual country results show there to be a temporary effect on output and a temporary but quite persistent effect on prices in case of Sweden. In Norway the effects on output and prices are not statistically significant. Schenkelberg and Watzka (2013) explore the effects of quantitative easing in Japan and find that the effects on output and prices are statistically significant but temporary. The effect of unconventional monetary policy on consumer prices and stock market indexes in nine countries, including Sweden and Denmark, is explored by Behrendt (2013), using the Cholesky decomposition for identification. The effects on consumer prices are statistically insignificant in Denmark and are initially negative in Sweden until they become statistically insignificant after a few months.====Peersman (2011) and Baumeister and Benati (2013) use zero and sign restrictions and include conventional and unconventional shocks in one VAR model as I do in this paper, but they do not include house prices as a variable. They have the consumer prices/GDP deflator in the model instead. According to Peersman (2011), conventional monetary policy shocks are innovations to the credit supply that result from a shift in the monetary policy rate, and unconventional monetary policy shocks are innovations to the credit supply caused by monetary policy actions that are orthogonal to the policy rate. The results of Peersman (2011) indicate that both conventional and unconventional monetary policy shocks have statistically significant temporary effects on output and permanent effects on the level of prices. The effect of the unconventional monetary policy shock is more sluggish, as the increases in output and prices only become statistically significant after approximately one year and the peak effect occurs at least six months later than it does following a conventional monetary policy shock. Baumeister and Benati (2013) use a time-varying VAR model and find statistically significant temporary effects on output and price.====There is only a little literature on the impact that unconventional monetary policy shocks have on the housing market. It has been studied by Rahal (2016), Gabriel and Lutz (2017), Smith (2014) and Huber and Punzi (2016). Rahal (2016) uses zero and sign restrictions as I do in this paper, and he explores the impact in eight OECD countries, including Sweden and Norway, in panel VAR and also separately for each country. His results (only medians are displayed) show a temporary effect on house prices in Sweden and a hump-shaped but eventually permanent effect in Norway. Gabriel and Lutz (2017) do not include house prices as a variable and they identify the monetary policy shock with the assumption that the variance of the shock is heteroskedastic across event and non-event days. Smith (2014) concentrates mainly on developing a financial mechanism connecting housing and real economics using US data. He also compares the impacts of announcements of alternative unconventional monetary policy measures on output and house prices, simulating different scenarios and using the Cholesky decomposition for identification. Rahal (2016), Gabriel and Lutz (2017), and Smith (2014) analyse only unconventional monetary policy shocks in the model. I will include both types of monetary policy shock in my model and use longer time series. Huber and Punzi (2016) apply time-varying VAR, use the shadow interest rate for the unconventional monetary policy variable, and identify the unconventional monetary policy shock using only sign restrictions in their main analysis. In the robustness check, which is only presented for the USA, they label the spread shock as the unconventional monetary policy shock, and use zero and sign restrictions. They also have the conventional monetary policy shock in the identification scheme of their robustness check, but they do not show or comment on the results or compare them with the impact of the unconventional monetary policy shock.====My paper contributes to the literature in two ways. First, I develop a unique identification scheme in which I study the impact of two types of monetary policy shock on house prices in one model, using zero and sign restrictions. Second, to the best of my knowledge, I am the first to compare the impacts of the two types of monetary policy shock on house prices in each of the Scandinavian countries and the differences in the impacts across the three countries, which have very similar economic backgrounds and different monetary policy regimes.====The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 introduces the model and describes the data. Section 3 discusses the details of the identification scheme.

From the time of their arrival, and until a decision on their asylum requests is made, asylum seekers are sheltered in asylum seeker reception centers (ASRCs) across the country. This paper tests whether the opening of reception centers affects the prices of nearby houses. In doing so, likely differential effects across urban and non-urban areas, as well as for ASRCs of distinct capacities to host asylum seekers, are considered. The analysis uses hedonic regressions that are based on a staggered difference-in-differences design. Estimation comes from 2009–2017 information on the transaction prices of houses (==== = 347,479) and the locations and opening dates of nearby ASRCs (==== = 75). The results indicate that the opening of ASRCs causes the prices of some houses to fall by approximately 9.3%. However, this estimated effect pertains solely to single-family houses in less densely populated areas and for ASRC of high hosting capacity, whereas in cities no economically or statistically significant effects are found. The findings of this study have implications for the design of public policies that regard the spatial dispersion of ASRCs.","The inflow of asylum seekers==== to European countries has increased rapidly in recent years. In 2011, the number of asylum applications was 309,040 and this number grew to 1.26 million in 2016. Countries are required to provide material reception==== to asylum seekers, but countries can themselves decide on the location of shelter (European Migration Network, 2014; Proietti and Veneri, 2019). The inflow of asylum seekers in a specific place can potentially affect several aspects of that area, including the labor market and the provision of services or the housing market (Gheasi and Nijkamp, 2017). Housing market outcomes are the focus of this study, which investigates whether, for the case of the Netherlands, the opening of asylum seekers reception centers (ASRC) is a source of externalities that can be detected from local house prices. Our analysis is relevant for policy makers, as policies on the spatial allocation of asylum seeker reception tend to disperse ASRCs across space, in order to alleviate cities – but might this produce externalities where these are most pressing?====The empirical literature on how local communities regard the reception of asylum seekers is fragmented. Some studies have highlighted the existence of mixed attitudes, for example, humanitarianism and opposition (Fratesi et al., 2019; Hangartner et al., 2018; Zorlu, 2017). Others have investigated the effect of the inflow of asylum seekers and refugees on electoral outcomes (Bratti et al., 2017; Dennison et al., 2017; Dustmann et al., 2016; Otto and Steinhardt, 2014; Steinmayr, 2016; Witteveen, 2017). However, there is little evidence of how local inhabitants respond to ASRCs in terms of actual market behavior. Actual market behavior, instead of declared attitudes or voting patterns, offers a basis for more precise assessment of people's reactions towards ASRCs. Studies on attitudes in particular, tend to examine ‘stated preferences’, see for example Facchini et al. (2016), Grigorieff et al. (2017), or Hopkins et al. (2018), which may allow socially acceptable answers to impact findings. Unlike such studies, we consider preferences that are revealed in local housing markets. To our knowledge, the impact of ASRCs on house prices is only addressed in a working paper by Lastrapes and Lebesmuehlbacher (2017), which analyzes such impacts in England and Wales over 2004–2015, at the aggregate level of districts. Such aggregated analysis, however, may obscure the finer-scale patterns in how the prices of houses close to ASRCs, thus below the regional level, respond to ASRC openings. Our approach, instead, is to use micro-level data on house transactions; this approach considers that, as potential buyers for houses that are listed for sale compete with each other, the outcomes of this process may reflect an implicit valuation of perceived (dis)amenities of living ==== to an ASRC.====While a priori the sign and magnitude of the possible ASRC effect are ambiguous, we suspect that ASRCs might negatively impact the prices of nearby houses given several phenomena that are well-documented in the literature: the process of ‘othering’ from migrant residents (Brons, 2015); the perception of increased crime levels after the inflow of asylum seekers (Dempster and Hargrave, 2017); and the overcrowding of local public services and competition between incumbents and newcomers for access to services (OECD, 2018a).====However, the locations of ASRCs are heterogeneous as these include both cities and non-urban areas. This situation results from a system of reception that is decentralized under the rationale of de-concentrating the hosting locations while also attaining some cost-efficiency, as in areas of low-population density land prices are low. Hence, our analysis considers whether ASRCs have a differential impact across urban and non-urban areas. Our expectation is that the ASRCs effect, if any, is stronger in non-urban areas. While on the one hand the influx of asylum seekers might have positive externality-effects on local development by counteracting ageing and depopulation, see OECD (2018a), importantly, non-urban areas may have limited ability to absorb any negative externalities that ASRCs may bring about. For example, if compensatory amenities are not provided, non-urban residents might experience an overcrowding of public services. Moreover, non-urban residents have, in general, had less exposure to migrants as compared to the residents of cities, as in cities the composition of the population is, on average, more diverse; perhaps for this reason, in cities, sentiment towards migrants has been documented to be significantly more positive than in non-urban areas (Diaz-Ramirez et al., 2018). Even so, it is possible that the potential externalities from ASRCs are simply more visible in non-urban areas, particularly when relatively large ASRCs are involved.====This study of possible ASRC externality-effects uses a model that is well-established in the literature on revealed preferences, the hedonic price model. This type of model uses regression to disentangle house prices into implicit marginal prices for the individual attributes of houses. In our more specific case, we adopt a difference-in-differences approach that closely follows Pope and Pope (2015) and Slade (2018). The difference-in-differences approach allows us to compare housing prices in same-areas before and after the opening of ASRCs, and thereby difference away the possible influence of time-invariant omitted variables (Meyer, 1995). The identification relies on the assumption that price trends for houses nearby ASRCs and houses farther away, but within the same spatial submarket, would have remained similar if ASRCs had not been opened. In this quasi-experimental analysis, we pay specific attention to the definition of the so-called treatment and control groups as we isolate the price-effect of ASRCs.====Our estimation draws on a comprehensive dataset on house sales throughout the Netherlands from January 2009 to December 2017 as well as information on all existing and newly opened ASRCs.==== This ensures high variation in the observed data, as we exploit the dispersed pattern of ASRC locations to investigate the potential ASRC-effect for houses across urban and non-urban areas. These areas are defined in a consistent way using the OECD-EC functional urban areas definition.====Our findings indicate that the opening of ASRCs may affect negatively the prices of nearby homes. However, the effect is of economic and statistical significance only in the particular case of single-family homes in non-urban areas, and solely associated with the largest of ASRCs, those that can host 500 or more asylum seekers. This result is robust with various changes in model specification and several falsification analyses. Our study's findings may inform policy makers who specify the allocation of ASRCs’ in terms of their location and dimension.====The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a review of the literature and introduces the Dutch study area's institutional setting in relation to asylum seeker center dispersal policy.

The policy change created a new AS-zone around central Auckland, with higher subsidy maxima for residents within the zone. Using administrative data on AS recipients on either side of the new zone boundary, we estimate that average support was $6.80 per week higher inside than outside the boundary in the second year after the policy change, and about one-third ($2.44) passed through to higher rent. The impacts were concentrated among families with children and, consistent with the policy changes, among higher quantiles of the rent distribution. The results imply the marginal propensity to spend on housing is about 0.35, and the elasticity of housing expenditure with respect to income is about 0.55.","Most developed countries provide a range of housing policies, of which housing allowance programs are the most common. While the programs differ in design, they all provide payments to low income households to subsidise housing-costs. The programs typically support private sector tenants, although in some countries recipients also include public sector tenants or home owners. The programs are often large, costing up to 1.8% of GDP (Salvi Del Pero et al., 2016). Housing allowances aim to ensure that those on low incomes can afford housing without significant financial hardship. There is evidence that housing allowance programs improve housing outcomes by reducing homelessness, over-crowding and living in poor quality homes and neighbourhoods (Kennedy, 1980; Mills et al., 2006; Orr et al., 2003; Wood et al., 2008). Allowances also appear to enable increased expenditure on other items such as food and clothing (Jacob and Ludwig, 2012; Mills et al., 2006), and provide recipients with increased choices which may be important to reduce risks related to family violence and child protection (Gubits et al., 2016).====A major concern with housing allowances is that they lead to upward pressure on the market price of private rental accommodation. If this occurs the effectiveness of the instrument is undermined by the value of the subsidy captured by landlords rather than recipients (Salvi Del Pero et al., 2016). The existing research literature has often found that housing allowances can have a sizeable impact on market rents, although there is significant variability in findings, and the magnitude of the impacts vary across country, time and estimation method.====In this paper we exploit a natural experiment created by a 2005 policy change to New Zealand's largest housing support program, the Accommodation Supplement (AS), to examine the impact of an increase in the value of a housing allowance on rents. The AS provides cash payments to low income individuals and families, which depend on their housing costs, family size and income, housing tenure, and location. The Accommodation Supplement currently provides assistance for 11% of the population at a cost of just over 0.4% of GDP, with about two-thirds of recipients being renters.==== The AS program is similar to housing subsidy programs in many countries – e.g. Australia (Martin et al., 2016), France (Laferrère and Le Blanc, 2004), and Finland (Kangasharju, 2010) – but differs in several respects from the US Housing Choice Voucher program.====The 2005 policy change that we focus on subdivided the existing Auckland AS-zone into two distinct zones, consisting of the central and northern urban areas of the city (Zone-1) and the outer urban areas. This change reflected high and rising housing costs in central Auckland (e.g. inflation adjusted house prices increased more than 50% in Auckland between 2001 and 2006). The policy change led to substantial increases in the level of AS available to residents inside relative to outside Zone-1: depending on family size, the AS maxima increased 28–45% for recipients inside the zone boundary relative to those outside. By comparing changes in accommodation support and rental costs of recipients on either side of, but close to, the zone boundary, we examine whether the policy change led to relative increases in housing rental costs within Zone-1.====Our analysis uses data derived from New Zealand Ministry of Social Development administrative records of all Accommodation Supplement claimants since 2003. The data contains information on the characteristics of the primary claimant, including details of their family and income. Information on their physical address has been geocoded to identify recipients close to the new Auckland Zone-1 boundary. Our analytical sample focusses on dwellings within 1 km either side of this boundary and, to minimise possibly confounding effects of other secular changes, we focus on the four year period around the 2005 policy change, over which this policy change was the dominant factor.====We first document changes in AS and other housing-related payment over the study period. As a result of the policy change, the fraction of recipients receiving the AS-maximum fell 15 percentage points more for those inside. There was a modest relative increase (about $5 per week, or 5%) in the combined value of AS and other housing related payments for recipients on the inside of the boundary. The number of people receiving AS increased by roughly the same rate on either side of the boundary over the following two years. The average rent on the inside increased about $1.90 per week (1%) more on the inside compared to the outside.====We then use regression adjusted difference-in-differences methods to analyse the nature and impact of the policy change. We find no significant effect on rents in the year following the policy change, perhaps reflecting time lags for tenancy rents to adjust. Focussing on the second year after the policy change, we estimate that accommodation related support payments increased by $6.81 more, on average, for those on the inside than the outside, and that rental payments increased by $2.44 per week more. Also, as expected given the policy change increased the maximum amount of AS payable on the inside, we find larger increases in both subsidies and rents for recipients at the higher end of the rent distribution. Our results imply a marginal propensity to spend on housing of about 0.35, and an elasticity of housing expenditure with respect to income of about 0.55. Repeating the analysis by subgroup we find the effects were primarily concentrated among AS-recipients around the Southern boundary, and among families with children (particularly sole parent families). Finally, we conclude that most of the impact on rent was associated with tenancy changes, perhaps because that is when rent changes mostly occur.====The paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we briefly discuss the nature of the Accommodation Supplement policy, detail the 2005 policy change that we exploit in our analysis, and briefly review the literature on the impacts of demand-side housing subsidies on subsequent rent and housing costs. Section 3 describes the administrative data, and how we construct the data extract used.

Theoretical results show that (1) an increase in FAR in a central zone may harm the utility of suburban residents due to the residential segregation pattern of heterogeneous people whereas it always increases the utility in a city with homogeneous households, and (2) how an increase in FAR changes land rents depends on the current FAR and the relative location of the zone where FAR increases. Numerical results clarify the effects of optimal FAR regulations on residents and absentee landowners. In addition, theoretical result (1) denoted above is numerically verified. Furthermore, it is found that optimal FAR gives higher benefits to high income households than to ==== regardless of the location pattern.","Today, many cities in the world suffer from severe traffic congestion, which wastes a massive amount of time and fuel. Many cities have imposed land use regulations such as regulations on building size or height, or lot size, which can adjust urban externalities including traffic congestion. However, cities have heterogeneous agents. So, even if the regulations increase the social welfare, all the agents will not necessarily increase their respective welfare. When implementing the regulations, we need to consider how each agent is affected.====We theoretically clarify the welfare effect of floor area ratio (FAR) regulation on heterogeneous households with income disparity and landowners in a congested closed city. In addition, we numerically simulate FAR regulation to explore the distribution of wealth among agents.====Traffic congestion is an externality because an additional motorist pays only her private cost and not the marginal social cost generated by her role in increasing other motorists’ travel time. The first-best policy against such externality is to impose a congestion toll that varies at each point such that every motorist would face the marginal social cost. However, it is difficult to implement it because of enormous implementation and operation costs, as indicated by Rouwendal and Verhoef (2006). Furthermore, toll payers, who are generally welfare-losers, reject the policy of congestion tolling.====Because of the difficulty of implementing the first-best congestion pricing, the policy should be replaced with some second-best policies. In real society, city governments in most cities impose land use regulations which can serve useful practical alternatives to congestion toll policies as the second-best policies.====The efficiency of land use regulations has been analyzed by recent papers. The efficacy of regulating on building sizes and city sizes in a congested city was theoretically and numerically evaluated by comparing welfare gain from laissez-faire (Bertaud and Brueckner, 2005; Kono et al., 2012). Rhee et al. (2014) and Kono and Joshi (2017) show the efficiency of land use control in the model combined with production. Urban growth boundary (UGB) regulation is analyzed as an effective second-best remedy for unpriced traffic congestion (Brueckner, 2007). Policies including land use regulations should consider the distribution of wealth among agents as well as the efficiency. Indeed, policies are politically acceptable if they can be designed in such a way that a large majority of the population will benefit.====Kono et al., (2010), assuming a closed two discrete city model, show a necessity for minimum as well as maximum FAR regulations to maximize social welfare. Kono and Joshi (2012) explore the difference in optimal regulation between an open city and a closed city. Joshi and Kono (2009) target a growing city with congestion. Kono and Joshi (2017) address a city with agglomeration economies and transport congestion. Kono and Kawaguchi (2017) introduce cordon pricing in a city with land use regulation. These papers show that different regulations are required in different second-best situations due to the effects of the specific distortions, and that it is important for policy makers to check what distortions are relevant before determining land use regulations. However, these papers as well as a recent book by Kono and Joshi (in press) mainly focus on efficiency, although the welfare of land owners and residents are compared partly. The current paper focuses on the welfare of income heterogenous residents. To design land use regulations, policy makers should pay attention to low-income residents in particular, because even in developed countries lowest-income residents suffer from poverty.====The distribution of wealth of urban policies has been analyzed by many papers (e.g., Dubin et al., 1992; Arnott et al., 1994; Buyukeren and Hiramatsu, 2015).==== Similarly, the distribution of wealth of land use regulations has been analyzed. For instance, Brueckner (1995), investigating urban growth controls about the welfare of landowners and that of households, show that the growth controls harm consumers while enriching landowners. This result clearly shows that we should differentiate residents from landowners for welfare analysis.====The effects of a FAR regulation differ across locations. Kono et al. (2012) numerically demonstrate that optimal FAR regulation decreases land rent in areas close to the central business district (CBD) while it increases that in other areas. The geographical difference in changes in land rent indicates that the benefits of landowners depend on which area's land they own, and that the location of the households also matters for changes in the welfare of the households if heterogeneous residents reside separately. Heterogeneous households choose different locations to live. In particular, income heterogeneity yields a residential segregation pattern in which population groups are sorted into different zones (Fujita, 1989). However, past theoretical studies on land use regulation have not considered heterogeneous people.====The purpose of the present paper is to investigate the effects of land use regulations on heterogeneous households and landowners, using a simple setting of a monocentric model with three residential zones and a CBD. To focus on the distribution effects of land use regulation on residents and landowners, absentee landownership is assumed. The three zones are connected by bridges. The commuting costs are incurred only when crossing congested bridges. This simple setup allows the derivation of a number of analytical results although it is less realistic than the continuous-space framework used in several previous works of land use regulations. We analyze a case of homogeneous households and that of heterogeneous households to compare them.====After obtaining such theoretical analyses, we demonstrate numerical simulations to clarify the welfare effects of FAR regulations on residents and landowners. Theoretical results show the effects on the economy of changes in FAR in only a single zone. FAR should be optimized in all the zones simultaneously to maximize the welfare. This optimization is conducted numerically in the current paper, and the optimal situation is compared to the market equilibrium situation.====The setting of geography plays an important role in determining the properties of optimal land use regulations. For example, by setting mixed-use zones in a non-monocentric city having residents with idiosyncratic tastes, and in a system of cities with homogeneous residents, respectively, Anas and Rhee (2007) shows that an expansive UGB may be necessary, which contradicts the traditional conclusions based on a monocentric city model. However, even if we use a monocentric city model, the results should be reasonably valid for any modifications on the model as long as the fundamental relationship between residential density and commuting costs is preserved (Brueckner, 2007; Sridhar, 2007). For example, even if a city has multiple centers, in the areas where all (or most) residents commute to one center or through one transportation node such as a station to the multiple centers, the fundamental relationship between the residential areas and the commuting center (or the transportation node) is the same as that in a monocentric city. Our target is to explore the effects of land use regulation on residents with different levels of income. Since these effects have not been clarified even in a monocentric city yet, we set a monocentric city with residents with different income levels.====The current paper focuses on only one city, and in particular residential areas of the city. As Anas and Pines (2008, 2012) show, if we consider more than one city, optimal land use regulations can differ from those when only one city is supposed. Furthermore, in a system of cities, because the population distribution across cities changes, we can take account of the effect of agglomeration economies arising from various reasons. Agglomeration patterns due to a framework of new economic geography models (e.g., Krugman, 1991; Fujita and Thisse, 2009) have been studied intensively.==== However, the number and the extent of studies on land use regulations in a framework of a system of cities are very limited, so they remain for future studies. However, optimal conditions on land use regulations derived from setting one city should be valid even for a system of cities.====Even when we focus on only one city, agglomeration economies also affect land use regulations in particular in business areas. Ross-Hansberg (2004) takes account of the existence of agglomeration spillovers of firms to explore zoning. Rhee et al. (2014), Zhang and Kockelman (2016), and Kono and Joshi (2017) consider the existence of agglomeration economies and traffic congestion to explore land use regulations. These papers do not set a point CBD, and instead consider a CBD with some area to explore land use regulations in the CBD.==== In contrast, the current paper ignores business areas, and focuses on the residential areas. Agglomeration economies in business areas basically do not affect optimal patterns of land use regulations within residential areas, although they affect the optimal size of the total residential areas (i.e., how land should be allocated to each land use purpose.)====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 develops a city model in two cases: homogeneous households and heterogeneous households. Section 3 shows the analysis of the effects on residents and landowners among zones. Numerical simulations are presented in Section 4.

This decline in the homeownership coincided with a reduction in the availability of mortgage credit, particularly among low-income (Anenberg et al., 2015) and minority households (Goodman et al., 2014).==== Given the well-documented racial disparities in non-housing wealth, income, and credit scores, policymakers that seek to expand homeownership to the less fortunate may be tempted to encourage the expansion of high-risk mortgages that reduce monthly payments at the cost of delayed amortization and potentially significant payment shocks.==== The experience of minority homeowners during the Great Recession that we document in this paper calls the wisdom of such any such policies into question.====Previous research (Gerardi, Willen, 2009, Bocian, Li, Ernst, Bocian, Li, Reid, Quercia, Rugh, 2015, Rugh, Albright, Massey, 2015, Bayer, Ferreira, Ross, 2016, Mayock, Malacrida, 2018) has documented that mortgages issued to minority borrowers defaulted at significantly higher rates than loans issued to White homeowners during the most recent downturn in the housing market. The factors underlying these racial differences in default rates, however, are not well understood, and this is a deficiency in the literature that must be addressed if we hope to use housing finance policy to create sustainable homeownership for low-income and minority households. In this paper we attempt to address this deficiency by using a database of nearly 3 million purchase mortgages originated between 2005 and 2009 to provide the first evidence on the extent to which racial differences in mortgage default rates can be explained by differences in the prevalence of non-standard mortgage characteristics.====The first portion of our analysis investigates the likelihood that minority borrowers received mortgages with the following high-risk features: loans collateralized by a second residence or investment property, terms in excess of 30 years, “piggyback” mortgage debt, limited or no documentation, prepayment penalties, negative amortization features, balloon payments, interest-only periods, and loans that had a scheduled payment reset in the first 48 months following origination. Conditional on borrower race alone, we find that minority borrowers were significantly more likely to have loans with such features. Systematic racial differences in several of these characteristics remain even when we condition on a full set of controls that capture variation in borrower creditworthiness, location, and when the loan was originated. The existing literature on racial differences in mortgage contracts is sparse, and the limited empirical research on the topic has been based on data from a single lender in a single city or to loans that were issued to borrowers with impaired credit (Bocian, Li, Reid, Quercia, Rugh, 2015, Rugh, Albright, Massey, 2015). One of the primary contributions of our paper is thus providing the first evidence on the link between a borrower’s race and the prevalence of high-risk mortgage contract characteristics using data throughout the U.S. and across the full credit spectrum.====The results from the loan performance analysis in the second portion of our paper suggest that the increased prevalence of exotic mortgage characteristics contributed significantly to the racial disparities in default rates.==== While previous work based on consumer credit records demonstrated that at least some of the racial differences in default behavior can be attributed to systematic differences in credit profiles and labor market shocks, because of data limitations these studies were unable to account for impact of high-risk mortgage characteristics on mortgage performance.==== In contrast to the existing literature, we overcome these limitations by including high-risk mortgage characteristics in our database from servicing files.==== The second major contribution of our study to the literature is thus providing the first evidence on the extent to which elevated minority default rates were attributable to variation in mortgage contracts.====Third, the size of our database allows us to estimate our empirical models using intra-neighborhood-year variation; this research design, when paired with our rich set of mortgage and borrower descriptors, enables us to estimate the impact of mortgage and borrower characteristics on default behavior more cleanly than in previous research. The totality of our results suggests that, when paired with low down payments, below-average price appreciation, and above-average income volatility, exotic mortgage characteristics served as an accelerant that exacerbated mortgage delinquency among minority borrowers. Lastly, we use the results from our regression analysis to conduct a decomposition exercise in which we quantify the relative importance of underwriting factors, a borrower’s neighborhood, and a borrower’s race in explaining variation in the prevalence of high-risk mortgage characteristics and mortgage performance. Our paper thus contributes to the growing literature that utilizes decomposition methods to study issues in housing and mortgage markets.====It should be noted that during the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis, a combination of increased regulatory scrutiny and shifting risk appetites among lenders resulted in a sharp contraction in the availability of mortgage products with many of the characteristics on which we focus in this paper. In recent years, however, risk taking in the mortgage market has increased, and several lenders have begun originating mortgages that have non-standard features. In 2018 lenders originated roughly $45 billion worth of mortgages with characteristics such as terms in excess of 30 years, interest-only periods, and limited documentation that do not satisfy the Consumer Financial Production Bureau’s definition of a Qualified Mortgage (QM) (Eisen, 2019). Some of these new mortgage products even utilize risk-layering in which several high-risk characteristics are combined in the same loan (NewRez, Lane, 2019). That said, while our paper admittedly relies upon data from only one point in the credit cycle, we view the findings from our analysis as speaking more generally to the impact of expanding access to mortgage credit through high-risk products on racial differences in delinquency rates.====The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents our empirical models, and in Section 3 we describe the construction of the database used to estimate these models and present summary statistics of key variables. The results for the mortgage characteristic and mortgage default models are presented in Sections 4 and 5, respectively.

In addition to demand-related factors, mechanisms with the potential to limit the housing supply may have also affected the price increase in that market. The objective of this study is to investigate the impact of zoning ordinances (land-use regulations) on the average rental prices and the growth in the number of dwellings in Brazil. Through an intercity analysis and using identification methods that rely both on selection on observable and unobservable covariates, the set of evidence indicates that zoning ordinance is associated with an increment ranging from 5.3% to 6% in average rents, but does not affect the dwellings growth. Sensitivity analysis suggests that these results are not simply driven by unobservable confounders. Our evidence, thus, indicates that even being a usually well-intentioned policy, zoning ordinances tend to generate social costs that need to be taken into account in the analysis of the real-estate market in Brazil.","In recent decades, a sharp increase in population concentration has taken place in major Brazilian metropolitan areas, continuing the rapid urbanization process that has been occurring in Brazil over the last century. For example, the population density of Brazilian urban areas grew 16.65% between 2000 and 2010. In the new metropolitan areas of Brasilia and Goiania, the population densities increased by 23.7% and 22.7%, respectively (Brazilian Demographic Census 2010). Due to higher population density around cities and macroeconomic stability, which increased housing credit, the Brazilian real-estate market underwent a price boom. According to the Fipe Zap index, which measures the selling price of properties and rentals in the main Brazilian cities on a monthly basis, from 2010 to 2015, housing prices increased 223.5% in Sao Paulo, whereas rents increased at a rate of 100.8%. This variation was significantly higher than inflation in the same period (which reached 54.6% as measured by IPCA, the official Brazilian consumer price index).====In addition to demand-related factors, supply-related factors such as the higher cost of real estate development and restrictions in urban land use may have also a connection with this great appreciation in the Brazilian real-estate market. One of the main ways to regulate and restrict urban land use in Brazil is through zoning ordinances. Zoning ordinances are usually established by local governments and can regulate both the type of use (establishing residential areas, commercial areas, industrial or mixed) and the intensity of use, restricting the size of buildings, their weight or the floor-area ratio (McDonald and McMillen, 2012). Note that, in addition to traditional zoning, there are other regulations that can be used to restrict urban land use, such as rules governing septic systems, wetland regulations, green-area requirements, and others (Fischel, 2004; Glaeser and Ward, 2009).====In Brazil, local governments (municipalities) are in charge of the adoption and the management of land-use controls. These instruments gained greater relevance in the late 80s, when the new Brazilian constitution gave more fiscal and administrative autonomy to municipalities. In addition, federal laws began to encourage local urban planning, such as Law 6766/79, which regulates the urban land parceling, and Law 10527/01, which establishes a series of guidelines for integrated urban planning in cities. In this context of the federal regulation of urban planning instruments, a large increase in the number of municipalities that have their own zoning ordinances occurred: while in 1978, only 64 municipalities had regulations for the land use, in 2013 this number had risen to 1724 (IBGE, 2013). Despite the recent increase in the adoption of these regulations and the vast empirical literature considering their effects elsewhere, few studies have investigated their impact on the Brazilian housing market and most of them focused on the impact of urban land regulation on housing informality (Lall et al., 2007, Biderman, 2008, Avila, 2015).====According to McDonald and McMillen (2012), the objective of the supporters of the law is to protect the residents' well-being from the adverse effects of industrialization, rapid and intense urbanization and high-impact buildings. Therefore, zoning would be useful to reduce the negative externalities that are associated with certain types of land use or degrees of use. However, by restricting the land use and limiting new developments, urban zoning ends up bringing changes to the land market and consequently may increase the prices of existing buildings and residences (Quigley, 2007; McDonald and McMillen, 2012). Thus, it creates a great incentive for homeowners to support, defend and fight for zoning laws (or other restriction instruments) with the aim of increasing the price of their houses, even in the absence of actual negative externalities (Quigley, 2007; Fischel, 2004).====Many empirical studies investigate the impact of zoning and land use restrictions on the housing and urban land market. Quigley and Rosenthal (2005); Quigley (2007) and McDonald and McMillen (2012) made detailed reviews of these studies. Even with different empirical strategies for different metropolitan areas in the United States, these papers show a similar conclusion: the degree of land use restrictiveness is positively correlated with property price and negatively correlated with new real-estate developments (Quigley and Raphael, 2005; Ihlanfeldt, 2007; Glaeser and Ward, 2009; Zabel and Dalton, 2011). Additionally, there is evidence that lot price is higher in more regulated areas (Kok et al., 2014) and that cities with stricter regulations suffer from a greater amplitude in the house price cycle, with more intense booms and bursts (Huang and Tang 2012).====The major empirical challenge of those papers is to solve the potential endogeneity in the relationship between zoning and real-estate prices. Typically, to overcome this problem, some studies add a wide range of control variables (Glaeser and Ward, 2009; and Kok et al., 2014), add fixed effects (Zabel and Dalton, 2011) or employ an instrumental variable approach (Ihlanfeldt, 2007). However, not all omitted variables can be measured or are fixed in time, which weakens the first two approaches. Moreover, it is extremely difficult to find an instrument that satisfies the exclusion restriction. For example, Ihlanfeldt (2007) received criticism for using past demographic characteristics as an instrument for the current level of land-use restrictiveness. It turns out that past demographics can be correlated with other current characteristics that affect property price, weakening the exclusion restriction (Glaeser and Ward, 2009). In addition to this unresolved empirical difficulty, another limitation of those studies is that they focus mostly on the U.S. housing market. Due to the recent urbanization process, the real-estate market of developing economies can behave in a very divergent way (Alterman, 2013), so that the conclusions of such papers cannot be easily extended to these countries.====In this study, we will take advantage of the variability of the law for the different Brazilian municipalities to assess their impact on the average rental prices and on the growth of the number of dwellings. The contribution of this paper is to analyze the Brazilian case, where, unlike the United States, the urbanization process only took off in the second half of the twentieth century. In addition, this study deals with endogeneity in different ways. First, rather than trying to solve the problem thoroughly, we will evaluate how robust our evidence is in the presence of endogeneity caused by omitted variables. In this sense, in order to obtain the effect of zoning on average rental prices and on the growth of the number of dwellings, we initially employ a Propensity Score Matching (PSM) estimator, that is based on selection on observable variables, and a set of sensibility analyses proposed by Rosenbaum, 2002, Inchino et al., 2008 and Oster (2017) are applied. Second, considering the possibility of selection on unobservable factors, we also apply more recent approaches based on heterocedasticity of error terms proposed by Klein and Vella (2010) and Lewbel (2012) that use, respectively, a control function and generated instrumental variables. Furthermore, another contribution of our study is to use a measure of rental prices, which is adjusted for the property's characteristics.====Our results reveal that municipalities that adopt zoning ordinances as an urban planning policy have average rental prices 5.32% to 6.03% higher than those of similar municipalities that do not. Although a causal interpretation is not fully guaranteed, the sensitivity analysis based on Rosenbaum bounds indicates that for our evidence to be invalidated there must be an unobservable variable that increases the odds of zoning adoption by 95% and is strongly correlated with the rental price. Additionally, the sensitivity analysis proposed by Inchino et al. (2008) shows that even if there are important and specific confounders, our result remains valid. The Oster (2017) procedure also points in the same direction: for our results to be invalidated, the unobservable confounders would need to be twice as important as the observable ones. Finally, these results are also supported when using the estimators of Klein and Vella (2010) and Lewbel (2012). However, we found that the zoning law is not able to affect the number of dwellings, suggesting that higher rental prices are not simply a reflection of a lower housing supply.====The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we discuss evidence from the previous literature that assesses the impact of land use restrictions from the perspective of developing economies. In Section 3, we present the institutional background and origins of zoning in Brazilian municipalities. Section 4 details the empirical strategy.

The basic finding is that, among various combinations of regional housing markets, Seoul has been the most influential market in Korea. We also present evidence that other metropolitan cities affect only the neighboring regions. As for the results from the rolling-sample analysis, the net directional connectedness of Seoul appears to have declined over the sample period. Although Seoul still remains the center of the Korean housing market, neighboring regions have become increasingly more influential in affecting other regional markets. These findings suggest that the policy for balanced national development might have changed the transmission mechanisms in the Korean housing market.","The development of housing financing in Korea, together with low interest rates and expansion of mortgage lending, has led to a rapid increase in housing prices in Korea since 2000. As housing prices of Gangnam-district in Seoul have experienced a particularly sharp increase during this period, earlier empirical and theoretical studies presented evidence that the rise in housing prices in Korea has been triggered by the Gangnam housing market.====In fact, housing is very expensive in Korean cities, especially in Seoul (Kim, 2004). Hence, the housing policies of the Korean government have mainly focused on the housing price stability of Seoul and the surrounding metropolitan area (Kim and Cho, 2010). Moreover, recent policies for balanced national development, such as the multifunctional administrative city (Sejong autonomous city), public sector relocation, and construction of innovation cities, have continued to settle regional differences between the metropolitan areas and local areas as a long-term plan. Given the pervasive intervention of the Korean government in the housing market, it is crucial for market participants to understand the transmission mechanism across regional housing markets in Korea.====Housing price levels may differ substantially depending on locations. Hence, different housing markets can be viewed as separate assets (Oikarinen, 2004). However, regional markets have become more correlated and connected than before, as the linkage across housing markets and macro-economic variables becomes stronger. With the increasing interdependence among housing markets, changes in housing price in one region can easily spill over to other regions. Thus, it is important to investigate the nature of connectedness in the housing market and to monitor its dynamics for investors and policymakers.====A considerable amount of literature has examined whether and to what extent regional housing markets move together with other regions. Examples of literature about the ripple effect in housing markets include Holmans (1990), Meen (1996), Berg (2002), Oikarinen (2004), Chien (2010), Chiang (2014), Antonakakis et al. (2018), Zhang and Fan (2019), and Zhang and Osmer (2019). Most empirical studies have found that housing price changes ripple out from central economic regions to surrounding areas and other local housing markets. In line with the connectedness among housing markets, the international housing market's co-movement has also received much attention in recent literature. Several researchers presented evidence that the international linkage among housing markets has increased since the global financial crisis. Examples of literature on the international housing market include Cesa-Bianchi (2013), Hirata et al. (2013), Liow (2013, 2014), and Lee and Lee (2016, 2018).====This paper explores the nature of connectedness among of the Korean regional housing markets in various aspects. In particular, we examine cross-regional spillover effects in the Korean housing market using the connectedness index and the network topology discussed in Diebold and Yilmaz (2014, 2016). The Diebold-Yilmaz methodology is useful in investigating lead-lag relationships among regional housing markets ==== various combinations of connectedness measures. We can further use this approach to monitor their time-varying pattern, which has an important implication on assessing the effectiveness of regional and national housing market policies.====While previous studies about the Korean housing market have mainly focused on the nature of interdependency among regional markets, this paper provides additional insights into various features of connectedness among regional housing markets using the connectedness framework. In particular, we mainly concentrate on the following issues. First, we investigate how closely the Korean regional housing markets are connected geographically. Hence, the results in this paper present new observations on cross-regional housing market connectedness, which are comparable with those in the UK (Antonakakis et al., 2018), China (Zhang and Fan, 2019), and the US (Zhang and Osmer, 2019).====Second, we reassess earlier evidence on the diffusion of housing prices from the center to the surrounding area by examining whether Seoul has been most influential in the Korean housing market. Third, we further analyze the transmission mechanism of regional housing prices using the network topology, which is useful to capture the underlying structure of the geographical linkages among regional housing markets. Fourth, we also discuss the dynamics of the Korean housing market connectedness. The dynamic feature of the network connectedness will provide useful information for investigating the extent to which the implementation of the “balanced national development policy” affected cross-regional spillovers among the Korean regional housing markets.====Overall, the results in this paper suggest important implications for investors and policymakers. From an investors’ perspective, the information on the direction and degrees of connectedness may be useful in portfolio management. Our results are also useful for policymakers to assess the effectiveness of the balanced national development policy, which is one of the most important policies concerning regional differences in the Korean housing market.====The basic findings can be summarized as follows. The connectedness among the Korean regional housing markets is quite high with an estimated connectedness measure of 64.33%. Seoul has been the most influential market in Korea among the various combinations of regional housing markets. However, the rolling-sample analysis shows that Seoul's influence appears to have declined over the sample period, whereas neighboring regions have become increasingly more influential in affecting other regional markets. The network analysis, based on pre-2000 and post-2000 subsamples, also confirms such findings. These observations suggest that the policy for balanced national development might impact the transmission mechanisms in the Korean housing market.====The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

This paper estimates the market valuation of future land-lease payments on the ====. This is useful for cities (like Amsterdam) that want to offer infinite lease terms, and can be also used to estimate long-run discount rates. We investigate the impact of: (i) the number of years that the land lease has been paid in advance and (ii) the amount that must be paid up front. Depending on the specification, houses on privately owned land are, on average, 11–13% more expensive than observably equivalent houses with a (non-prepaid) land-lease contract. Each year that no land lease has to be paid increases the price of a house by approximately 0.2%. Those findings correspond to a discount rate of 4% per year.","Knowing the extent to which house prices depend on various land-lease contracts is of considerable importance to cities that are considering whether they should introduce or discontinue a system of land lease. For example, Amsterdam introduced a new system of infinite land lease in 2017. Existing contracts receive an offer to change their current contract to the new one and this requires a proper pricing method of those contracts. There is also some debate in China about what to do with existing contracts that expire.==== The aim of this paper is to offer a simple methodology to calculate the market valuation of land lease and to price the maturity of contracts. Gaining insight into the way financial obligations in the (far away) future affect current prices also gives important information on long-run discount rates. Land lease is also common in several other European cities, including Frankfurt, Helsinki, London, Stockholm and Vienna.==== In addition, New York has some houses that are located on land that is owned by the city.====To investigate the market valuation of land lease, this paper uses a unique data set from Amsterdam based on land-lease contracts and information on residential real-estate transactions for the period January 1985 to December 2017.====With regard to our empirical methodology, we first look at the impact of the number of years that the land-lease rent is paid in advance (at the moment of a sale) on the house price. The land lease can be paid up to 75 years in advance in Amsterdam; these payments are not refundable but are transmitted in case the house changes hands. Hence, the number of years paid in advance can be regarded as exogenous for the potential house buyers. In addition, we use house fixed effects and we only use houses in areas of Amsterdam that were developed around the moment that land lease was introduced in 1896. This last strategy makes houses with a land-lease contract comparable to houses on privately owned land. Depending on the exact specification, we find that paying one year in advance results in an increase of the house price by approximately 0.2%. Identification comes here from houses that are sold at various points in time. At those different moments, the number of years that has to be paid in advance changes. We are also able to use this exercise to calculate the value of private land, which we find to be equal to 11–13% of the house price. Our findings imply that a house with land lease that is paid around 63 years in advance has an almost identical price as a house that is located on private land.====Next, we analyze the actual land-lease rent of houses for which the land-lease rent is not paid in advance. In Amsterdam, the land-lease rent depends on the estimated value of the house in the absence of the land lease. Hence, one cannot simply estimate the effect of land-lease rent on house prices by ordinary least squares (OLS) because houses for which a sizable amount of land lease must be paid would also, in the absence of the land lease, be more expensive. Therefore, we need an instrument. It turns out that the conditions prevailing during the year of the contract can be used as a suitable instrument because of changes in the terms of the contract. The terms of the land lease are specified in a contract called the “general conditions” (GC). This implies that two houses with the same number of remaining years of the contract can have a different number of years since the contract start if one of them is subject to an earlier GC. Since house prices increase in the starting year of the contract (earlier contracts are more favorable) and since the land-lease rent increases with the price of the house, this implies that houses with older contracts pay less land lease. Therefore, contract length conditional on the number of remaining years of the contract varies exogenously with the land lease. The estimate differs greatly between using OLS and instrumental variable (IV) estimation. Using OLS, land lease is positively associated with house prices. Using IV, however, we find that a 1 Euro increase of the land-lease rent decreases the selling price by 52 Euro.====Finally, we use our findings to estimate the long-run discount rate. Based on some additional assumptions, we find that our estimates of the discount rate equal 4.08% per year.====A key contribution to the literature of land lease is Giglio et al. (2015), who look at the impact of leasehold versus freehold in London and Singapore and find a negative and significant impact of leasehold – especially when the remaining lease length is relatively short (in their case, 80 to 100 years). Fesselmeyer et al. (2016) look at newly built apartments in Singapore. Hjalmarsson and Hjalmarsson (2009) look at the impact of future rents for co-ops in Sweden. They conclude that houses with higher rents are overpriced, once they take into account the discounted value of future rents. They also find that this overpricing is even more apparent in areas with low levels of education, indicating that individuals may have difficulties in understanding the financial obligations of the co-ops in the future. Janssen (2003) uses Swedish data of income property and compares houses on private land with houses that pay land lease. He finds an average increase in selling prices of 16.87 Euro for a one Euro increase in the land-lease rent. In contrast to the data used by Janssen (2003), our data allow us to also look at the value for each year that no land lease has to be paid. Moreover, our data are extremely rich in terms of observable house characteristics and provide us with a great deal of within-neighborhood variation in terms of houses on private land and houses with various land-lease contracts.====The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the land-lease system in Amsterdam. Section 3 describes our data sources. Sections 4 and 5 discuss our main results for the two empirical exercises performed in this paper. In Section 6 we discuss how our results can be used to estimate the discount rate and what the potential pitfalls of doing this may be.

A growing sector of online commerce is peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms, in which two people interact directly as buyers and sellers, rather than making purchases at a brick-and-mortar store or visiting the website of a business. Sharing economy businesses have sprung up as the newest incarnation of the P2P model, allowing members to buy or share certain goods and services through a central platform. Buyers can bike, car, or apartment share by simply renting the product for a short period of time from the seller.====Unlike in traditional markets, participants on these platforms most often do not meet in person before agreeing to a transaction. Moreover, strangers on these platforms are not likely to have the reputational safety of a brick-and-mortar store, and thus have a harder time credibly guaranteeing the quality of their product. These factors contribute to a higher perceived risk of transacting online.====As a result, many sharing economy platforms have instituted measures to mitigate this risk. Most have user profiles and encourage users to post their names and photos, as well as descriptions of themselves and their products, to bolster credibility. Platforms often solicit reviews from previous buyers that are posted alongside the product, or on the seller’s profile, to aid future buyers by increasing transparency and thereby encouraging transactions. However, the presence of identifiable information about a person’s demographic characteristics gives rise to the possibility of discrimination. Indeed, a growing body of research indicates that P2P market participants discriminate online in much the same ways as they do in traditional markets.====This paper leverages the standardization provided by P2P platforms to measure the effect of host race on listing price on the world’s biggest short-term rental platform, Airbnb. Using data scraped from the Airbnb website, I code the demographic information of 70,000 Airbnb hosts throughout the country. I find that non-White hosts, both male and female, have lower prices than White hosts on the platform.====Previous literature has examined discrimination against Airbnb hosts in various small samples (Edelman, Luca, Wang, Xi, Gilheany, 2015, Kakar, Voelz, Wu, Franco, 2018). All three studies have found evidence of a price disparity for minority hosts of different races. The first study of this kind estimated that non-Black hosts have higher prices than Black hosts in New York City (Edelman and Luca, 2014). Wang et al. (2015) and (Kakar et al., 2018) did not find lower prices for Black hosts, but did find evidence of a price disparity for Asian hosts in San Francisco’s Bay Area.====The comprehensiveness of mitigating controls varies enormously in this literature. Wang et al. (2015) and (Edelman and Luca, 2014) were limited by the sparse listing information available on the Airbnb website (Airbnb has since added more comprehensive listing details). For instance, Edelman and Luca (2014) only control for a few property characteristics, the quality of the host’s reviews, and a measure of the reliability of the host. However, there are still many other observables, such as the type of listing, and unobservables, such as the quality of the host themselves, which could differ by race and contribute to variation in prices.====In sum, no study has measured a price disparity in a large, representative, multi-city sample of Airbnb listings. There exists no research conclusively showing whether or not minority hosts face a price disparity in the nationwide Airbnb market, whether the price disparity differs in magnitude by city, or whether hosts of a certain race fare better in some cities and worse in others. This paper seeks to fill these gaps.====I build on the existing literature in the following ways. First, I bring more robust data than existing studies to the question. My sample includes seven large urban centers that cover each geographic region in the United States. Second, I control for a comprehensive set of confounders that includes all information available to a guest on the listing page. To account for unobservable differences in host quality, I use machine learning techniques to analyze the descriptions on listing pages. These controls comprise the rest of the observable information on the listing page that could influence demand for that listing. Third, I code the demographic characteristics of reviewers in Chicago, to examine whether or not minority hosts have worse reviews, and whether review quality differs by the reviewer’s race. Fourth, I use predictions from basic microeconomic theory, and proxies for the quantity demanded of a listing, to test hypotheses that could explain the price disparity.====I find a negative effect of minority host race on listing prices on Airbnb. My point estimates indicate that the price disparity between White and non-White hosts is widest for Asian hosts. The prices of Asian hosts of both sexes are roughly 4.5% lower than White male hosts who own a property in a similar location with similar characteristics. The second biggest effect is for Black male hosts, whose listed price is lower by around 3%.==== While my coefficients suggest an effect of minority host race on price, the point estimates decrease as I add controls. This raises the question of whether controlling for other unobservables would further decrease the point estimates. In Section 4, I use Oster (2017)’s analysis of selection on unobservables to address this concern.====I also explore whether the price disparity holds in individual cities and across different types of listings. I find that the price disparity is driven by lower-priced, newer listings with few reviews. This finding is consistent with the presence of statistical discrimination, as in the absence of a clear signal about a listing’s quality, a discriminatory guest might use the host race as a proxy for quality. In the main sample that includes all cities, my estimates are smaller than those measured by the previous studies. However, this fact is unsurprising, as it is unlikely that we would measure the same disparity when there are important structural differences between this paper and previous literature in the sample, sample size, and empirical approach.====There are two theoretical reasons that could explain why minority hosts systemically charge lower prices than White hosts for listings of the same quality. The first is that low prices are a response to lower demand for their listings. Throughout the paper, I refer to this as a demand shift, or a demand effect. Statistical discrimination as laid out by Becker (1957) is one explanation for lower demand. In the Airbnb market, if a guest is discriminating, then given two comparable listings they would be willing to pay more to avoid staying in the listing owned by a minority host. Responding to (or anticipating) this lower demand, minority hosts rationally post a lower price.====The second theoretical reason for a lower price is a higher supply of minority host’s listings at each price point. I refer to this as a supply shift, or supply effect. A supply shift could be due to a lower marginal cost of operating the listing for minority hosts relative to White hosts. For instance, minority hosts could charge a lower price for their listing because it is marginally cheaper for them to operate that listing relative to a White host. Since Black and Hispanic workers tend to earn less than their White counterparts, even for the same amount of education, they may have a lower opportunity cost of time (Economic Policy Institute, 2016). They would therefore have a lower marginal cost of managing their listing, and so would set lower prices than White hosts with comparable listings.====Basic microeconomic theory states that the quantity demanded in a market can help differentiate between a demand versus a supply effect. A lower price and lower quantity demanded points to a demand shift, whereas a lower price but higher quantity demanded points to a supply shift. In the context of Airbnb, the true measure of a listing’s quantity demanded would be its number of bookings. However, I do not observe this value in my data. Throughout my analysis, I therefore use two proxies for the number of bookings: the number of reviews of a listing and its vacancy rate. I use these two measures of quantity demanded to address whether the price disparity is caused by a demand or supply effect.====My first measure of quantity demanded is the number of reviews. I find that Black hosts, White female hosts, and Asian female hosts have 5–10% fewer reviews than White hosts for a listing that has spent the same amount of time on the market. Effects for all other host categories are slightly negative, but not statistically significant.====One potential explanation for a lower number of reviews is that a minority host might make their listing available to guests less frequently than a White host. A host controls how many days of the month they offer their listing for rent via an availability calendar on the listing page. When a guest books their listing, the booked days disappear from the availability calendar. Therefore, the availability is actually a measure of the vacancy rate for the listing. If a host has a fewer reviews, perhaps this is because they offer their listing for fewer days of the month. To test this, I regress a listing’s vacancy rate on host race. Results show that contrary to this hypothesis, the listings of Black hosts stay vacant 1.5–2.5 days per month ==== than the listings of White hosts. The listings of White female hosts and Asian female hosts, on the other hand, are vacant slightly less frequently than listings owned by White hosts, meaning that higher vacancy rate could be driving lower review numbers.====In sum, no minority host group has a higher number of reviews than White hosts. This fact provides suggestive evidence that minority hosts’ quantity demanded on Airbnb is ==== not higher than those of White hosts. At least part of the lower number of reviews for Asian females and White females can be explained by differences in availability. Black hosts, on the other hand, have a statistically significant lower number of reviews, but higher availability. Surprisingly, this must mean that consumers do not respond to the lower prices of Black hosts by increasing demand, as the listings of Black hosts have fewer guests and stay vacant for longer than comparable listings operated by White hosts.====A demand shift could also be caused by differences in review quality. Host race could drive differences in reviews because minority hosts are of worse quality, or because discriminatory guests rate minority hosts lower for the same quality of stay. If minority hosts have worse reviews on their listing page, it might decrease demand by discouraging future guests. To this end, I estimate the effect of host race on review quality. I use the race and gender of the reviewer, and the host, to compare the sentiment (how favorable or unfavorable the review is) of the reviews that guests leave for White and for minority hosts.==== I find that Black and Hispanic males have reviews that are 0.1–0.2 standard deviations worse than White male hosts, significant at the ====  < .01 level. Lower quality reviews might explain why the listings of Black host are priced lower, but are also less demanded, than the listings of White male hosts.",The impact of host race and gender on prices on Airbnb,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137718301815,12 August 2019,2019,Research Article,147.0

I find that non-White hosts, both male and female, have lower prices than White hosts on the platform.====Previous literature has examined discrimination against Airbnb hosts in various small samples (Edelman, Luca, Wang, Xi, Gilheany, 2015, Kakar, Voelz, Wu, Franco, 2018). All three studies have found evidence of a price disparity for minority hosts of different races. The first study of this kind estimated that non-Black hosts have higher prices than Black hosts in New York City (Edelman and Luca, 2014). Wang et al. (2015) and (Kakar et al., 2018) did not find lower prices for Black hosts, but did find evidence of a price disparity for Asian hosts in San Francisco’s Bay Area.====The comprehensiveness of mitigating controls varies enormously in this literature. Wang et al. (2015) and (Edelman and Luca, 2014) were limited by the sparse listing information available on the Airbnb website (Airbnb has since added more comprehensive listing details). For instance, Edelman and Luca (2014) only control for a few property characteristics, the quality of the host’s reviews, and a measure of the reliability of the host. However, there are still many other observables, such as the type of listing, and unobservables, such as the quality of the host themselves, which could differ by race and contribute to variation in prices.====In sum, no study has measured a price disparity in a large, representative, multi-city sample of Airbnb listings. There exists no research conclusively showing whether or not minority hosts face a price disparity in the nationwide Airbnb market, whether the price disparity differs in magnitude by city, or whether hosts of a certain race fare better in some cities and worse in others. This paper seeks to fill these gaps.====I build on the existing literature in the following ways. First, I bring more robust data than existing studies to the question. My sample includes seven large urban centers that cover each geographic region in the United States. Second, I control for a comprehensive set of confounders that includes all information available to a guest on the listing page. To account for unobservable differences in host quality, I use machine learning techniques to analyze the descriptions on listing pages. These controls comprise the rest of the observable information on the listing page that could influence demand for that listing. Third, I code the demographic characteristics of reviewers in Chicago, to examine whether or not minority hosts have worse reviews, and whether review quality differs by the reviewer’s race. Fourth, I use predictions from basic microeconomic theory, and proxies for the quantity demanded of a listing, to test hypotheses that could explain the price disparity.====I find a negative effect of minority host race on listing prices on Airbnb. My point estimates indicate that the price disparity between White and non-White hosts is widest for Asian hosts. The prices of Asian hosts of both sexes are roughly 4.5% lower than White male hosts who own a property in a similar location with similar characteristics. The second biggest effect is for Black male hosts, whose listed price is lower by around 3%.==== While my coefficients suggest an effect of minority host race on price, the point estimates decrease as I add controls. This raises the question of whether controlling for other unobservables would further decrease the point estimates. In Section 4, I use Oster (2017)’s analysis of selection on unobservables to address this concern.====I also explore whether the price disparity holds in individual cities and across different types of listings. I find that the price disparity is driven by lower-priced, newer listings with few reviews. This finding is consistent with the presence of statistical discrimination, as in the absence of a clear signal about a listing’s quality, a discriminatory guest might use the host race as a proxy for quality. In the main sample that includes all cities, my estimates are smaller than those measured by the previous studies. However, this fact is unsurprising, as it is unlikely that we would measure the same disparity when there are important structural differences between this paper and previous literature in the sample, sample size, and empirical approach.====There are two theoretical reasons that could explain why minority hosts systemically charge lower prices than White hosts for listings of the same quality. The first is that low prices are a response to lower demand for their listings. Throughout the paper, I refer to this as a demand shift, or a demand effect. Statistical discrimination as laid out by Becker (1957) is one explanation for lower demand. In the Airbnb market, if a guest is discriminating, then given two comparable listings they would be willing to pay more to avoid staying in the listing owned by a minority host. Responding to (or anticipating) this lower demand, minority hosts rationally post a lower price.====The second theoretical reason for a lower price is a higher supply of minority host’s listings at each price point. I refer to this as a supply shift, or supply effect. A supply shift could be due to a lower marginal cost of operating the listing for minority hosts relative to White hosts. For instance, minority hosts could charge a lower price for their listing because it is marginally cheaper for them to operate that listing relative to a White host. Since Black and Hispanic workers tend to earn less than their White counterparts, even for the same amount of education, they may have a lower opportunity cost of time (Economic Policy Institute, 2016). They would therefore have a lower marginal cost of managing their listing, and so would set lower prices than White hosts with comparable listings.====Basic microeconomic theory states that the quantity demanded in a market can help differentiate between a demand versus a supply effect. A lower price and lower quantity demanded points to a demand shift, whereas a lower price but higher quantity demanded points to a supply shift. In the context of Airbnb, the true measure of a listing’s quantity demanded would be its number of bookings. However, I do not observe this value in my data. Throughout my analysis, I therefore use two proxies for the number of bookings: the number of reviews of a listing and its vacancy rate. I use these two measures of quantity demanded to address whether the price disparity is caused by a demand or supply effect.====My first measure of quantity demanded is the number of reviews. I find that Black hosts, White female hosts, and Asian female hosts have 5–10% fewer reviews than White hosts for a listing that has spent the same amount of time on the market. Effects for all other host categories are slightly negative, but not statistically significant.====One potential explanation for a lower number of reviews is that a minority host might make their listing available to guests less frequently than a White host. A host controls how many days of the month they offer their listing for rent via an availability calendar on the listing page. When a guest books their listing, the booked days disappear from the availability calendar. Therefore, the availability is actually a measure of the vacancy rate for the listing. If a host has a fewer reviews, perhaps this is because they offer their listing for fewer days of the month. To test this, I regress a listing’s vacancy rate on host race. Results show that contrary to this hypothesis, the listings of Black hosts stay vacant 1.5–2.5 days per month ==== than the listings of White hosts. The listings of White female hosts and Asian female hosts, on the other hand, are vacant slightly less frequently than listings owned by White hosts, meaning that higher vacancy rate could be driving lower review numbers.====In sum, no minority host group has a higher number of reviews than White hosts. This fact provides suggestive evidence that minority hosts’ quantity demanded on Airbnb is ==== not higher than those of White hosts. At least part of the lower number of reviews for Asian females and White females can be explained by differences in availability. Black hosts, on the other hand, have a statistically significant lower number of reviews, but higher availability. Surprisingly, this must mean that consumers do not respond to the lower prices of Black hosts by increasing demand, as the listings of Black hosts have fewer guests and stay vacant for longer than comparable listings operated by White hosts.====A demand shift could also be caused by differences in review quality. Host race could drive differences in reviews because minority hosts are of worse quality, or because discriminatory guests rate minority hosts lower for the same quality of stay. If minority hosts have worse reviews on their listing page, it might decrease demand by discouraging future guests. To this end, I estimate the effect of host race on review quality. I use the race and gender of the reviewer, and the host, to compare the sentiment (how favorable or unfavorable the review is) of the reviews that guests leave for White and for minority hosts.==== I find that Black and Hispanic males have reviews that are 0.1–0.2 standard deviations worse than White male hosts, significant at the ====  < .01 level. Lower quality reviews might explain why the listings of Black host are priced lower, but are also less demanded, than the listings of White male hosts.",The impact of host race and gender on prices on Airbnb,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137718301815,12 August 2019,2019,Research Article,148.0

We explore the extent to which this trend may have contributed to gentrification. Using confidential census microdata, we show that reductions in central city violent crime are associated with increases in the probability that high-income and college-educated households move into central city neighborhoods, including low-income neighborhoods, instead of the suburbs. We then use neighborhood-level crime and home purchase data for five major U.S. cities and find that falling neighborhood crime is associated with increasing numbers and shares of high-income movers choosing low-income central city neighborhoods.","Violent crime has fallen dramatically in the United States. From 1991 to 2012, the national violent crime rate fell by 49%, and it fell even more in central cities and low-income, urban neighborhoods in particular (Ellen and O'Regan, 2009, Sharkey, 2018). The latter part of this time period also saw growing proportions of high-income, college-educated, and white households moving into central city neighborhoods, a process referred to as gentrification (Couture and Handbury, 2017; Baum-Snow and Hartley, 2017). Understanding whether falling crime has invited gentrification is important for understanding the long-term implications of enhancing public safety for segregation, city finances, and housing prices. If falling central city violent crime has helped unleash demand among higher income households for central cities that was previously masked by aversion to violent crime, then American cities could grow to look more like Paris and less like Detroit (Brueckner et al., 1999).====We empirically examine the relationship between falling crime and gentrification using three complementary approaches that leverage geographically precise neighborhood choice data. For the first two approaches, we use confidential, geocoded individual microdata from the 2000 Decennial Census and the 2010–2012 ACS for residents of more than 200 of the largest metropolitan areas in the U.S. We restrict the sample to household heads who moved within the past year.==== For each individual in each survey year, we observe his or her block of residence as well as demographic characteristics such as income, race, education level, and tenure status. We merge these individual data with the time-varying demographic, housing, and economic characteristics of the central city and suburbs of their metropolitan area (Core-Based Statistical Area, or CBSA).==== Finally, we add central city and suburban violent crime rates from the Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) makes public.====Using these data, we first examine the links between falling rates of violent crime in central cities and the composition of households choosing to live in those cities. Estimating linear probability models that control for metropolitan area fixed effects as well as time-varying individual and metropolitan area characteristics, we find that from 2000 to 2010–2012, larger declines in central city violent crime are associated with larger increases in the probability that gentrifiers (high-income, college-educated, and white households) choose the central city over the suburbs. While the association is modest, it is significant and robust. Importantly, falling city crime is not associated with changes in the probability that low-income, less-educated, or non-white households move to the central city, suggesting that falling central city violent crime may have affected the ==== of the types of individual choosing the central city over the suburbs.====To examine whether falling city crime has contributed to the gentrification of ==== central city neighborhoods in particular, we estimate multinomial logit models that distinguish among moves to the suburbs, to high-income central city neighborhoods, and to low-income central city neighborhoods. We again find that falling city crime is associated with compositional shifts: while greater reductions in central city violent crime are linked to larger increases in the probability that higher income, college educated, or white households choose low-income central city neighborhoods instead of the suburbs, we find no such relationship for lower-income, non-college educated, or minority movers.====Finally, we consider the implications of changes in ====-level violence on neighborhood choices in five major U.S. cities (Austin, Chicago, Philadelphia, Seattle, and Washington, D.C.) for the years 1998–2010.==== We use Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data to capture neighborhood choices. We aggregate home purchases to create tract-level changes in the number of high- and low-income homebuyers from 2000 to 2010, which we merge with tract-level changes in violent crime for the same period. Regressions again suggest that falling neighborhood violent crime is associated with increases in the number of high-income homebuyers, and that these relationships are stronger for high-income buyers than for low-income buyers.====In sum, across multiple geographies and datasets, we find robust associations between falling levels of violence and the mix of households opting for cities and for low-income city neighborhoods in particular. While we cannot pinpoint the direction of causality, several mechanisms could explain why reductions in violence would contribute to a changing composition of residents. First, safety itself is an amenity, so improvements in safety make cities more attractive. If high-status individuals are willing to pay more for safety than lower-status individuals, this will contribute to an increase in the share of movers to safer areas who are high-status. O'Sullivan (2005) describes a monocentric model with these features. Second, the reduction in central city violent crime could affect residential choices by “revealing” central city amenities that were there all along (Albouy et al., 2018). If these amenities are more valued by higher-status individuals, this will also create an increase in the share of movers who are high-income. This mechanism is consistent with the monocentric model with amenities developed by Brueckner et al. (1999). Finally, the reduction in violent crime could initially attract some higher status individuals to the central city, which then leads to an endogenous increase in amenities enjoyed by these households, further attracting higher status households (Diamond, 2016, Couture and Handbury, 2017, Su, 2018). While the reduction in violent crime plays more of a supporting role in these latter stories, it provides the initial impetus.",Has falling crime invited gentrification?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137719300658,16 July 2019,2019,Research Article,149.0

Therefore, budget-neutral labor tax wedge reductions to foster economic performance and international competitiveness rank high on the agenda in many euro area economies (see European Commission, 2013, European Commission, 2014, European Commission, 2015, European Commission, 2016). Following much discussion in the literature, which we will review below, shifting the tax burden away from direct labor to less distortive indirect consumption taxation has been suggested as a politically viable option to reap the economic benefits of labor tax wedge reductions.====Another option that has recently gained some attention is the shift towards higher property taxation (inter alia OECD, 2012, OECD, 2015 and IMF, 2014, provide an overview of the debate). The arguments in favor of such a shift are based on findings in the literature on optimal tax policy, which show that it is most efficient to tax objects with a rather immobile base and where tax-induced distortions are kept at minimum – conditions that are apparently fulfilled for property goods (see, among others, Mankiw, Weinzierl, Yagan, 2009, Feldstein, 2006, Slemrod, 1990, or Diamond et al., 1971). Bielecki and Stähler (2018) show in a recent paper that property taxation can indeed marginally outperform consumption taxation as the financing instrument to finance a labor tax wedge reduction.====As is discussed by Surico and Trezzi (2015) as well as Paetzold and Tiefenbacher (2016) in microeconomic simulation studies for Italy and Germany, respectively, it is very likely that a change in property tax legislation will create winners and losers. Different types of property-related taxes, such as recurrent property taxes, property acquisition taxes, tax credits on mortgage interest or taxes on rental income from providing housing services, may affect different groups in the economy, such as homeowners with and without mortgages or renters, quite differently. Given that everyone needs housing, property tax legislation is therefore an important issue, also for the general public. Hence, it would appear crucial to identify who gains and who loses under which circumstances and to what extent from using property taxes to finance a labor tax wedge reduction.====Our paper contributes to this discussion by means of a New Keynesian two-country monetary union DSGE model characterized by a frictional labor market, a comprehensive fiscal block that includes a wide range of taxes and disaggregation of government spending as well as a complex housing market structure that takes account of the households’ decision whether to buy or rent housing services. These elements have, to our knowledge, not yet been combined within one model. Therefore, this can be seen as a methodological contribution of the paper. The model is calibrated to core and periphery Europe. Some households are liquidity-constrained and face a borrowing limit. There are three different types of housing-related taxes: a property acquisition tax on house purchases, a recurrent property tax on the housing stock and a tax on rental income from providing housing rental services. In addition, we also allow for a tax credit on mortgage interest payments in line with the legislation of most European economies and for tax credits related to property tax payments. Furthermore, a frictional labor market to capture the labor market effects of a labor tax wedge reduction is included.====As expected, a reduction in the labor tax wedge has positive employment, demand and output effects. Also, international competitiveness increases via the marginal cost channel and the aggregate demand for housing services rises as a result of the increase in net labor income. Spillovers to the non-reforming region are positive due to higher demand in the reforming region compensating for the increase in competitiveness. This holds independent of the financing instrument used.====When using higher consumption taxation as the financing instrument, these positive effects are indeed dampened due to the policy-induced price increase for consumption goods. However, they are not overturned because taxing consumption is less distortive than taxing labor. This has been extensively discussed in the literature, which we discuss below.====Using property taxation to finance a labor tax wedge reduction has similar positive effects from an overall macroeconomic perspective. Because of a lack of policy-induced price increase for regular consumption goods, both household types are able to increase private consumption more compared to a situation in which consumption taxes finance the labor tax wedge reduction (albeit to different degrees). Not surprisingly, however, housing and/or rental markets are negatively affected, which generates changes in tenure status, changes in the composition of GDP and the redistribution of consumption and housing between household types. It not only does it become less attractive for borrowers to become homeowners (except for the simulation in which taxes on rental income disproportionately increase rental prices) but also borrowers tend to rent fewer housing services (except for the simulation in which property acquisition taxes are raised). Aggregate labor market effects are still very similar independent of the property tax instrument used. What changes is the employment composition across sectors (regular versus housing goods).====An increase in private consumption and a fall in housing affect utility of households in opposite ways. Furthermore, consumption gains and housing losses are dependent on the financing instrument used. This makes it difficult to answer the question which measure is “better” or “worse”. Our theoretical model allows us to provide a model-consistent answer to this question. Simulations suggest that financing the decrease in the labor tax wedge using property acquisition taxes outperforms all other financing instruments, including consumption taxation. This stems from the fact that we allow households to purchase or rent housing services. Even though home ownership for borrowers falls, they rent more housing services such that housing utility does not fall disproportionately. In that ranking, the use of recurrent property and consumption taxes closely follow the use of property acquisition taxes. Increasing rental income taxation seems to be the least favorable tax instrument, and abandoning tax credit on mortgage interest payments effectively harms borrowers because of the relatively high increase in mortgage costs.====These welfare results should, however, not be interpreted as an in-depth contribution to the optimal taxation literature. Our model abstracts from heterogeneity in (labor) income and ability, which would be needed for an analysis of tax policies’ effects on income distribution. Also, by taxing income of borrowers and savers at a flat rate, the model does not consider a social welfare function that gives importance to inequality concerns. The presented welfare ranking is, therefore, not a ==== optimal policy. Rather, it should be understood as a ranking that helps evaluating the different effects that the tax policies have on changes in consumption and housing purchases in our specific framework. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of including a housing rental market to assess these different policies.====Having said this, our simulations suggest that the use of property taxation can outperform the use of consumption taxation to finance budget-neutral labor tax wedge reductions. Related to the discussions on budget-neutral labor tax reductions, which we discuss in the literature review below, property taxes should therefore be considered as one possible instrument. Furthermore, based on the argument of reduced labor mobility (van Ommeren and van Leuvensteijn, 2005), the IMF (2014) argues property acquisition taxes are a rather inefficient tax instrument. Our simulations however suggest that, to finance a labor tax cut, it may not be as bad as presumed by the IMF (2014). In that respect, our paper should be understood as a first step towards assessing these tax policies. Further research with a special focus on inequality certainly seems to be in order.",Who benefits from using property taxes to finance a labor tax wedge reduction?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137718302845,4 July 2019,2019,Research Article,150.0

We study the effects of housing taxation in a model with search and matching frictions in the property market and a competitive rental market. We show a new transmission channel of a housing ==== not only through the change in the user cost but also via the impact on housing rental services, as measured by the rental prices. We calibrate the model in order to estimate the effects of the recent Italian housing market taxation reforms and the extent of property taxes capitalization in ====. We show that property taxation on owner-occupied dwellings has a negative effect on property and rental prices, whereas taxes on secondary homes have qualitative opposite effects. The simultaneous increase of both these instruments may mitigate the dynamics of prices and rents as well as the change of the ratio between the share of owners and renters, determining a partial capitalization of taxation on prices.","In many countries property taxes are one of the main components of total tax revenues, especially for local governments (Norregaard, 2013). Among them, a special role is played by recurrent taxation on dwellings, both for its prominent contribution to the overall property tax revenues and their implications for household tenure choice. Regarding the latter, the effects of property taxes on homeownership through their impact on the user cost of owner-occupation have been extensively documented (Poterba, 1992). At the same time, there was much debate about the effects on house prices: this relationship is particularly relevant, and it is the main research question underlying this paper.====House prices dynamics affects both the real economy and the financial system through different channels. House prices changes affect households consumption, as they entail an appreciation or depreciation households real wealth (Mian et al., 2013). An upturn of house prices provides support to the output in the constructions sector, as firms find more profitable to build new houses (Glaeser and Gyourko, 2005). Macroprudential authorities devote a lot of attention to house prices evolution, as they affect the quality of financial intermediaries balance sheets through their role as collateral. In this respect, in recent years property taxation has been introduced in some cities in China as a tool to dampen the sharp increase in house prices (Du and Zhang, 2015).====The potential link between real estate property taxes and house prices has been so far assessed almost exclusively from an asset-pricing perspective. In equilibrium the price of a house is equal to the present discounted value of its future service stream, represented by its real rental service value minus the user cost of owning a home. The latter represents the link between property taxes and house prices (Yinger, 1982, Poterba, 1984). A large volume of empirical literature starting with Oates (1969) has analyzed if increasing property taxes affect house prices negatively and to which extent. There is a broad consensus about tax capitalization into prices, although this literature fails to agree about its extent. Regarding the US, according to Yinger et al. (1988) the extent of tax capitalization is between 15 and 30%, while using a different sample and an econometric approach Palmon and Smith (1998) estimate 60% and cannot statistically reject the hypothesis of full capitalization. The main reason why the estimation of tax capitalization is cumbersome lies on the several issues that researchers must tackle in the empirical analysis. Firstly, there can be reverse causality (from prices to tax rates) when the local governments target a fixed amount of tax revenues, as higher house values allow to impose lower tax rates. Secondly, when property taxes are used to finance local public services, a higher tax rate could be associated with higher prices because of the better quality of public goods. Moreover, taxation specifics other than tax rates, such as the preferential treatment for particular classes of dwellings, should also be taken into account, as they can bring significant nonlinearities in the effects of property taxation on house prices (Bai et al., 2014).====In this paper we address the issue of property tax capitalization through a calibrated search and matching model, focusing on the effects of property taxation on house prices and the structure of the housing market in Italy. We depart from Wheaton (1990) by explicitly including an active rental market with endogenous demand and supply in order to consider the household tenure choice. That means that we allow for endogenous participation from both the demand and the supply side of the rental market, without recurring to the standard simplifying assumptions considered in the literature. Our modeling choices are motivated by the fact that in Italy about 90% of the housing stock is own by households. As a consequence, any policy evaluation exercise cannot ignore the fact that landlords belong to the households sector and the decision to rent out instead to sell has to be explicitly considered.====According to our calibration, an increase of property taxes on owner-occupied houses harms housing demand and prices, as standard in the literature. On the other hand, the opposite effect results from an increase of property taxes on secondary dwellings, as landlords shift part of the tax burden on tenants through higher rents. That makes homeownership relatively more convenient, and in the steady-state equilibrium this implies higher housing prices.====We use our model to estimate the extent to which property taxes are capitalized on housing prices in Italy. We find that property taxes are partially capitalized, although our estimates point to a significant degree of capitalization. Differently from the previous literature, we can show that partial capitalization emerges because of the simultaneous working of the two mechanisms described above. While the impact on prices of an increase of taxation on owner-occupied dwellings is significantly negative, the same percentage point increase of tax rates on second homes leads to a slight rise of house prices that reduces the extent of tax capitalization. At the same time rental prices increase, in line with the results of Tsoodle and Turner (2008). Loosely speaking, in our model property taxation affects house prices not only through the change in the user cost, as stressed by the previous empirical literature, but also via the impact on housing rental services, as measured by the rental prices.====We employ our model for an evaluation of the real estate property tax reform adopted in Italy in 2011. The fiscal legislation in Italy has always allowed for different tax rates among owner-occupied houses and other dwellings, encouraging homeownership. Between 2008 and 2011 owner-occupied houses were exempted entirely from property taxes, but in 2012 taxation was restored. At the same time, the tax burden on secondary homes was raised further. We find that the property tax reform approved at the end of 2011 would have made house prices decreasing by 1.3% and rents increasing by 6.0% in real terms.====The peculiarities of the housing market motivate our choice to resort to a search and matching approach. Trade is not instantaneous, despite there are simultaneously many buyers and sellers: potential buyers need a substantial period in order to find and buy a home they like, while sellers have to wait several weeks before they can sell their home. That happens because houses are heterogeneous goods and they are traded in a market characterized by significant uncertainty regarding trading opportunities. Consequently, as the assumption of instantaneous and costless coordination of trade is not suitable, the Walrasian paradigm seems inadequate to describe this market and a growing literature is resorting to search and matching models: buyers and sellers should search for each other until they find a trading opportunity that satisfies both parties.====Search theory is not only more appropriate from a theoretical point of view but, as shown by many authors, it rationalizes several stylized facts of the housing markets: the observed natural vacancy rate (Wheaton, 1990), price momentum (Head et al., 2014) and seasonality of house prices (Ngai and Tenreyro, 2014), the correlation of prices with sales and time on market (Diaz and Jerez, 2013). Search and matching models have also been used to analyze the effects of transactions taxes (Lundborg and Skedinger, 1999).====The seminal contribution in this literature was provided by Wheaton (1990). In that model households buy and sell dwellings in a decentralized housing market subject to search frictions. Each family derives a flow utility from living in a house she likes. Due to an idiosyncratic preference shock, a household becomes uncomfortable with its home and starts looking for a new one, incurring in a costly search effort. Once a new dwelling is found, the household move in the new location and put the previous home on sale; market prices are determined on a bilateral basis by Nash bargaining.==== Our main contribution is to extend the basic framework of Wheaton (1990) including a fully specified rental market with endogenous rent prices and explicitly modeling the tenure choice. Also other papers in this literature feature a rental market, but differently from us it is generally modeled as a reservation state for unmatched buyers (Diaz and Jerez, 2013), or there is no trade-off for owners between renting or searching for buyers (Moen et al., 2015). Regarding the latter, Krainer (2001) shows that allowing sellers to rent out while they are searching for a buyer has dramatic consequences on the equilibrium as it cancels out the frictions associated with housing market illiquidity. The most exhaustive treatment of the rental market in a search model is provided by Halket and di Custoza (2015). In their model both the rental and the owner-occupied markets are treated as a competitive search economy, but in order to keep the model tractable the supply side (landlords and house builders) is exogenous to the household sector. As we said above, we believe that this modeling choice is not appropriate when the housing stock in the economy is owned almost entirely by the household sector.====A different model-based approach to the housing tenure choice is provided by Sommer et al. (2013). They present a heterogeneous agents dynamic general equilibrium model with markets for homeownership and rental properties and assume credit frictions rather than search frictions. The most related contributions to our work in this literature are Gervais (2002) and Sommer and Sullivan (2018). Both papers consider the effects of the preferential tax treatment of homeownership in the US. In Gervais (2002) repealing the mortgage interest deduction leads to a decline in homeownership because it increases the cost of ownership but does not reduce downpayment requirements (because house prices are kept fixed). In Sommer and Sullivan (2018), where both house prices and rents are allowed to adjust, a reduction in the tax deductions available to homeowners leads to a decline in house prices because of the higher user cost. That allows low-wealth households to become homeowners because of the lower downpayment required. Moreover, as rents remain roughly constant while house prices decline, the positive effect on homeownership reinforces, because it becomes cheaper relative to renting. The relevance of tax credits as a tool of the joint endogenous determination of house prices and rents is also stressed by Floetotto et al. (2016) that suggest as homebuyer tax deductions in the presence of differences tax treatment of owner-occupied and rental housing temporarily raise house prices and transactions bearing negative welfare effects. Like the previous works we focus on the general equilibrium effects of housing and rental taxation on homeownership, prices and rents. However, we depart from the previous contributions for what concerns the mechanism which determines our findings: in our model, since the wealthier landlords can shift part of the tax burden to the tenants, the demand for second houses increases only if the second home is taxed.====The paper is structured as follows.

Specifically, we apply the theory of natural expectations, proposed by Fuster et al. (2010), to show that biased expectations on the two sides of the credit market have been a key determinant of the surge in households’ leverage but also that inaccurate long-run expectations on behalf of financial intermediaries are a necessary - yet so far overlooked - ingredient for matching the observed debt dynamics.","From 1999 to the end of 2006, U.S. household debt relative to income grew sharply, from 64% to more than 100 %.==== A strong appreciation in housing prices accompanied the increase in debt: the Standard & Poor’s Case-Shiller Home Price Index soared by 65 % in real terms in the same time span. Unlike previous episodes of heated housing markets, this housing price boom has been characterized by a surge in households’ home equity extraction (HEE), through cash-out refinancing of mortgages, second lien home equity loans, or home equity lines of credit (HELOCs). In 1992 the value of HEE was about $41 billion (in 2006 dollars); at the end of 1999 it more than doubled to about $95 billion; and from 2000 to 2006, when housing price growth was at its peak, HEE almost tripled (Fig. 1).==== Also, Greenspan and Kennedy (2005) document that households’ gross home equity extraction as a fraction of disposable income increased from less than 3% to about 10% between 1997 and 2005.====One of the explanations provided in the literature for the large increase in household debt during the house price boom is related to the inability of households to make sound financial decisions when exposed to housing-related financial products. The explanations for such behavior range from money illusion (Brunnermeier and Julliard 2008), to limited financial literacy (Gerardi et al. 2010 and Lusardi and Tufano 2015), and to inability to accurately forecast house prices (Goodman and Ittner 1992). However, while the literature has focused on the behavior of agents on the demand side of the debt market, little has been said about the role of agents on the supply side.====In this paper we propose a framework in which (i) the availability of financial instruments allows agents to borrow today against the future expected value of their houses; and (ii) both households and financial intermediaries can be subject to inaccurate long-run house price expectations. We show that biased expectations on the two sides of the housing-related credit market adequately explained the surge in households’ leverage during the 2000s housing price boom, but also that, more importantly, inaccurate long-run expectations on behalf of financial intermediaries are a necessary - yet so far overlooked - ingredient for matching the observed debt dynamics. This finding is consistent with the evidence provided in Kaplan et al. (2017) and in Bailey et al. (2017), which, using a different approach than ours to capture optimism, show that the increased leverage observed in the early 2000s relied on lenders’ optimism.====Our framework is based on the concept of ====, first described in Fuster et al. (2010) and Fuster et al. (2012). When talking about ====, these papers describe the following setting: consider an economy where after a shock (1) fundamentals are hump-shaped, exhibiting momentum in the short run and partial mean reversion in the long run, which, however, is hard to identify in small samples; and (2) agents do not know that fundamentals are hump-shaped; instead, base their beliefs on too parsimonious models that fit the available data, thus generating inaccurate long-run predictions. Hence agents will end up overestimating the persistence of economic shocks. We apply such concept to the housing-credit market, assuming that our economy’s homeowners take housing prices as given; they derive long-run house price forecasts in order to quantify their future housing wealth and to decide how much equity to extract. Similarly, financial intermediaries need to forecast future house prices to choose the supply of home equity loans. The assumption that households behave in line with the ==== expectations theory when confronting house prices is largely supported by empirical work. For example, Goodman and Ittner (1992) surveys the early literature about the optimism of homeowners in assessing the future values of their homes and documents that households overestimate home prices by 4 to 16 %. Using survey data in the period 2002–2012, Case et al. (2012) find that households’ forecasts under-predicted actual realizations in the short-run (one year) but were “abnormally high” in the long run (10 years).====Similar evidence has been documented in Shiller (2007) and Benítez-Silva et al. (2015). A further strand of literature has also highlighted the interaction between optimistic forecasts and households’ borrowing, which may give rise to belief-driven housing cycles (Kuang 2014).====Nevertheless, households are only one side of the housing-related debt market. In fact, financial institutions supply credit to households and, if they did not share the same optimistic forecasts, they would be reluctant to provide home equity loans at low interest rates. Hence, a key contribution of this paper is to show that in order to replicate the dynamics of boom-bust episodes like the one recently observed in the U.S., one needs also ==== expectations on behalf of financial intermediaries, in the sense that they, too, had to ignore any form of long-run mean reversion in housing prices after the positive and strong short-run momentum.==== Seen from a different perspective, the main claim of the paper is that in order for optimistic beliefs to be the only explanation for the large increase in household leverage, they need to be shared by both households and banks.====Treating financial institutions as ==== agents is coherent with other studies about the behavior of housing market experts during the boom phase. More precisely, Foote et al. (2012) show that industry analysts and economists were on average optimistic about housing price dynamics and that such beliefs were not without consequence, as those who originated and securitized mortgages incurred in significant losses and even “the executives most likely to understand the subprime-lending process had made personal investment decisions that exposed them to subprime risk” (p. 19). Gerardi et al. (2008) examine market reports before the crisis and show that, during the boom phase, ev en sophisticated analysts (ie. those that understood the risks) displayed over-optimism regarding house price appreciation. A similar finding is also in Cheng et al. (2014), where the authors show that, during the boom, securitization investors and issuers increased their housing exposure, thus revealing that they were not aware of a bust phase coming. Interestingly, the authors also find that those experts perceived the increase in their incomes, which were intrinsically related to the dynamics of the housing market as permanent. Finally, Barberis (2013) points at the adoption of poor statistical models by financial intermediaries as one of the possible causes of the excessive lending recorded during the house price boom. We take stock of the empirical findings of this literature and investigate the effects of optimistic beliefs on financial intermediaries in a theoretical model populated with households and banks. In other words, we build upon the empirical evidence gathered in the above mentioned papers with the aim of singling out the impact on the debt market of lenders’ expectations from those of the households. We then combine the findings of both the literature on households’ expectations and the one on lenders’ and study them in a unified framework. At the same time, we do not attempt at investigating where these optimistic beliefs are originated from: they may indeed arise from bounded rationality or psychological biases of bank managers as well as from short-sighted incentives or from the actual use of bad forecasting models. From our point of view, these explanations are observationally equivalent as they all lead agents on the supply side of the credit market not to adequately take into account the long-run behavior of the statistical objects they form their expectations upon. When applied to banks, the theory of ==== expectations provides an appealing microfoundation to the increased supply of credit during the boom phase, which has been documented in reduced form in Justiniano et al. (2014) via what the authors label as an easing of the ====. At the same time, the literature has brought forward alternative explanations for the surge in home equity extraction in the US housing market at the beginning of the century. In particular, Hurst and Stafford (2004), Calem et al. (2011) and Chen et al. (2013) suggest that such behavior has been driven by a precautionary saving motive of liquidity constrained households. Compared to these papers, where borrowing is induced by the willingness to smooth consumption in the face of income uncertainty, we take a different stance in many respects. First and foremost, we claim that home equity extraction does not arise due to precautionary savings across the cycle; rather, during a boom the most natural households in the model predict a permanent increase in housing wealth. Their borrowing motive is thus related to the willingness to consume today the expected increase in wealth that will occur in the future. Second, we do not deal with income risk. On the other hand, we explicitly model the role of financial intermediaries, a feature that is less emphasized in the above cited papers. Hence, we aim at capturing the determinants of borrowing trends that last much longer than a standard business cycle and are instead related to the lower frequency dynamics of financial cycles (see Drehmann et al. 2012). In this respect, while acknowledging that multiple explanations for the surge in home equity extraction can cohexist, we restrict our analysis to a simple and coherent framework of ==== expectations on both sides of the debt market that replicates fairly accurately the bubbly dynamics observed in the US housing market. Ultimately, we deem that multiple explanations can cohexist to explain the rise in home equity extraction.====The first step in the paper consists then in showing that housing prices are characterized by hump-shaped dynamics, which imply a large momentum in the short run and partial mean reversion in the long run. Thus, we compare four different statistical models to estimate and forecast housing price dynamics. First, we consider two possible dimensions that lead to ==== expectations: (1) an inner tendency of agents to incorporate a small set of explanatory variables when estimating a model, in line with the findings in Beshears et al. (2013); and (2) a limited ability of agents to consider a large set of data when estimating the model, in line with the assumption of extrapolative expectations applied to the housing market.==== We compare the performance of these models with the ones of two rigorous and more sophisticated statistical approaches to modeling and forecasting housing prices, which differ in the information criterion used to select the most appropriate specification. We find that models that incorporate hump-shaped dynamics are not preferred, in terms of in-sample fit, to more parsimonious models that ignore long-run mean reversion. As a result, the use of simple models leading to natural expectations is fully justifiable in terms of in-sample performance. However, we demonstrate that models that have diverse degrees of ability to capture hump-shaped dynamics in housing prices, while leading to comparable short-run predictions, may generate a wide range of long-run forecasts. Hence, from an in-sample fit perspective, it is legitimate for agents to make use of relatively simple models; the drawback however is that in this way they fail to take into account the partial mean reversion of housing prices in the long run.====The second contribution of the paper is to link long-run housing price forecasts to the optimal behavior of agents in the credit market. We therefore introduce a tractable model of a collateralized credit market populated by a representative household and a representative bank. The household can obtain credit from the bank by pledging its house as collateral.==== In each period, the household decides how much to consume and how much to borrow and, given the realization of the stochastic exogenous housing price, whether to repay its debt or to default and lose the ownership of the house. The amount of debt demanded crucially depends on the expected realizations of the housing price. The bank borrows resources at a prime rate and lends them to the household charging a margin. The bank gains either from debt repayment, in the case of no default from the household, or from the sale of the housing stock, in the case of default. Obviously, the banks’ expected future house price is a key determinant of its supply of credit.====In our quantitative assessment, we are mainly interested in examining the extent to which the equilibrium level of debt and its price vary with the ability of agents to take into account possible long run mean-reverting dynamics of housing prices. Hence, we select a housing price path in our model that matches the observed dynamics of the aggregate U.S. housing price in the period 2001–2010, and we vary the specification of the process the agents use to predict future house prices. We consider a large set of specifications (fifty) that are identical in terms of the short-run (one-year ahead) forecast, and in terms of magnitude of the unconditional variance of the housing price process, but that differ in terms of the long-run expectations. Hence, we can rank the different specifications according to their degree of ====: more ==== processes ignore the long-run mean reversion of housing prices and predict a higher long-run price; less ==== processes incorporate a certain degree of housing price adjustment after the short-run momentum and predict a lower long-run price. We obtain four results. First, the theoretical model predicts a positive relationship between the average equilibrium level of debt in the economy in the boom phase and the degree of ==== of agents. Intuitively, after observing an increase in the house price, a more ==== agent (either a household or a bank) expects a long-lasting housing price appreciation, which gives her strong incentives to demand/supply debt. Second, long-run expectations play a large role from a quantitative point of view: when the economy is populated by more ==== agents, the debt-to-income ratio during a boom phase is about 55 %; when the economy is populated by less ==== agents it falls to 35 %. Recall that the difference in these quantities is solely due to the contrasting long-run expectations on housing prices, since by construction agents have the same short-run expectations in each of the fifty specifications. Third, using data on Gross Home Equity Extraction as computed in Greenspan and Kennedy (2005), we show that the simulated process that better fits the observed debt dynamics during the 2000–2009 episode is characterized by a rather high degree of ====. Finally, we show that ==== on the supply-side is particularly relevant for explaining the surge in leverage and for the interest rate reduction on home equity loans observed during the housing price boom. In fact, by conducting simple experiments where only the bank or the household (or both) are natural, we highlight that banks’ ==== has a larger effect than that of households on the equilibrium level of debt in the economy.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we discuss the properties of ==== expectations and their implications for long-run housing price forecasts. In Section 3 we describe the theoretical model, and in Section 4 we describe its calibration. In Section 5 we discuss the quantitative results of the model. Section 6 concludes and summarizes the main findings.",Natural expectations and home equity extraction,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137718300160,6 May 2019,2019,Research Article,152.0

One major concern is the impact of immigration on housing. We assemble a comprehensive database of 474 estimates of immigration's impact on ==== in 14 destination countries and find that immigration increases ====, in the aggregate. The effect of immigration is larger at the province (state) level as it is at the city level. However, using data from the World Values Survey, we also show that attitudes to immigrants moderate this effect. In countries less welcoming to immigrants, house price increases are more limited.","The global stock of immigrants more than tripled between 1960 and 2015, from 72 million to 243 million, respectively (World Bank, 2018). Three percent of the world's population are now immigrants. This wave of immigration has attracted researchers from numerous disciplines, including medicine, economics, political science, and sociology (Clark et al., 2015, Abramitzky and Boustan, 2017, Hassan, 2017). Migration is one of the most pressing social, economic and political issues, generating heated debates in countries facing large influxes of immigrants (Saiz and Wachter, 2011, Accetturo et al., 2014, Abramitzky and Boustan, 2017).====One particular dimension of this debate is the impact of immigration on house prices. Some authors predict that house prices fall following waves of immigration, while others postulate price rises (Sá, 2015, Mussa et al., 2017). Immigration increases the demand for housing and rental accommodation, but it might also affect amenities and the perceived desirability of the neighborhoods most affected (Accetturo et al., 2014). The social interactions between native and foreign born is particularly important (Saiz and Wachter, 2011, Accetturo et al., 2014, Sá, 2015).====Geographical aggregation and area size may affect the relationship between immigration and house prices. In small local housing markets, immigration may increase house prices directly by increasing demand. Alternatively, house prices may fall through indirect local resident out-migration, and the income effect that ensues (Saiz and Wachter, 2011, Sá, 2015, Mussa et al., 2017). Or, house prices may grow at a slower pace because the areas most impacted are deemed to be less desirable. In larger areas, indirect effects are likely to be muted while direct demand effects may remain (Saiz, 2007).====The data suggest a positive correlation between the stock of immigrants and growth in house prices (Fig. 1). Nevertheless, other factors, such as: employment, incomes, and interest rates, can also impact house prices. Hence, empirical studies typically control for these and other potential covariates.====Our study makes two contributions to this literature. First, the article presents the findings from the first comprehensive meta-regression analysis to evaluate the conflicting claims regarding immigration and house prices. We use meta-regression to integrate the findings from diverse empirical results and to quantify the impact of immigration on house prices: Does immigration affect house prices? Our second contribution is to investigate the impact of deep-seated attitudes. Specifically, we investigate whether the attitude of local populations towards immigrants moderates the impact of immigration. While many individual studies investigate the impact of immigration on house prices, and several studies discuss the issue of amenities and racial preferences (==== Accetturo et al., 2014), this article is the first to directly investigate the potential moderating impact of attitudes. Beliefs and attitudes play a critical role in virtually all market transactions, and attitudes can be central to willingness to pay (Bowles, 1998, Frey, 1999). Consequently, we hypothesize that when locals in destination countries are more accepting of immigrants, the increased demand for housing from immigrants will provide a net boost to house prices. Conversely, when locals are less welcoming of immigrants, we hypothesize that they will be less willing to pay for homes that are near immigrants and consequently house price increases will be modest or may fall.====Studies demonstrate that immigrants self-select into enclaves (e.g. Edin et al., 2003). If immigrants demonstrate preferences to live with like individuals, it may also hold that locals prefer living with other locals. More generally, for locals, immigration may detract from living in an area reducing their willingness to pay for housing, thereby reducing growth in local house prices. This process is not necessarily driven by out-migration. Indeed, there can still be a net population movement ==== a geographic area but people are not prepared to pay as much as other areas because of immigration lowering amenity values. This moderating role of local attitudes to immigrants has not been investigated by any of the primary studies; however, our meta-analysis shows that it matters.====Housing is a universal human right (Nations, 1948, UN General Assembly 1966). Thus, our analysis is especially timely against the backdrop of a worldwide spread of populist and nationalist politics and the rising need to provide adequate housing for dislocated populations and affordable housing for younger generations.",Do house prices ride the wave of immigration?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137718302481,23 April 2019,2019,Research Article,153.0

The primary data set is the National Longitudinal Study of Youth-1979 cohort (NLSY79) and the Child and Young Adult surveys of the children of the female NLSY79 respondents, augmented with a record of the characteristics of dwellings occupied by respondents and their children throughout childhood. We find that living in an owner-occupied home during childhood is positively associated with young adults’ educational attainment, and is negatively associated with teen pregnancy, criminal convictions, and the likelihood of being on welfare. In contrast, a measure of residential crowding during childhood has an independent relationship only with youths’ criminal convictions. We explore several mechanisms that could explain these long run patterns, including unobserved parental heterogeneity and childhood cognition.","This paper analyzes the association between dwelling characteristics and homeownership status experienced during childhood and young adult outcomes. Dwelling characteristics differ systematically by ownership status, with owner-occupied dwellings typically larger and of higher quality than rented dwellings.==== A common finding in the literature is that homeownership during childhood is positively associated with young adult outcomes such as educational attainment, employment, and normative behaviors (abiding by the law, and delaying pregnancy, for example). However, it is not clear whether homeownership per se is beneficial or whether the higher quality dwelling characteristics associated with homeownership account for the positive association between homeownership and young adult outcomes (see Green and White, 1997, Haurin et al., 2002a, Haurin et al., 2002b, Galster et al., 2007, Aaronson, 2000, Barker and Miller, 2009, Bourassa et al., 2016). Due to lack of suitable data, nearly all previous studies on the association between homeownership and young adult outcomes have been unable to control for important dwelling characteristics. For example, in the data we use, the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 cohort, the only information about housing is ownership status, self-reported home value, and interviewer observations about several qualitative features of the living space (e.g. cleanliness, clutter, etc.). We address this problem by adding data to the NLSY79 on respondents’ dwelling characteristics. The housing characteristics include size, number of bedrooms, year built, and type (single family, mobile home, multi-family). The information is derived from public records and was merged to the NLSY79 records by address and year.==== We use these data to estimate the relationship of dwelling characteristics and homeownership with young adult outcomes.====Determining whether and how dwelling characteristics and ownership status are associated with young adult outcomes is important because of the wide variation in housing quality in the United States. According to the American Housing Survey, in 2011 2.13 million households lived in “severely deficient” housing—an indicator of the physical condition of the dwelling (U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, 2013b: 32). The rate of severely deficient dwellings is three times greater for renters than for homeowners. Many households live in overcrowded housing. While the definition of overcrowding is arbitrary, a common standard is more than one person per room or more than two persons per bedroom. In 2005, 2.4% of all households in the U.S. resided in dwellings with more than one person per room (Blake et al., 2007).==== In the NLSY79 sample of respondents with children, 8.1% live in dwellings with more than two persons per bedroom. The percentage of homeowners in the U.S. was 64.4% in 2017, but it was only 39% for unmarried households with children.==== Thus, many children are part of households that live in a low quality dwelling, and many others reside in rental units. If house characteristics and ownership are important inputs in the production of child and young adult outcomes, then these facts are relevant for the determination of housing policy.====This paper separately identifies the associations of house characteristics and homeownership with young adult outcomes. This distinction between dwelling attributes and ownership is useful for determining the appropriate emphasis of housing policy, which has varied widely over the past 60 years (Schwartz, 2010). For example, it is known that the consumption of lead paint has long term deleterious effects on child cognition and behavior. This suggests that housing policy should be targeted toward the attainment of specific quality standards. However, early attempts at improving quality often resulted in public housing projects that were spatially concentrated in high rise buildings located in low income areas. It has been argued that residential crowding has significant adverse effects on children as it may constrain the ability of children to study for school and develop their cognitive skills (Goux and Maurin, 2005).==== This argument suggests that housing policy should be targeted toward establishing standards for dwelling size relative to family size.==== As a third example, the claim that homeownership positively affects young adult outcomes suggests housing policy should be directed towards encouraging ownership, including condominiums as well as single family dwellings.==== Our study tests whether homeownership and selected dwelling characteristic are associated with young adult outcomes, helping to inform the appropriate emphasis of future housing policy.====Our primary source of data is the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1979 cohort (NLSY79), and the associated Child and Young Adult surveys. Child outcomes have been recorded every other year since 1986, and Young Adult outcomes every other year since 1994. We analyze the longer run relationship of childhood housing characteristics with a set of important young adult outcomes. Because the NLSY79 data do not include information on dwelling characteristics, we collected publicly available data describing house characteristics (number of bedrooms, building age, etc.), and merged these data with the main NLSY79 data. Combining these items with NLSY79 respondent reports of ownership status and the very rich data on other inputs and child development makes this a unique data set.====There are two general pathways by which the housing characteristics experienced during childhood may be related to young adult outcomes. One is a direct association between childhood housing experiences and young adult outcomes. Witnessing and participating in the long-term planning, personal responsibility, and daily care required for homeownership and upkeep may teach important life skills. Children who learn these skills may develop a greater sense of personal responsibility, which could manifest as positive young adult outcomes (e.g., more educational investments, delayed pregnancy, etc.). The other is indirect—childhood housing experiences are associated with contemporaneous cognitive and behavioral development, and these factors influence subsequent young adult outcomes.====Our analysis separately identifies these two pathways. We find that childhood housing characteristics have both direct and indirect associations with young adult outcomes, although the direct long run associations clearly dominate. We find that the cumulative amount of time a child resides in an owner-occupied home is positively associated with the child's subsequent educational attainment (high school graduation and college attendance), and is negatively associated with teen pregnancy, criminal convictions, and the likelihood of being on welfare. This pattern is present even after controlling for a large number of other important determinants of young adult outcomes. Residential density, as measured by bedrooms per person experienced during childhood, is not directly associated with any young adult outcome, with one exception: the number of bedrooms per person is, counterintuitively, positively associated with criminal convictions. More recently built dwellings are positively associated with college attendance and negatively associated with ever being on welfare.====Concerning indirect pathways, we find that young adult outcomes are strongly related to childhood measures of cognition (math and reading) and behavioral problems. Thus, if house characteristics are associated with these childhood outcomes, then there is an indirect route by which housing is associated with youth outcomes. However, there is only modest evidence of associations between childhood housing characteristics and contemporaneous measures of child development. There is evidence that homeownership is negatively associated with behavior problems, and living in a newer dwelling is positively associated with reading comprehension and negatively associated with the presence of behavioral problems.====We use a child production function framework as a guide to specification of our empirical models. In this framework, parents and others (child care providers, schools, and peers) provide time and goods inputs that stimulate the development of children's cognitive and non-cognitive skills via the “technology” of the production function. The relationship between inputs and outcomes in this framework is causal: for example, housing characteristics such as the number of bedrooms per child has a direct impact on the development of skills. One approach to estimating the causal effect of housing characteristics on child outcomes is to exploit an exogenous source of variation in the inputs. A leading example is Goux and Maurin (2005), who show that the sex composition of the two youngest children in large French families has a strong impact on the number of bedrooms per child. Families in which the two youngest children are of different sex tend to have more bedrooms for a given family size, due presumably to the reluctance of parents to have mixed-sex bedrooms. This plausibly exogenous source of variation provides a powerful source of identification of the effect of density (bedrooms per child) on educational outcomes. This is a very useful approach, but it has two limitations. First, it is country-specific. Using the same approach with the NLSY79 data, we found that the effect of sex composition on density was much weaker than in France. Second, it does not provide estimates of the effects of other inputs or of the interactions among inputs.====We do not have a source of exogenous variation in dwelling characteristics and homeownership. Housing and other input choices are likely to be correlated with unobserved determinants of child outcomes, e.g. unobserved inputs, parent ability, neighborhood quality, etc. It has proven difficult in the housing literature to find a useful instrument for homeownership status in order to estimate the causal effect of ownership on children. Finding instruments for several additional housing characteristics is even more challenging, and we are unable to find such instruments. We use rich controls for other inputs and productivity factors to deal with the possibility of endogeneity of the inputs. However, there are likely to be additional sources of endogeneity.====An important example in this context is the potential for omitted variable bias resulting from missing neighborhood characteristics that are correlated with homeownership, dwelling characteristics, and young adult outcomes. It is plausible that homeownership and dwelling characteristics are correlated with neighborhood amenities such as school quality, availability of playgrounds and parks, air quality, and intangible aspects of “community spirit,” e.g. neighbors watching out for the safety of each other's children (Haurin et al., 2002a). Omitting such variables from our empirical models is likely to impart an upward bias to our estimates. For example, it is well documented that air quality is higher in higher-socioeconomic-status neighborhoods (e.g., Currie et al., 2014). If homeownership and beneficial dwelling characteristics are also more prevalent in such high-SES neighborhoods, then our estimates of the effects of dwelling characteristics and homeownership would be biased upward due to omission of a measure of air quality. We control for county-level characteristics, but the variation of interest is likely to be at a much finer geographic level within counties. So we do not claim to produce consistent estimates of causal effects. The most plausible interpretation of our estimates is as upper bounds on the true effects of homeownership and dwelling characteristics on young adult outcomes. Nevertheless, the new data we bring to bear provide an unusual opportunity to estimate the associations between homeownership, dwelling characteristics, and young adult outcomes.====In the remainder of the paper, we provide a literature review and specify our contributions in Section 2, a discussion of the empirical approach in Section 3, a description of the data in Section 4, discussion of results in Section 5, and conclusions in Section 6.",Are housing characteristics experienced by children associated with their outcomes as young adults?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137717301304,23 April 2019,2019,Research Article,154.0

As current lease payments are covered by monthly fees that are to be paid to the cooperative, a negative effect on price should mostly be attributed to an increased uncertainty of future levels of monthly fees. We therefore extend the existing literature by examining the impact on price by the remaining leasehold term whilst still controlling for monthly fees. Consistent with our hypothesis, apartment prices are found to increase with 0.22% for each additional year that remains until renegotiation of the lease contract.","Since Hayek's (1945) seminal paper on ====, efficiency through the price system has been a central idea in economics. Nevertheless, the ability of prices to reflect all available information sometimes comes into question. The housing market, where households typically make their single-largest investment, is no exception. Of course, since households tend to finance housing by incurring debt, the decision of buying a home is of great importance to the financial wellbeing of both the individual household and society at large. A potentially large problem occurs if buyers lack information about the rights and obligations associated with buying a home. The aim of this paper is twofold: we want to study the effect on apartment prices by one such piece of information, namely leasehold status, and the uncertainty that is associated with it. In Stockholm, it has been common practice that housing cooperatives are built on leasehold land from the municipality, rather than freehold land, something that historically has lowered the costs through land rent subsidies. This has helped when cooperatives were formed, and in addition, has given the municipality greater influence over land use (Caesar and Kopsch, 2018). It has also been an ideological issue, with leasehold contracts (in contrast to sales of land) being more common during periods of left-wing governance of the municipality.====Up until now, ground lease rents have been set at low levels, with small increases at renegotiations. This system has however begun to come into question, as the municipality of Stockholm has a stated aim of charging market level rents in leasehold agreements. Although problematic to estimate (as there are few or no comparable market rents to observe), this has led to substantial increases of ground lease rents. Although having a somewhat different legal framework, cooperative ownership is present in countries such as the U.S., Canada, Germany, Finland and Sweden. In sum, this form of ownership implies buying a share of a housing cooperative, which in turn gives the owner the right to live in an apartment. Housing cooperatives carry debt and have contractual rights and obligations towards the tenants and third parties. The housing cooperative is also responsible for all structural repairs and maintenance of the property, this includes things such as roofing, landscaping of common areas and trash removal. The housing cooperative finances these expenses through the monthly fees.====Notable is that cooperative ownership is the only type of owner-occupied apartments in Sweden.==== Consequently, one would expect high levels of knowledge about this form of tenure among market participants. Recent media coverage has however highlighted that informational problems do persist, as buyers’ lack knowledge to properly analyze the finances of the housing cooperative. One such example being that recently converted cooperatives (previously being rental apartments) do not set their monthly fees (necessary to cover running costs and future expenditures) at sufficient levels (Donner and Kopsch, 2018). Another example, and the focus of the current paper, concerns the question of housing cooperatives owning or renting their land. This piece of information can affect prices for two reasons. First, any parcel of land may be represented as a bundle of ownership rights. For a leasehold, only a part of these ownership rights may convey to the lessee. This means that the price should, all else equal, be lower for an apartment in cooperative on a leasehold. Second, since ground lease rents are renegotiated over time, there is a portion of uncertainty as to how future rents will be decided. A larger portion of uncertainty will, all else equal, result in a lower price.====The aim of this current paper is to both study the effect of leasehold on apartment price, but in addition add to this, a perhaps more important perspective of uncertainty. Since the political ambition in Stockholm has moved towards more market oriented ground rents, we see a possibility to study the effects of uncertainty on prices, and as a result of that answer a wider question of information and efficiency on housing markets. A short institutional clarification is necessary. Leasehold agreements imply two different types of contract durations. The first concerns the leasehold agreement, and the second concerns specific details of the leasehold agreement, most notably the ground lease rent. A leasehold agreement with the municipality of Stockholm is typically (with few exceptions) valid for a duration of 60 years. After this the municipality has the possibility to terminate the leasehold agreement, if they opt to not doing so, the agreement is prolonged with 40 years. Termination of leasehold agreements for land used for housing is uncommon, to not say non-existent. During these periods of which the leasehold agreement is in place (60 or 40 years) the terms may be renegotiated. Renegotiation typically occurs every ten years (with a few exceptions of older leasehold agreement allowing 20 years between renegotiation). This implies that ground lease rents can be renegotiated every ten years, and with increasing land values during the past decades, this has meant increasing ground lease rents with ten year intervals. A previously unanswered question in relation to leasehold status is: how does contract duration affect prices?====The remainder of this paper is structured as follows; Section 2 provides a literature review, Section 3 describes the data, Section 4 covers the methodology and results.

The methodology is based on a bi-variate model with ==== made up of two equations, one explaining the demolition of the housing of the family and the other explaining the schooling problems of the child. The data used comes from the Demographic Health Survey (DHS) organized in 2011 by the National Institute of Statistics. The results reveal that the demolition of the family housing has a negative impact on the completion of the school year by the child. The probability that the child completes his school year when the family residence has been demolished during the school year decreases by approximately 35.3%. By instrumentalising the variable demolition of the housing, the negative effect of this variable on school completion increases, the marginal effect goes from 35.8% to 67.17%.","The analysis of the impact of the housing conditions of households on child schooling has drawn much attention in recent years. In fact, the capacity of households to protect and take care of children is essential for their development. It is generally agreed that the education of children is an investment of households in human capital (Schultz, 1961, Becker, 1965). For this reason, child education appears among the millennium development objectives. However, in developing countries, the high risk to lose its housing following a demolition can lead to a reduction in the welfare of the household, thus a destruction of human capital (World Bank, 2001). The sudden loss of its housing thus exposes the household to vulnerability, i.e., exposes it to an unforeseen situation from which it cannot protect itself, meaning a lack of means to face this situation without detrimental losses (Chambers, 1989). This unforeseen shock can lead to an important fall in income, wealth, consumption or investment withdrawal with regards to child schooling (Dercon, 2006).====The empirical literature on the effects of the living conditions of households on the schooling of children focuses more on the effects of poverty on child schooling. However, the effect of the demolition of housing which is likely to reinforce the vulnerability of households and increase their investment withdrawal as regards child schooling remains little known in the literature. The existing studies focus first on the effects of the poverty of the household in terms of physical assets on child schooling (Filmer and Pritchett, 1999, Filmer and Pritchett, 20011; Montgomery et al., 2005, Admassie, 2002, Montgomery and Hewett, 2005, Moyi, 2006, Cockburn and Dostie, 2007). For example, a study undertaken in Ethiopia by Admassie (2002), shows that the increase in the assets of the household increases the probability that the children share their time between school and work and this decreases their presence in school and reduces success in school. Cockburn (2007) analyzes the decisions of households concerning the use of children's time and shows that the fact for the households of being owners of cash crop farms decreases school attendance and increases the working time for boys. Filmer and Pritchett (1999) show that in the majority of countries, children from poor households, i.e. owners of a low level of physical assets do not complete primary school. Mayer (2002) reviews many studies on the relationship between poverty and the future of children and finds that the bond between poverty on the future of children is weak. However, the most significant effects are observed on school success and cognitive tests. Other studies that focus on financial aspects show that the poor school performances observed in underprivileged children is explained by the low income of parents (Goux and et Maurin, 2000, Maurin, 2002). The accumulation of the human capital is thus explained by monetary factors, particularly the income of parents. Monetary transfers thus improve the chances of children (Mayer, 2002). Other studies that focus on the effects of non-financial factors on the school performance of children consider the impact of the unemployment of parents (Ermisch et al., 2001, Duée, 2005), the overpopulation of housing (Goux and Maurin, 2003), the size of the household (Merllié and Monso, 2007) and the reading and calculation competences of the parents (Murat, 2009).====Studies that specifically measure the effects of the demolition of the housing of the household on the schooling outcome of children in the developing countries are almost absent. Only few studies mention the effects of shocks witnessed by households on the schooling of children. Among these studies, Jacoby and Skoufias (1997) show that in India, negative shocks on the income of households lead to the withdrawal of children from school. Even if the children resume school later, the interruption leads to lower levels of education, thus reducing the chances of children of building a brighter future. De Janvry et al. (2006) show using Mexican data that shocks on household income can lead to the withdrawal of children from school, to the benefit of work. In the same manner, Alderman et al. (2006) find that children affected by drought in Zimbabwe from 1982 to 1984 durably preserve a lower size and school level. No specific study on the effects of the demolition of the housing of the household on the schooling of children has already been mentioned.====In Cameroon, the insecurity of household as concerns housing is a problem which has gained importance in recent years. According to the results of the last Demographic Health Survey (DHS) carried out in 2011, 65% of households do not have housing security, i.e. they do not have any legal document, even informal (lease, leasing agreement or title deed) for the occupied housing and can consequently be expelled from it (Eds-mics, 2011). Moreover, during the five years preceding the survey, 4% of the population was expelled of its housing. This proportion is higher in urban areas (5%) than in rural areas (2%). The towns of Douala (5%) and Yaounde (7%) and the South-west region (6%) are the areas where these proportions are highest (Eds-mics, 2011). The net school attendance rate for primary education is 79%, which means that more than three-quarters of the population aged 6–11 years (official age of schooling for the primary education level). Two pupils out of ten were repeaters in their class in primary education in 2001, in the 2006/2007 academic year, this rate dropped to one (ECAM, 2007). The factors that explain the school difficulties of children of primary or secondary school age (6–18 years) are, by order of importance, the too high cost of access to school (34,7%), abandonment for reasons of school failure (24,5%), the refusal of the parents to finance the studies (10,4%), the marriage or pregnancy (7,3%) (ECAM, 2007). The question of the insecurity of the housing of the parents seems to be ignored among the reasons explaining the school difficulties of children.====The main objective of this study is to identify the effects of the demolition of the housing of the household on the schooling of children in Cameroon. The contribution of paper lies in the fact that it takes into account the effect of the loss of housing by a household on the capacity of the child to complete his school year. Until now, in spite of the existence of several studies on the relationship between the living conditions of the households and the schooling of children, this effect has been studied little. The significance of this study is justified by at least two reasons. Firstly, education is a Millennium Development Objective. The Cameroonian government seeks to guarantee at least primary education to all the children of school age (DSCE, 2009). The achievement of this objective requires the taking into account of the living conditions of households since education is also an investment of the households. Secondly, for several years now, Cameroonian councils, with the support of the urban councils have undertaken to demolish residences built on risky sites. Though this policy is laudable, its social impact is subject to several controversies. The study of the impact of demolitions of the residences of the households on the education of the children thus comes to contribute to the debate on the social impact of the policies of eviction engaged in Cameroon.====The rest of paper is organized as follows.

During the past 20 years, inflation-adjusted house prices and the stock of mortgage debts have increased rapidly in several countries. Several new financial innovations, such as interest-only mortgages and reduced mortgage repayment rates, were introduced before the outburst of the financial crisis in 2007 (Scanlon et al., 2008, Bank, 2009). Many scholars have emphasized that generous mortgage conditions may have contributed to increased macroeconomic imbalances in several countries, including Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, England, France, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Sweden, and the US. It has been pointed out that mortgage conditions can affect housing markets considerably (André, 2010, Dam et al., 2011, Frisell and Yazdi, 2010, Muellbauer, 2012, Muellbauer et al., 2015, Leigh et al., 2012, Mian and Sufi, 2010, Mian and Sufi, 2012, Duca et al., 2011, Case, 2008). In addition, recent research indicates that periods with high debt levels and/or rapid growth of household debts are often succeeded by falling aggregate demand (Leigh et al., 2012, Bornhorst and Ruiz-Arranz, 2013, Jordà et al., 2013, Mian and Sufi, 2010, Mian and Sufi, 2012, Mian et al., 2013, Cecchetti et al., 2011). Furthermore, after 2007/2008, falling house prices were accompanied by tightening mortgage standards in several countries (see e.g. Scanlon et al., 2011, Duca et al., 2011, Leigh et al., 2012; European Central Bank,==== 2015, p. 58). For example, Canada, Sweden and the Netherlands have recently sharpened regulations regarding mortgage amortization schemes (Schembri, 2014, De Vries and Burrows, 2013, Financial Supervisory Authority 2017). Since then, a small but growing number of studies have been conducted on the effects of mortgage repayment rates on housing markets.====Cocco (2013) employed a panel of about 3 600 households in the UK between 1991 and 2008 and found that households are more likely to take interest-only mortgages the higher their level of education and expected future income, which implies that being able to temporarily abstain from mortgage repayments can facilitate consumption smoothing. Hull (2015) evaluated the upcoming mortgage repayment regulation in Sweden and predicted a small but negative effect on household debts.==== Forlati and Lambertini (2014) employed a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model and concluded that reduced mortgage repayments reduce the welfare of credit-constrained households in the long run because they inflate house prices and force households to reduce their consumption and/or to work longer hours. Johansson et al. (2014) formulated a theoretical short-run model, building on the work by McQuinn and O'Reilly (2007), in which housing expenditures are assumed to be a constant fraction of households’ disposable income. They found that the effects of reduced mortgage repayments on house prices depend on other credit conditions such as the mortgage interest rate level, the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, and whether households choose linear amortizations or annuity mortgages. Damen et al. (2016) developed a model in which house buyers are borrowing-constrained and house prices depend on house buyers’ overall ability to pay (ATP). They discovered a co-integrating relationship between house prices and ATP for eight countries between 1980 and 2008. The results strongly indicated that ATP changes Granger cause house prices for all countries, while the researchers “only” found support for Granger causality from house prices to ATP for three countries. Furthermore, the estimated elasticity of house prices from a change in ATP is close to one that suggests that, for example, increased interest rate deduction will translate into higher house prices with full effect, and will not promote housing affordability in the long run. Dam et al. (2011) employed Danish data to estimate an empirical house price model, assuming that mortgage borrowers made no repayments during the first year after buying, after interest-only mortgage loans were introduced in 2003. They concluded that including first-year payments—with mortgage repayments set to zero—improved their model, and that the introduction of deferred amortization mortgages can explain about 5 percent of the 38 percent increase in real house prices between 1999 and 2010. Recently, Allen et al. (2017) used a microsimulation model of mortgage demand in Canada. The Canadian government loosened the mortgage insurance qualifying rules between 2006 and 2007 by increasing the maximum allowable amortization period from 40 to 25 years and by increasing the maximum allowable LTV from 95 to 100 percent. In order to secure the long-term stability of the mortgage market mortgage lending rules where tightened 2008–2012 (Schembri, 2014). A key finding in Allen et al. (2017) is that households are more constrained by wealth constraints than monthly cash flows. However, Allen et al. (2017) also found that the average house buyer does not use lower amortization requirements to reduce their monthly mortgage expenses. Moreover, their microsimulation findings suggest that lower/tighter amortization requirements increased/decreased mortgage demand among first time house buyers. Madsen (2012) employed a panel of 18 OECD countries for the period from 1973 to 2008 and developed a model in which house prices are affected by nominal mortgage payments. He found that including nominal mortgage payment improved the econometric fit, while the conventional user cost variable turned out to be insignificant and/or having the “wrong” (i.e. positive) sign. However, even though Madsen (2012) merged repayment rates with other nominal housing payments in his theoretical model, he was unable to include repayment rates when testing the model empirically, presumably due to lack of data. Similarly, Damen et al. (2016) “construct weights for the different mortgage types based on country reports or academic articles and interpolate for unknown periods.”==== This is in line with our observations that the ability to empirically assess how housing markets are affected by changing mortgage repayment rates is limited by a lack of data at the aggregated level. In fact, we are not aware of any study that has employed actual repayment rates and empirically estimated their effects on housing markets at the aggregated level in recent years. Moreover, until now, most studies have been concerned with the effects on house prices, and do not examine the effects on sales, which are typically more volatile and responsive to changes in housing demand than are prices (see Fig. 1, Fig. 2 in Section 2). Studies on the effects of repayment rates on household debts are also rare. Thus, our understanding of how changes in cash flows for existing as well as potential home owners affect housing markets and the economy, even when real user costs are constant, is incomplete.====The objective of this paper is to analyze how the introduction of interest-only mortgages in 2003 affected the Danish housing market. We employ data from 2001 to 2013 and estimate ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions to analyze how nominal mortgage payments (including actual mortgage repayments to mortgage credit institutes, (MCIs), which grant the majority of all mortgages) relate to a set of three dependent variables: Eq. (1) real house prices, Eq. (2) the number of property sales, and Eq. (3) household mortgage debts in relation to disposable incomes. We proceed as follows: First, we compare statistical information criteria to investigate whether including mortgage repayments in nominal housing payments improves the econometric fit of our OLS regressions. Second, we test whether repayments are statistically different from the remaining nominal housing payments. Third, we follow Madsen (2012) and include a measure of real user costs alongside nominal mortgage payments as explanatory variables, in order to investigate which variable is more important in explaining the movements of the dependent variables. Our study is also related to Damen et al. (2016) who found a stronger relationship between house buyers’ overall ability to pay and house prices than between real user costs and house prices for seven out of eight countries. Our analysis can contribute to an increased understanding regarding whether (1) agents make decisions about housing consumption based on real (user) costs or on nominal mortgage payments/costs; and (2) whether mortgage repayments (which are a kind of expenditure but not a cost) belong to the set of housing expenditures that affect the behavior of housing consumers.====We model the long run and estimate the relationships between the dependent and explanatory variables in level form and then estimate the short-run determinants by employing error-correction models. The second step might provide insights into the reaction speeds of the dependent variables with respect to changes in housing payments. We use our regression results to simulate the effects of the introduction of mortgage-only loans in 2003 and the dynamic impact of a permanent one-time shock of nominal housing payments. Furthermore, we complement our conventional regressions and perform event studies because we cannot guarantee causal effects of changes in repayment rates on the dependent variables. The purpose of our event study is to investigate whether our dependent variables developed in a non-normal fashion in connection to the introduction of interest-only-mortgages.====The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Sections 2 and 3 describe recent housing market developments in Denmark and explain why we should pay attention to mortgage repayments.

We use a database with precise information on home characteristics at a property level to show that this is not always correct. We also exploit a refinery closure to address locational sorting and all other unobserved attributes. Refinery closure is associated with an approximately 1.5 µg per cubic metre decrease in SO==== air pollution, and refinery closure leads to a 6.7% increase in property values with at least 5 rooms or a benefit of approximately 457 million for these households; however, it leads to 28% declines in property values in Dunkirk with one room or a loss of approximately 1 billion for these households.","Assessing the correct impact of environment quality on consumer welfare is crucial for policymakers. To do so, we know from Rosen (1974)’s hedonic model that willingness to pay for a change in natural resources can be inferred on a general differentiated product market. Moreover, Palmquist (1992) demonstrates that hedonic techniques are particularly well adapted to studying localized externalities since the key problems with the hedonic methodology and benefit estimation do not arise. Hence, a large part of the recent economic literature makes use of localized externalities in their analysis because it only affects people in proximity to the externality. Although there may be heterogeneity in preferences in localized externalities, most of the hedonic literature treats the housing market as a single entity. However, the association of a single type of environmental preferences to a geographic area (a tract) may lead to non-reliable measures for regulatory policies. In fact, different type of preferences may be gathered within one single tract and would justify a sub-tract level analysis.====Hence, this article aims to analyse to what extent hedonic prices analysis captures people’s willingness to pay for perceived differences in environmental attributes when there may be considerable heterogeneity in preferences in localized changes at a sub-tract level. More specifically, this study on air pollution and house prices analyses the impact of the closure of a toxic site, leading to a change in atmospheric pollution, on the prices of homes near the site. We believe that this study is the first high-resolution empirical analysis to shed light on the heterogeneity in environmental preferences using housing price characteristics.====While some studies consider heterogeneity in preferences at the tract level (Bayer et al., 2007), very few studies try to analyse heterogeneity in preferences within a tract. Heterogeneity in preferences within a tract has been highlighted in the empirical literature using tract-level median housing values (Gamper-Rabindran, Timmins, 2013, Currie, Davis, Greenstone, Walker, 2015) or buyers’ household profiles (Kestens et al., 2006). Kestens et al. (2006) look at the influence of buyers’ household profiles on house prices, although this is a source of endogeneity.==== Gamper-Rabindran and Timmins (2013) find that there is considerable heterogeneity in the capitalization of clean-ups of hazardous waste across the USA based on the entire housing value distribution. Currie et al. (2015) compare estimates from the housing value analysis with a valuation of health impacts at the tract level and find no effects on areas with low birth weights having above-median housing values. Gamper-Rabindran and Timmins (2013) argue only few studies take into account heterogeneity in preferences in localized changes mainly due to data inaccessibility and the lack of fine-resolution data. As recognized by Currie et al. (2015), the main limitation of their dataset is that it contains very limited information related to housing unit characteristics. Using data with very high resolution (at the transaction scale), we go further with this refinement by considering not only the entire housing value distribution but also home characteristics, i.e., the distribution of the number of rooms and the distinction between flats and houses. Further, the estimates are based on tens of thousand of housing transactions. We do so using a difference-in-difference (DiD) strategy.====Empirically, some controversial issues may arise when trying to credibly estimate WTP for an environmental change. With heterogeneity in preferences and sorting, it also becomes unclear whose WTP is being estimated (Bayer et al., 2007). An issue frequently associated with the hedonic price model is pollution endogeneity. Hedonic pricing analysis (HPA) considers that pollution is an exogenous variable in the regression of house prices, which is not always correct (Palmquist and Israngkura, 1999). Confounding factors, such as the opening of new businesses, may evolve over time in conjunction with worsening air pollution. In addition, people with high preferences for air quality may sort themselves into locations with good air quality. In this context, the value of the average marginal price of air pollution could be incorrectly estimated.====To mitigate these problems, the main strategy of the recent empirical literature is to use an exogenous source of variation in environmental quality to observe how the quality change was capitalized into housing prices (Chay and Greenstone, 2005), (Currie et al., 2015), (Greenstone and Gallagher, 2008). These capitalization effects are then interpreted as welfare measures (Kuminoff and Pope, 2014). Hence, this study combines the analysis of the heterogeneity in preferences within a tract with a difference-in-difference (DiD) model in an hedonic framework. The literature underscores the need to improve current and to develop novel methods to improve our ability to estimate the marginal WTP for environmental improvements with market data (Bento, 2013, Guignet, Jenkins, Ranson, Walsh, 2018) and the need to better understanding belief formation around local amenities (Currie, Davis, Greenstone, Walker, 2015, Glennon, Kiefer, Mayock, 2018).====As a tool, the analysis makes use of a French municipality in the Nord-Pas de Calais region, Dunkirk, where a refinery was recently closed. Pollution levels and house prices are compared before and after the closure, both within Dunkirk, namely, the treated group, and in municipalities located within a 50 km radius of Dunkirk, namely, the control group.====All of the people living near a refinery may not be affected by its closure in the same way. Numerous environmental and economical issues exist following the refinery closure that could affect population perception differently. Then, using a combination of two shocks, we are also able to recover heterogeneity in environmental preferences at the sub-tract level.====In fact, in the case of the closure in Dunkirk, there have been both economic and environmental shocks. The environmental shock corresponds to a decrease in the concentration of pollution in the Dunkirk area following the closure. Thus, I assume that the closure of the refinery may have reduced the health risks from air pollution==== and is likely to have increased the aesthetic value of the site’s vicinity. The closure may have enhanced the value of neighbourhood properties. In parallel, the refinery closure produced an economic shock in terms of employment and economic activity around Dunkirk. People living near the refinery with a high or low income may thus be affected differently by the refinery’s closure and choose to locate in different areas. As the population became unemployed, the economy of the area stagnated. The slowdown in activity decreased the wealth of people living in the vicinity of the refinery. Economic activity can also have a direct impact on prices and may bias the estimates of the economic benefits of an environmental improvement. Nevertheless, this economic shock appears to have affected the entire Nord-Pas de Calais region in terms of economic outcomes due to the direct and indirect employment consequences of the refinery’s closure. While the economic shock has affected the entire sample, the environmental shock affects a specific geographical zone, which enables us to make the distinction between both shocks.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section II describes the situation following the refinery closure, while Section III presents the dataset. Section IV introduces the empirical model and notation. Section V shows that the closure of the refinery led to a reduction in air pollution. Bearing in mind the positive effect of the closure on the aesthetic value of the site’s vicinity and on health (Lavaine, 2016), Section VI shows, in parallel, that the effects of the refinery closure on property prices are not always what one might expect. This paper assumes, in a context of localized changes, with potential heterogeneity in preferences, data regarding the capitalization effects at the tract level may fail to provide credible measures of consumer welfare.

We find that whites bear less noise than either blacks or Hispanics and that blacks tend to experience more traffic noise than Hispanics. While every Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) showed that blacks experienced relatively more noise than average, such a result did not hold for Hispanics in roughly half of the MSAs. We find much heterogeneity across Census tracts using LWR. For most Census tracts, higher black and Hispanic population shares are associated with increased noise. However, 5.5% of the coefficients for blacks and 18.9% for Hispanics are negative, suggesting larger population shares are associated with less noise. The noise LWR marginal effects for black populations across most tracts in the state are consistent with diminishing marginal noise from additional black population, while those in Atlanta exhibit diminishing marginal noise for Hispanics. In many regions of the state where the potential for health-damaging noise exists, we find relatively high disproportionality in noise experienced by the black and Hispanic populations compared to the rest of the overall population. Our findings underscore the importance of using nonparametric estimation approaches to unveil spatial heterogeneity in applied urban and housing economics analyses.","Much is unknown about the ultimate effects of traffic noise on nearby residents and whether certain demographic groups may bear the burden of the noise more disproportionately than other groups. In this paper we focus on this latter issue. Specifically, we examine both general road noise and aircraft-related noise for MSAs located in Georgia.==== Using traffic noise measures in conjunction with various data at the Census tract-level, we consider noise levels across MSAs in Georgia and generate figures and statistical estimates to summarize the relationship between noise and the burdens borne by demographic groups. We also describe various relationships, including how some vary over space, more closely via regression analysis.====Over the last two decades a substantial research effort has been undertaken to identify the effects of noise on health.==== A consistent finding is that the health of individuals exposed to excessive noise tends to be affected adversely. Children are especially at risk for negative effects.====These potential health effects have generated increased attention in recent years. While a statistical analysis of environmental justice is clearly beyond our scope, some of the increased attention in this literature has occurred because environmental justice issues have become more prominent.==== Three airport-noise studies are related directly to the current study – Ogneva-Himmelberger and Cooperman, 2010, Sobotta et al., 2007, and Cohen and Coughlin (2012). Ogneva-Himmelberger and Cooperman (2010), using Boston's Logan International Airport, find that minority and lower-income populations are subjected to relatively higher noise levels than their counterparts. Sobotta et al. (2007) regress airport noise in Phoenix, expressed as a qualitative dependent variable, on various independent variables, including the percentage of neighborhood population that is Hispanic. They find that households in neighborhoods with a greater Hispanic population were subjected to higher noise levels than households in other neighborhoods. Following McMillen and McDonald (2004), Cohen and Coughlin (2012) estimate ordered probit locally weighted regressions (OPLWR) to explore the issue of spatial heterogeneity in the context of the determinants of airport noise in Atlanta.====Cohen and Coughlin (2012) find notable differences in parameter estimates for different houses in their sample with the OPLWR estimates. In particular, the sign on the coefficient for each explanatory variable contains some positive and some negative values. Also, compared to an ordered probit model, the mean of the magnitudes of the coefficients for some of the other explanatory variables is larger with the OPLWR model, while for other coefficients the mean is smaller. These differences between the OPLWR and ordered probit results imply that focusing exclusively on an ordered probit model for the determinants of noise can lead to biased estimates in our context due to ignored heterogeneity among individual houses in our sample. Overall, the heterogeneity over the relatively small area examined precluded any environmental-justice generalizations with respect to either the black or Hispanic populations.====Focusing on transportation noise in general, few studies have examined differences in exposure across demographic groups. Among these studies, more evidence has been produced on the association of noise and income differences than on the association of noise and ethnic differences.====Brainard et al. (2004) explored exposure to noise in Birmingham, UK. The connection between noise and various socioeconomic indicators was examined. No relationship was found between noise exposure and age. At most, only weak evidence was found for a relationship between noise exposure and ethnicity. Indian and Pakistani sub-groups tended to have lower exposure than the city average, while blacks tended to have higher exposure. Finally, evidence of a weak relationship between noise exposure and economic deprivation was found. Because of the strong association between ethnicity and deprivation, the authors could not identify the independent effects of these variables.====As part of a study examining various environmental indicators in the greater Rotterdam region known as the Rijnmond, Kruize et al. (2007a) examined exposure to traffic noise. They found increased noise exposure for those with lower incomes, but these differences across income categories were quite small. Somewhat surprisingly, they found higher air traffic noise exposure to be associated with higher incomes.====In a related study, Kruize et al. (2007b) examined equity in an area surrounding the Amsterdam Airport (Schiphol). Similar to Kruize et al. (2007a), various environmental indicators were used, but we restrict our focus to noise. Also, because of a lack of data on race, income was the key socioeconomic indicator. In addition to the distribution of environmental quality, the authors explored the interaction of market forces and government policy that produced equity. A key finding was that exposure to higher levels of traffic noise was similarly distributed across income categories; however, those with lower incomes tended to be exposed to relatively more traffic noise. This finding resulted from changes in the relative power of government regulation and market forces.====Finally, Havard et al. (2011) found that in Paris higher levels of noise in a neighborhood were associated with higher educational attainment and higher property values. In addition, more noise was associated with higher proportions on non-French citizens; however, when citizens were connected to their origin countries, they found that more noise was associated with higher proportions of citizens from advantaged countries.====A standard issue in this literature can be phrased as follows: Were a disproportionate percentage of minority residents already present at the time the environmental hazard was sited or did the disproportionate percentage occur as a result of location decisions after the hazard was sited? This question cannot be adequately answered in most cases without panel data.====In the case of traffic noise throughout the state of Georgia, this issue is not of major concern. The vast majority of the locations of roads were determined many years ago. Of course, this issue is of importance for the construction of new roads and airport expansions/modifications.====Turning to our paper, we begin by providing some basic statistics at the Census tract-level for the housing market in Georgia. Next, we construct curves that are similar, but not identical, to Lorenz curves to generate a number of facts about traffic noise and the exposure of whites, blacks, and Hispanics to it. We follow with statistical analyses to examine a number of simple relationships between traffic noise and economic/demographic variables. Our additional analysis provides insights on the relationships between road noise and economic/demographic variables.",Traffic noise in Georgia: Sound levels and inequality,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137718300366,22 March 2019,2019,Research Article,159.0

We find that, contrary to expectations, zoning is strongly negatively associated with park rents in periurban and rural parks, but appears as a positive driver in high-growth cities. We then extend this model to an out-of-sample prediction for MHPs rents in Texas.","It is estimated that roughly 10.5 million - over 3% - of Americans live in manufactured housing parks (Becker and Yea, 2015). For North Carolina and many other states with a dispersed population and mild climate, the proportion is higher still: a plausible guess is that about 8% of the states more than 10 million residents live in parks. Surprisingly little is known about this important component of the housing market, even though it is a key element of affordable housing.====The distinctive feature of MHPs - more commonly referred to as “trailer parks” - is that ownership is typically divided. Most residents own the structure in which they live (or occupy it on a rent-to-own basis) and rent the land, pad, and infrastructure provided by the park owner. This arrangement has many advantages, including shared risk and improved upkeep incentives, as well as policing of neighbors, since those in violation of park rules can be evicted. However, threat of eviction also creates an essentially uninsurable risk for the homeowner, since moving manufactured homes is costly and often infeasible, leading to fire sales or abandonment.====This unusual institutional arrangement invites questions as to how park rents are determined - do they reflect implicit long-term contracts that vary little if at all with fluctuations in general housing markets nearby? Do restrictions on park entry and expansion caused by NIMBY (not-in-my-backyard) sentiments create local monopolies for incumbents and drive prices up? What park features are most important?====Careful analysis of park rents is scarce (see Section 2 and Appendix A for literature reviews). Median values across regions are available, but linking them in any sort of causal sense to underlying economic conditions and park characteristics does not appear in the literature. This absence does not reflect lack of interest: on the contrary, one motivation in writing this paper is to respond to inquiries from park owners.====In the pages that follow, we present detailed information on patterns of MHP lot rents across North Carolina. The picture itself is novel, but we go further in seeking to describe the market and take first steps at establishing causal links within sub-markets. However, an important caveat is in order: the findings below are only first steps, and truly establishing causality would require information on repeat events. These data do not exist in sufficient number. The values we use are taken from Datacomp’s database of manufactured home resales; the information provided includes reported park rents paid. However, repeated sales are fairly infrequent, making it impractical to control for unit or park fixed effects that are otherwise unobservable, and which may be correlated with included variables.====This caveat notwithstanding, the data are highly informative, and yield several findings of interest to policymakers and those in the industry, as well as to academics interested in the US housing market. First, the stereotype of an industry run by a mix of either extortionists or patrician small park owners seems inaccurate. Park rents move with economic conditions in a way that is not observably consistent with either of these characterizations. Second, the MHP market is spatially segmented, and empirical work that treats it as unified will give misleading results. In particular, local zoning measures appear to be the strongest predictor of suburban and rural park rents, while block group apartment rents most strongly predict rents in urban areas.====This paper is written largely in response to two questions posed by mobile home park investor Frank Rolfe: ==== And, with North Carolina specifically in mind: ====This second question helps explain our focus on North Carolina. Manufactured housing parks and characteristics of park owners in the United States vary immensely. While there is disagreement as to which firm is the largest site owner, it appears that Sam Zell’s Equity Lifestyle Communities and Sun Communities have between 70,000 and 140,000 sites each, typically in parks with several hundred units, with RHP Properties and Yes! Communities close at their heels.==== In contrast, many small “mom n’ pop” operators own only a single park; often these have fewer than 25 units, and in North Carolina one commonly encounters tiny parks with fewer than a dozen units. Manufactured Housing Institute (MHI) information on the headquarters of the largest 50 park owners indicates that none is in North Carolina, or indeed elsewhere in the south outside of Florida, save for one in Kentucky.====In short, although the prevalence of manufactured housing is greatest in the Southeastern United States, there can be no doubt that major “corporate” park owners do not favor the region, save for retirement communities along the Gulf Coast. The obvious reason is that suggested by Rolfe: the region is not land scarce, nor is it strictly zoned, so that rising demand for moderate-income housing is likely to be met by construction of new units (including apartment buildings, site-built homes, and MHP expansion) rather than generating rising rents and hence profits for park owners.====A focus on North Carolina allows us to explore the validity of this claim. For reasons detailed below, it appears that this stereotype is dated. Although the American South is land-abundant and less regulated than elsewhere, the highly concentrated nature of its economic growth has resulted in rising park rents in prospering regions, which also discourage park construction or expansion, and, indeed, low-income housing more generally. Economic growth in the state’s leading metro areas also leads to a high and likely rising risk of park closure in the coming decade - though even in smaller towns and rural areas, park closure remains a risk====The remainder of our paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 is a brief literature review, Section 3 describes our data construction, Section 4 provides descriptive statistics, Section 5 outlines our empirical specification, Sections 6 and 7 report results for both OLS and 2SLS models, Section 8 discusses external relevance, and Section 9 concludes.",Zoned out?

A comparison of mean values for a host of household and neighborhood variables often shows wide, and usually predictable, differences in values between neighborhoods designated as slums by the Census and nonslum neighborhoods that lack this designation. The paper presents a variety of descriptive regressions making use of these rich data, while providing evidence consistent with the squeezing hypothesis in city-level regressions showing that a higher population share or land share in slums leads to higher formal rents.","Slums represent a major social challenge for poor and emerging economies. It is estimated that, in the developing regions, 872 million people lived in slums in 2010, with Brazil accounting for 11 million of this total slum population (see UN-Habitat (2016)). Slums are pockets of poverty inside urban areas, mostly deprived of public services and associated with informal land tenure. Informality often involves squatting, where households illegally occupy a parcel of land while paying no compensation to its owner.==== Since the legal owner of the land has eviction rights, informality is often accompanied by tenure insecurity. Slums and insecurity are, in turn, closely linked because the eviction threat may retard investment in housing improvements by the slum household. This missing incentive to invest helps (along with poverty) to explain the minimal nature of much slum housing, which often consists of shacks constructed out of abandoned materials. For a graphic description of slum conditions in developing countries, see Marx, Stoker and Suri (2013).====During the second half of the 20th century, Brazil experienced significant migration flows of poor rural emigrants to the largest metropolitan areas. These migrants settled either on the periphery or in empty areas within cities, often on steep terrain with landslide risk or in flood-prone areas near rivers. Slums thus emerged mostly without state oversight, not following urban planning guidelines and deprived of public services such as sanitation or policing. Slum proliferation became one of the endemic socioeconomic problems in Brazil, helping to engender extreme levels of inequality accompanied by violence.==== Despite the seriousness of the slum problem, most research on the topic is based on case studies and anecdotal evidence.====The purpose of this paper is to provide a body of descriptive evidence on Brazilian slums (known as ====), relying on the wealth of information available in the Demographic Census of the Brazilian Bureau of Statistics (IBGE). We rely on data at the level of enumeration district, each of which contains around 250–350 households who respond to a detailed survey asking for information about the household (race and sewer connection, for example), which is supplemented by block-level information on neighborhood characteristics associated with slums (street garbage and sewage, for example), which is tabulated by Census enumerators. Aggregation to the enumeration-district level yields average values across households or blocks.====Census workers also assign a slum designation to enumeration districts that meet a number of criteria, including lack of public services, absence of land titling, and terrain steepness, and this designation plays a central role in the analysis. To capture the common hillside locations of slums, the Census data are supplemented by satellite information on the average steepness of the terrain slope within the enumeration district.==== Other sources yield additional data on the district’s distance to the CBD and proximity to a riverbank, a non-river body of water, or a railway. The resulting data set contains 7 household characteristics, 13 neighborhood characteristics associated with slums, 5 locational characteristics, and the slum dummy.====We start by discussing the data in Section 2, providing a revealing comparison of the variables’ mean values between slum and nonslum enumeration districts. In Section 3, we start by asking which physical features of an enumeration district (lack of electricity or sewer connections, for example) lead to slum designation by the Census enumerators, running a logit regression that makes use of the detailed neighborhood, terrain, and locational characteristics. This exercise is carried out in Section 3.1 of the paper. In Section 3.2, we ask how each of the 13 slum-related neighborhood characteristics individually varies with location, regressing each characteristic (lack of electricity, for example) on the slope, riverbank, water, and railway dummies and on distance to the CBD. In Section 4, we ask how income and population density vary with distance to the metropolitan area’s CBD and how they differ between slum and non-slum districts. In addition to documenting slum effects, these regressions show for the first time that income in Brazilian cities declines with distance to the CBD, reversing the US pattern. Our next question concerns who lives in slums, and it is answered in Section 5 by individually regressing the slum dummy and each of the 13 neighborhood-characteristics variables on the set of 7 household characteristics. The regressions show, for example, how a lack of electricity is related to the district’s average household income. These regressions are similar to ones presented by Brueckner (2013b) in a study of slum housing in Indonesia. Together, the regressions just described provide a wealth of descriptive evidence on Brazilian slums.====The last step in the empirical analysis is designed to test a hypothesis suggested by theoretical analysis of urban squatting presented by Brueckner and Selod (2009) and Brueckner (2013a).==== The models in these papers view squatter or informal housing as “squeezing” the formal housing market by reducing the amount of a city’s land area available to formal residents, thus raising the price of land in the formal area. This price increase, by raising the rental income lost to squatting, increases the incentive of landowners to evict the squatters, an outcome that the model’s squatter organizer avoids by limiting expansion of his informal community. The squeezing hypothesis is tested by regressing, at level of individual cities, a measure of average rent in the formal sector on the average characteristics of formal dwellings and on the size of the city’s slum sector, measured either by land area or population. This exercise is carried out in Section 6, and the paper’s conclusions are presented in Section 7.====While providing a rare picture of slums in an important country, the paper adds to a long literature on housing in the developing world. Some of these studies estimate standard hedonic price functions using LDC data (Follain, Lim, Renaud, 1980, Follain, Lim, Renaud, 1982, Follain and Jimenez (1985)), while others constrast estimated hedonic functions for informal and formal areas to measure the price discount associated with tenure insecurity (Jimenez (1984), Friedman et al. (1988), Kapoor and le Blanc (2008)). Other studies investigate how land titling in informal areas increases the incentive for housing investment (Field, 2005, Galiani, Schargrodsky, 2010), while some papers appraise the effect of land-use regulation in LDCs (Hannah et al. (1993), Malpezzi and Mayo (1997), Bertaud and Malpezzi (2001), Monkkonnen (2013)). Other studies analyze the effects of slum-improvement programs with the goal of guiding the design of such programs (Takeuchi, Cropper, Bento, 2008, Lall, Lundberg, Shalizi, 2008). In studies focusing on Brazilian cities, Hidalgo et al. (2010) explore the determinants of “land invasions,” where newly arrived squatters occupy urban land, and Feler and Henderson (2011) study under-servicing of slum areas as a way some Brazilian cities attempt to reduce rural-urban migration. See Smolka and Biderman (2011) and Brueckner and Lall (2017) for surveys of this literature.====Before proceeding to the analysis, a few comments on slum-related policies in Brazil are in order. Slums have obviously escaped the strict land-use regulations that tend to raise the cost of formal housing, thus giving residents access to affordable shelter. In early years, one response to slum growth by the authorities was to remove and relocate the inhabitants into public housing developments. More recently, though, policy has gravitated toward the opposite view, with slum dwellers given the right to remain where they live, following a human rights perspective that stems from the 1988 constitution. As the official viewpoint evolved, tenure security in slums has become strong enough to promote the gradual private improvement of individual housing structures. Urban infrastructure, in turn, has been built in response to the slum community’s capacity for mobilization and political negotiation. The paradox is that slums remain mostly outside of the government’s reach, not conforming to urban land-use regulations, lacking land titles, and not paying land taxes despite the benefits of some urban services due to slum upgrading projects.","Slums in Brazil: Where are they located, who lives in them, and do they ‘squeeze’ the formal housing market?",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137718302171,5 March 2019,2019,Research Article,161.0

We use detailed New Zealand housing market data to evaluate the effect of loan-to-value ratio (LTV) restrictions on ,"Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) and Claessens et al. (2012) find that recessions are more severe when they are accompanied by financial crises. The comovement between financial crises and recessions is problematic for policy-makers – the experience of the global financial crisis highlighted that prototypical monetary policy focused on price stability does not ensure financial stability. To foster financial stability, policy-makers developed a new set of policies – known as macroprudential policies – to complement monetary policy.====Broadly speaking, macroprudential policy has two main objectives: i) enhancing the resilience of the financial system by increasing buffers within financial institutions; and ii) limiting the build-up of financial imbalances by moderating asset price and credit cycles. In this paper, we focus on the second objective of macroprudential policy and evaluate the effectiveness of loan-to-value ratio (LTV) restrictions in moderating house price inflation in New Zealand.====As shown in Fig. 1, in response to financial stability risks associated with rapidly rising house prices, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) implemented three rounds of restrictions on high-LTV lending between 2013 and 2016. The first round of LTV policy was imposed nationwide in October 2013, with the goal of helping to “slow the rate of housing-related credit growth and house price inflation, thereby reducing the risk of a substantial downward correction in house prices that would damage the financial sector and the broader economy” (Wheeler, 2013). This policy appeared to have a notable effect on house price inflation in both Auckland and the rest of New Zealand for around six months. Subsequent rounds of LTV policy changes were implemented in November 2015 and October 2016. These policies were designed with a similar objective in mind, but varied across purchaser classes and regions to target areas and groups viewed as being of particular risk to financial stability.====This paper contributes to the international policy debate on the effectiveness of macroprudential policy. We quantify the effect of LTV policy as implemented in New Zealand between 2013 and 2016, in moderating house prices.==== The main challenge in identifying these effects is that housing markets are affected by a range of factors over and above LTV policy. New Zealand experienced a raft of policy changes and macroeconomic shocks during the periods in which LTV policy changes were implemented. Many of these shocks and policies are likely to have affected the housing market. For example, when the first LTV policy was implemented, retail interest rates were rising alongside an increasing expectation for monetary policy tightening, while the New Zealand Treasury was adjusting housing-related policies at the time of the second LTV policy.====Given the potential effects of these other policies and events on the housing market, it is challenging to disentangle the effect of LTV policy. To cope with this identification problem, in this paper we use a detailed micro-dataset of housing market transactions in New Zealand and apply a difference-in-difference (DiD) methodology to identify the effects of the LTV policies on house prices. In particular, purchases of newly-built dwellings were exempt from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's LTV policies (but not from other macroeconomic shocks or policy changes). This allows us to use ‘new builds’ as the control group relative to existing homes, with the latter representing the ‘treatment’ group affected by changes in the LTV policies.==== Applying this approach to identify the effect of LTV policy, we find that, over the one-year-window around the new home exemption, the first LTV policy (referred to as ‘LTV 1′) is estimated to have had a 2.4 percent moderating effect on house prices, and this moderating effect is stronger in the rest of New Zealand than in the Auckland housing market. In addition, our estimates reveal that the second round of the LTV policy change (which tightened restrictions on Auckland properties and loosened restrictions elsewhere) did not significantly stop Auckland house prices from rising. By contrast, house prices in the rest of New Zealand (RONZ) increased by 3 percent due to the relative loosening of the LTV restriction. In the third round of LTV policy, the RBNZ further tightened the LTV restrictions on property investors nationwide. The moderating effect of LTV 3 was seen both in Auckland and RONZ. The estimated effect of LTV policy is both statistically and economically significant. The estimates for different post-event windows suggest that the effect of LTV policy is short-lived, with a peak at the sixth month, and vanishes after 12 months. Our empirical results suggest that, in New Zealand, the LTV policy works primarily through limiting the demand that had been fuelled by the credit from equity extraction. We find that differences in the magnitude and duration of the LTV effects across regions and across time are related to underlying house price inflation around the period of LTV implementation. This is because an inflated housing value can reduce the loan-to-value ratio and relax the LTV restriction on borrowers. If the macroprudential authority wants to achieve a lasting effect, it is necessary to continue tightening LTV restrictions or look at alternative policy tools, such as debt-to-income ratio restrictions.====This paper is related to the rapidly expanding literature on the effectiveness of macroprudential policy. Wong et al. (2011) present cross-country evidence from Korea, Hong Kong SAR, Singapore, and Malaysia that shows that low LTVs can reduce delinquencies in response to economic downturns and property price busts. Lim et al. (2011) also consider several different measures of macroprudential policy, using data covering 49 countries from 2000 to 2010. They find that in more than half of the countries in their sample, credit growth and house price inflation decline after the implementation of an LTV rule. Kuttner and Shim (2016) use a panel of 57 countries to evaluate the effectiveness of a wide range of macroprudential, housing, and tax policies on imbalances in the housing market. They find that maximum debt-service-to-income ratios and increases in housing-related taxes have significant negative effects on housing credit and house price growth. Tightening LTV restrictions has a statistically significant effect on house prices, but loosening LTV restrictions does not have a statistically significant impact. In our study, we find evidence of strong effects for both LTV tightening and loosening, depending on whether the loan-to-value ratio is binding or not in the economy.====Cerutti et al. (2017) use a more recent survey on the use of macroprudential policies in 119 countries. Their analysis covers 12 different measures, some of which are targeted towards households, namely debt-to-income (DTI) and LTV rules. When looking at advanced and emerging countries separately, the authors find that in the advanced countries there is a weak negative association between some of the borrower-based measures and household credit growth, but no association between the measures and house prices.==== In general, cross-country studies mostly show that the implementation of credit restrictions on mortgage loans is associated with slower credit and house price growth. While this approach permits broad conclusions to be drawn regarding macroprudential policy, it is difficult to interpret the results without further details on the measures implemented and housing market conditions. In contrast, our study provides a precise identification strategy that exploits country-specific policy details that cannot be taken into consideration in large cross-country studies. In particular, we use specific features of the policy changes that allow us to use a DiD methodology to more precisely estimate their impact====In this sense, this paper is also related to recent literature using micro data and the difference-in-difference approach to evaluate the effectiveness of macroprudential policies. Jiménez et al. (2015) study the effects of the dynamic provisioning scheme implemented in Spain on credit growth using credit register data. Aregger et al. (2013) examine the impact of transaction taxes and capital gains taxes on house price growth in Switzerland. Barroso et al. (2017) estimate the impact of reserve requirements on credit supply and Godoy de Araujo et al. (2017) study the effect of LTV restrictions on credit supply. Both studies use a large loan-level dataset from Brazil. Similarly, Aguirre and Repetto (2017) assess the impact of capital- and currency-based macroprudential policy measures on credit growth at the bank-firm level, using credit registry data from Argentina.====The most closely related study to ours is Igan and Kang (2011), who investigate the effects of changing DTI and LTV limits on housing market activities and house prices in Korea. Similarly to our study, they use micro data to address the endogeneity issue. In particular, they use household-level data to compare control and treatment groups with similar characteristics and interpret the average difference as the effect of macroprudential policy. The drawback of their identification strategy is that households subject to LTV treatment can be systematically different from those that are not. In other words, it is very difficult to ensure the two groups are exactly the same except for the policy treatment. In contrast, our identification relies on properties that are subject to different LTV treatment. In this respect, it is easier to control for different characteristics across houses than across households, where the latter might differ in many unobservable dimensions, such as expectations of income and house prices, personal preferences etc. As a result, the causal effects in our study are more reliable than theirs.====The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 discusses the LTV policy implemented in New Zealand and provides some information on the considerations that motivated its implementation and subsequent changes.

The emphases are on the last decade, rather than earlier; and the United States, rather than the rest of the world. The approach is more idiosyncratic than encyclopedic. The field has been converging on the conclusion that housing subsidies are the most attractive policy for reducing homelessness, but the optimal arrangement of subsidies is not obvious. Economists have much to contribute, in both theory—mechanism design and general equilibrium—and empirics. Aggregate-level studies can be used more for finding out what the effects of different policies are, and individual-level studies can be used more for assessing the costs and benefits of those effects.","The modern era of homelessness in the United States began almost forty years ago, on December 5, 1979, when New York State Supreme Court Justice Andrew R. Tyler ruled in favor of Robert Callahan, Clayton W. Fox, and Thomas Damian Roig, “three destitute and homeless men, in behalf of all the destitute homeless derelicts roaming the neighborhood of the Bowery.” He found that “the Bowery derelicts are entitled to board and lodging,” and ordered the State and City of New York to “submit a plan to provide at least 750 beds (and board for 750 men) for the helpless and hopeless men of the Bowery, in addition” to the existing facilities (Callahan et. al. v. Carey, Sup. Ct. N.Y. County, Cot. 18, 1979).====For close to a decade after this decision, economists published nothing about homelessness. Freeman and Hall, 1987, Quigley, 1990, and Honig and Filer (1993) were the seminal papers.====When I started to study homelessness in the early 1990s, it took me about half an hour to get up to speed on the economics literature. Economists who come to the subject today don't have the same luxury (and today New York City shelters close to 60,000 people a night, compared with under 2000 when Justice Tyler rendered his decision). The purpose of this essay is to make it a little easier for someone starting to work on homelessness today to accomplish what I did in half an hour in the early 1990s.====I will summarize some of the major findings, describe some of the useful data sets, and mainly look at open questions and how they could be addressed. The emphasis will be on more recent papers,==== and on the United States (with some references to Australia, since that country has some of the best data sets and has been the source of the some of the most interesting papers in the past few years). The approach will be closer to idiosyncratic than encyclopedic.====The second section looks at definitions, the third at individual-level studies, and the fourth, at aggregate-level studies. Section 5 is about prevention, since both individual-level and aggregate-level studies have been done on this topic. The final section concentrates on open questions: the stunning rises of homelessness this decade in New York City and Los Angeles County, the large falls in homelessness among veterans, and the continuing question of why modern homelessness is so heavily concentrated on African Americans.",Homelessness research: A guide for economists (and friends),https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137718302109,16 January 2019,2019,Research Article,163.0

We estimate these effects using two different comparison groups. Our first comparison group consists of children living in households that receive housing assistance starting four years after our treatment group—we use observations from those students’ pre-receipt years as the basis for the comparison. Our second comparison group consists of low-income students whose families never received housing assistance, but did receive other forms of means-tested benefits, such as SNAP, TANF, or Medicaid. Overall, our results suggest a positive relationship between housing assistance and math achievement, but the magnitude of this relationship is modest and not consistently statistically significant. We provide evidence that this relationship varies by student race and by type of housing assistance—a voucher or public housing. Throughout, we find little evidence of any relationship between housing assistance and student reading scores.","Federal housing assistance programs were originally intended to improve the housing stability and quality of low-income households, and on this score these program are generally considered a success. In recent years, however, scholars have identified several features of housing assistance programs that have the potential to shape a number of other recipient outcomes. For example, researchers have highlighted that housing assistance often induces residential mobility, which has the potential be both beneficial and disruptive to recipient households. They have also noted the income effects—including the incentives surrounding work and earnings—inherent in the design of housing assistance programs. Such recognition has served as the foundation for a series of studies examining how housing assistance affects a wide range of recipient outcomes, including earnings and employment, neighborhood quality, household composition, and receipt of public assistance, among others.====This paper continues that tradition, examining how housing assistance may shape the educational outcomes of children in recipient households. In particular, we estimate the effect of housing assistance on academic achievement as measured by standardized tests, comparing children in recipient households to similar children whose households have not received housing assistance or who received housing assistance in later years. The basis of our analysis is a unique dataset containing information on a large sample of low-income families with school-aged children residing in the state of Wisconsin. We use these data to estimate the effects of housing assistance receipt using two different comparison groups. Our first comparison group consists of children living in households that receive housing assistance beginning four years after the treatment group initially received assistance—we use observations from comparison students’ pre-receipt years as the basis for the contrast. Our second comparison group consists of low-income students whose families did not receive housing assistance at the time, but who did receive other forms of means-tested benefits, such as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), or Medicaid. Results of our analysis provide evidence that family receipt of housing assistance is tied to small increases in math scores, with these increases concentrated among black students. We also find some evidence that, relative to public housing assistance, receiving a voucher is associated with greater achievement gains, particularly in math.====We proceed by first describing the characteristics of the housing assistance programs whose effects we analyze, followed by a description of our conceptual framework. We then review the prior research on the relationship between housing assistance and children's educational outcomes. Next, we describe our unique dataset, our approach to constructing each of our two comparison groups, and the research methods that we employ.

Standard capital investment theory states that the market rental price of capital services will equal the user cost of capital in equilibrium. The empirical evidence in support of the rent-user cost equivalence theorem is, however, scarce if not non-existent. We examine the relationship between market rents and the user cost of rental properties based on a unique micro data set on the earnings and costs of Flemish landlords. Robust regression estimates of portfolio-average rental earnings on portfolio-average user costs point to a strong correspondence at the micro-level. In some cases, we find a user cost coefficient which is not significantly different from one together with an intercept estimate which is not significantly different from zero even when we control for landlord characteristics.","The fundamentals of house prices have always received a considerable amount of attention in the economics literature and this only increased after the burst of the housing bubble in the U.S. in 2007. However, a comparative study of the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies shows that in many developed countries more than twenty percent of all households rely on the private rental market for the provision of their housing services (Carliner and Marya, 2016). Furthermore, the majority of these households are often situated in the lower tiers of the income distribution and have to spend more than a quarter of their income on rent. Given its importance for such a large and economically vulnerable group of people, it is surprising that the research concerning the fundamentals of rental prices is limited. There exists, however, a fundamental which is often used as a proxy for market rents in theoretical and empirical work. Indeed, standard capital investment theory states that the rental price of capital services will equal the user cost of capital in equilibrium.==== In case of the housing market, the theorem implies that the market rent should equal the user cost of the rental property.====The rent-user cost equivalence theorem has a long-standing history in housing economics. It was first of all used to assess the impact of shocks in tax and monetary policy on various outcomes like house prices (Poterba, 1984), capital allocation (Hendershott, Hu, 1981, Hendershott, Hu, 1983) and tenure choice (Hendershott, Shilling, 1982, Follain, Ling, 1988). As models of the housing market became more advanced, the user cost remained an important component. DiPasquale and Wheaton (1992) specify an econometric model of the rental market in which the user cost of owner-occupied and rental housing affect respectively the demand and the construction of rental housing. Alm and Follain (1994) examine the effect of tax reform on the price of rental housing in a structural model of the rental market using a short-form user cost formulation including the interest rate and depreciation. A similar formulation as Gervais (2002) uses in his study on the impact of the preferential tax treatment of owner-occupied housing.==== These authors implicitly, or explicitly, assume that rents and user costs are strongly related and shocks in the latter translate one-to-one into the former. Whether market rents truly reflect the user cost of rental properties is essentially an empirical question.====The first study that looked directly at the relationship between market rents and user costs was Blackley and Follain (1996). The authors found that rental prices adjust only partially to shocks in user costs after a long period of time. Alarmed by surging house prices, Himmelberg et al. (2005) investigate whether the housing market had departed from equilibrium by comparing the evolution in the annual user of housing relative to rents and income. Their results suggest that user costs and rents do not share a stable relationship but that both variables can strongly deviate from one another. Verbrugge (2008) show that user costs are indeed much more volatile than rents and that both variables diverge from each other over extended periods of time. The results of these studies suggest that the housing market departed from equilibrium, but given the length of the time period of these studies it may be unreasonable to believe that the market never once reached its steady state.====Hence, these findings might not indicate a permanent or structural departure from equilibrium but rather demonstrate that the theoretical model underlying the rent-user cost equivalence does not hold in reality. Hall-Jorgenson investment theory assumes that capital markets are frictionless, but in reality there are various frictions that make the assumption of a perfect competitive housing market less realistic. Rosen and Smith (1983) already suggested that transaction and search costs, supply restrictions, the existence of long-term contracts and credit-market imperfections can cause the market to adjust slowly and even prevent rents from reaching the market-clearing level. The equilibrium relationship of rents and user costs is thus based on a set of particular stringent assumptions concerning the efficiency of the housing market.====However, one thing these previous studies all have in common is that their empirical analysis of the equilibrium relationship is based on rent and house price indices. A flawed theoretical outcome could explain their empirical findings, but it is also possible that the aggregate data hide a much tighter relationship at the micro level. Not only are rent and price indices often constructed in a different manner, the average rental property differs in its characteristics and location from the average property that is being sold.==== These inconcistencies lead to what Smith and Smith (2006) refer to as a comparison of apples to oranges. The latter concerns urged researchers to look for property-level data. Garner and Verbrugge (2009) examine the relationship between rents and user costs of owner-occupied housing using property-specific cost components from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES). The authors find that the reported rents are closely related to a user cost measure in which inflation is used as a proxy for the expected capital gain. Using a large data set of prices and rents from Sydney, Hill and Syed (2016) estimate several hedonic models to impute ‘quality-adjusted’ price-to-rent ratios of individual properties. In the end, the authors compare the median price-to-rent ratio to their measure of the per dollar user cost of owner-occupied housing. They conclude that the price-to-rent ratio was above its equilibrium level nearly the entire sample period.====Although these studies use micro data to analyse the rent-user cost relationship, each has its own limitations. The analysis of Garner and Verbrugge is based on owners’ equivalent rent (OER) which do not represent market rents at arm’s length. Their results depend on the ability of owner-occupiers to assess the market rent of their own house. The findings of Hill and Syed might not be informative if rental and owner-occupied markets are strongly segmented and the user cost or owner-occupied housing differs from the user cost of rental housing. If these markets are segmented, it is theoretically unclear whether the market rental price should indeed reflect the former and not the latter. Díaz and Luengo-Prado (2008) show that the preferential tax treatment of owner-occupied housing can create a large wedge between rental prices and user costs in the U.S. Moreover, segmentation makes the imputation of rental prices for owner-occupied housing less reliable despite the efforts of the authors to correct for possible biases.====In this paper, we are able to study the relationship between rents and user costs of rental properties thanks to a new survey called the Flemish Housing Survey (FHS). The survey was executed on behalf of the Flemish government and questions over 10,000 Flemish households about their housing conditions. Landlords in the FHS report the gross earnings of their rental portfolio, its market value, the property tax, expenses on maintenance and repairs, and the fire insurance. We use this information together with what we believe to be reasonable values for the other cost components to compute portfolio-specific user costs. Using robust regression methods to control for the presence of outliers in the sample, we then formally test whether rental earnings are on average equal to user costs.====Our results show that rents and user costs are much stronger related than what has been apparent in the empirical work up to now. In some cases, we even find a user cost coefficient which is not significantly different from one together with an intercept estimate which is not significantly different from zero. These results can be considered as evidence of the equivalence theorem since they suggest that rental earnings are, on average, equal to user costs. Controlling for landlord characteristics does not alter this conclusion. A closer look at the relationship between the earnings and the individual cost components reveals that observing both the rental price and the market value of the same property is one the key ingredients for an accurate analysis.====The rest of this article is organised as follows. Section 2 discusses the annual user cost of a Belgian rental property and two important frictions that can affect its relationship with rents. Section 3 presents the data of the main empirical analysis of which the results are discussed in Section 4. Section 5 presents the results of the time-series analysis.

To examine participation in property tax relief programs, we match loan-level HECM origination records with local administrative tax records for properties in Chicago, IL. We find that nearly 40% of eligible HECM borrowers do not participate in a senior tax relief program for which they meet all eligibility requirements. Further, we find that senior tax relief participation is associated with a reduced probability of property tax default of 60%.","A reverse mortgage allows homeowners to withdrawal equity with no repayment requirement until the home is vacated. The Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM), the most prevalent reverse mortgage product, is insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). A 2016 actuarial review on behalf of the FHA mutual mortgage insurance fund found that 17.5% of Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) loans had a history of property tax and insurance delinquency (Integrated Financial Engineering, 2016). The occurrence of delinquency is greater for HECM loans than the general population. For example, CoreLogic estimates the national tax delinquency rate to be 2.6% for properties with a mortgage (Cannon, 2015). Moulton et al. (2015) find property tax amount and property taxes as a share of income (property tax burden) to be highly predictive of severe property tax default among HECM borrowers. One way to reduce the property tax burden is for HECM borrowers to participate in property tax relief programs.====The relatively high rate of property tax delinquency for HECM loans has implications on the long-term viability of the program. Recent changes to the HECM, including initial disbursement limits and financial assessments, were meant to place the program on a more secure financial footing.==== The recent changes are important, but more remains to be done to directly address the risk associated with property tax delinquency and default.====This paper examines the participation of HECM borrowers in a senior tax relief program for which they meet all eligibility requirements, and estimates the probability of default given participation. To do so, we match loan-level records of HECM borrowers with parcel-level property tax records, and control for characteristics that are correlated with senior tax relief participation and property tax default. The analysis is restricted to HECM loans in Chicago, IL for seven tax years: taxes payable in 2011 through 2017.====We find that roughly 40% of HECM borrowers were not participating in the senior tax relief program despite fully qualifying by meeting minimum age and occupancy requirements. By not participating in the senior tax relief program, HECM borrowers forego, on average, a $328 reduction in annual tax bills. Further, we find that single-male HECM borrowers are less likely than HECM borrowers with a coborrowers to claim the senior tax relief. We also find that participating in the senior tax relief programs is associated with a 60% reduction in the likelihood of property tax default.====To our knowledge this is the first paper to examine HECM borrower participation in property tax relief programs. The study is intended to provide insight into HECM property tax delinquency and the potential for reducing borrower property tax burden, and the cost of property tax default for the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).",Reverse mortgages and senior property tax relief,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137718300949,7 December 2018,2018,Research Article,166.0

In the short-term, the subjective well-being score increases by about one point (on an eleven-point scale) on average, indicating the positive effects of ownership and confirming previous research. The long-term ownership effects, however, are considerably smaller, and owners perceive their subjective well-being to be about 0.7 points higher than before they bought their home. The results provide an explanation for this difference: individuals tend to adapt to their new housing situations after they have bought a home. The size of these ownership effects varies across different groups.","The decision to buy a home is important for many households. There is a wide preference for homeownership compared to renting a home. As a result, in the Western world the rate of homeownership is high and it has risen substantially since the Second World War (e.g. Clark et al., 1997, Gabriel and Rosenthal, 2005) although some countries like Germany and Switzerland did experience a much smaller increase. Many individuals characterize homeownership as their “dream” and for many households it certainly is an important life goal (see Beracha and Johnson (2012)). Whether the realization of this dream is perceived by individuals to have a higher utility in the short-term and the long-term is the main topic of this article.====There is broad research that partially answers this question. Much research is devoted to the positive and negative consequences of homeownership (e.g. Dietz and Haurin (2003)) and provides indirect evidence on the utility question. Along with other factors, homeownership is often credited with higher self–esteem (Dietz and Haurin, 2003), better child development (Green and White, 1997), a positive impact on social activities (DiPasquale and Glaeser, 1999) and neighborhood stability (Rohe and Stewart, 1996). From a financial perspective, homeownership provides a hedge against rent risk (Sinai and Souleles, 2005). Homeowners also display a greater tendency to customize their homes to their own needs and tastes (e.g. Gebhardt (2013)). Renters, in contrast, may be less motivated to customize. Potential reasons are landlords who prohibit customization, and large investments that are necessary for customization cannot be reaped by the renters when they leave their units (Henderson and Ioannides, 1983). Despite the positive effects, there is also research that challenges the advantage of ownership. For example, Beracha and Johnson (2012) argue that from a financial perspective, renting in the United States can be a better housing choice than buying. The financial perspective has also been addressed earlier (e.g. Mills (1990)). Buying a home usually involves a large portion of an average household's wealth and therefore can have a substantial impact on its disposable income. As a result, households with a high stake of their wealth in their home are often badly diversified (Cocco, 2005). Owning a house is related to lower mobility (selling a house may be accompanied by higher transaction costs than leaving a rented dwelling) and, therefore, may translate to lower labor mobility (Munch et al., 2008). Whether the positive and negative effects of an individual are a zero-sum game or whether homeownership is associated with a higher perceived utility has as yet not been fully answered since earlier studies frequently face some limitations on the data and the resulting econometric approaches. The first limitation is that earlier studies often analyze one-time surveys as large panel data sets have been available only recently. The second limitation is that some analyses are prone to potential omitted variable bias. As a result, the early evidence on the perceived utility of homeownership should be interpreted with caution.====Recently, the availability of large panel data sets has provided the opportunity to tackle these limitations. Typically, individuals are regularly (mainly at a yearly frequency) asked how satisfied they are with certain domains of life (such as housing). This satisfaction level is known as subjective well-being (SWB) and is a well-accepted measure of perceived utility. Next to SWB measures, many individual and housing characteristics are also recorded in these surveys. A recent study that uses a large panel data set is by Diaz-Serrano (2009). Based on 15 EU countries from 1994 to 2001, his research focus is on the immediate change in SWB after renters have bought a home (immediate ownership effect = IOE). His research provides strong evidence that in the year when renters buy their home, the residential SWB rises significantly.====The restriction to one-year changes in SWB has some limitations as it is conceivable that long-term ownership effects (LOE: changes in SWB over several years) differ from IOEs. Thus, individuals may adapt to their new ownership status or to their new home situation. The issue of adaptation seems to be relevant as previous research has shown that important events in life have a large immediate effect on SWB, but there is a tendency for the effects to be short-lived (Kahneman and Thaler, 2006). One potential explanation they put forward is the withdrawal of attention. After a major event, an individual focuses her attention largely on the new situation. When new situations, however, lose their novel character, an individual tends to withdraw her attention from it and, as a result, a mechanism of adaptation comes into play. Adaptation works for good and bad events (e.g. winning a lottery, marriage, becoming a paraplegic, widowhood, divorce, unemployment; see Diener et al., 2006, Clark et al., 2008, Luhmann et al., 2012).==== Surprisingly, there is little research on the adaptation effect of becoming a homeowner, although buying a home is a major life goal of many individuals. One exception is Rohe and Basolo (1997), who find that there is still a positive ownership effect three years after the purchase. However, their study is limited to low-income families and considers just two points in time. Thus, adaptation may lower the long-term perceived benefits compared to the ownership benefits measured by the IOE. The analysis of the IOE, LOE and adaptation effect (ADE) is the central issue of this study.====The analysis pays particular attention to a potential endogenous relationship between housing SWB and ownership effects. Therefore, we use an instrumental variable approach to estimate ownership effects. Changing housing policy over time thereby serves as an instrument. The idea of the instrument is that during times when there is a generous subsidy policy, obtaining ownership should be easier than during times with no particular subsidy. We also analyze whether the pattern of ownership effects is stable across individuals. Since individuals may have different preferences regarding, for example, housing characteristics (e.g. one may prefer a large home another may prefer a medium-sized home), this is an important issue which has been largely neglected in previous studies. Therefore, we follow different approaches. First, we divide the total sample into various subsamples on individual characteristics like age and allow for different group preferences. Second, we analyze various ways to become a homeowner. A household can buy or inherit a home. Also, a household can buy the home it has previously rented or it can buy a home not previously rented (i.e. new home). Comparing the ownership effects of the subgroups addresses the issue whether adaptation is to the new housing situation or to the new ownership status. Finally, instead of dividing the total sample into separate groups, we model preferences of a single individual by using his or her preference characteristics about objective housing variables such as housing condition, size and costs. We analyze our research questions by making use of the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) which is a widely analyzed panel data set in the subjective well-being literature. This data set is larger than previous ones in some aspects and therefore allows a more detailed analysis of the perceived benefits of ownership. Also, the German housing market is known for a low ownership rate compared to the rest of the Western world (Voigtländer, 2009) and thereby provides an interesting opportunity to analyze whether in a country with low ownership rates homeownership is perceived to be as beneficial as in countries with high ownership rates (such as the United States).====Our results suggest that the ownership effect in the long-term is lower than that in the short-term, while the IOE is large and ownership is associated with an increase in the housing SWB of up to 10% (increase in SWB points normalized with the scale range of SWB). This increase is about the same as the results presented by Diaz-Serrano (2009). However, the LOE is substantially smaller. After five years the increase is considerably reversed by about 26%. We also report that adaption effects are not observed for those individuals who buy their previously rented home. Thereby, our results suggest that individuals adapt to the new housing situation rather than to the ownership status. This may support the view of Kahneman and Thaler (2006) who argue that adaptation can be explained with the withdrawal of attention to a new situation. A further result of our analysis suggests that becoming an owner via an active decision (i.e. buying) is associated with a substantially larger IOE (about 10% increase) than via a passive decision (i.e. inheriting) where the IOE is only a 2.5% increase. Also, young home buyers display a substantially larger IOE than older individuals (increase above 10% versus below 3%), and the LOE of individuals living in a low-income household are substantially greater than that of high income households. Thus, while the pattern of ownership effect is similar across different groups of individuals, the estimated size of the ownership effects differs. We then discuss policy implications and evaluate the German housing policy using the empirical results.====The paper proceeds as follows. In section two we discuss methodological issues. Section three describes the data and presents summary statistics. Section four presents the empirical results on the ownership effect and adaptation effects. Section five discusses policy implications and section six concludes.",The perception of homeownership utility: Short-term and long-term effects,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137716302169,22 November 2018,2018,Research Article,167.0

A comprehensive measure of welfare should include the consumption value derived from consumer durables like housing (Smeeding and Weinberg, 2001). Ireland is used as a case study, to examine the impact of housing costs and benefits on the spatial distribution of income.====A broader definition of household income will include more than employment income but also include non-monetary components and in-kind benefits such as imputed rent (Frick and Grabka, 2003, Frick et al., 2007). Two aspects of housing make it interesting, its costs and benefits. The costs are in the form of; rent, mortgage payments or house purchase and benefits; imputed rent and reverse mortgage payments (Nakajima and Telyukova, 2014). Being an owner-occupier does not provide a rental income however, it saves the owner from having to pay market rent (Atkinson, 1983). This should be reflected in total household income.====Net imputed rent consists of gross imputed rent, less any expenditure on maintenance and mortgage interest paid (Frick et al., 2007). For gross imputed rent, the market rent for a similar type dwelling, should be used (UN, 1977). This reflects the hedonic nature of housing (Rosen, 1974). The Canberra Group (UN, 2011) proposed guidelines on how to measure household income and believes in-kind gains such as, property income from net imputed rent should be included. Since 2008, imputed rent and reverse mortgage/annuity values are included in the United Nations system of national accounts (UN, 2008), while the Central Statistics Office (CSO), Ireland publish a net imputed rent measure in the national accounts (CSO, 2011) however this is at an aggregated spatial scale.====Previous studies found imputed rent to have an equalising effect on the income distribution (Saunders and Siminski, 2005, Fessler et al., 2016), these studies however, have been restricted to an aspatial scale due to a lack of income data with a spatial component (Balcázar et al., 2014). Aspatial analysis of imputed rent ignores the spatial variation in house prices. If poor people live-in low-cost areas and rich people live in high cost areas, then the distributional effects of adding imputed rent (as an ‘income’ source) to household income cannot be measured accurately with nationwide imputations as there are large variation between areas.====Regional science offers explanations as to how and why variations in wages and house prices exist across space across space. Thünen (1826) recognised that an interaction exists between space and the economy, the rent for agricultural land rent is a function of yield per unit of land and transport costs. The Alonso, 1964, Muth, 1969 and Mills (1972) model extended von Thünen's model to an urban environment. This is based on the idea that differences in commuting costs are traded off with differences in the price of living space (Brueckner, 1987). Alonso used bid rent curves to show how households with a given income and set of preferences seek to trade-off the costs and nuisance of commuting, with the advantages of cheaper land with increasing distance to the city centre and the satisfaction of having more living space (Alonso, 1960). The densities, location and prices of urban land are all determined simultaneously. Rich households will have flatter bid rent curves compared to poor households, they also have a higher consumption for housing which attracts them to the suburbs. (Brueckner et al., 1999). At any given location the rich can afford more land and other goods compared to poor households. Poor households are less concerned with the price and quantity of land and more focused on cost and inconvenience of commuting - “Accessibility behaves as an inferior good” (Alonso, 1960).====Regional wage differences can be explained by differences in local amenities (Roback, 1982) and agglomeration economies (Rosenthal and Strange, 2004). The Rosen–Roback specification defines a spatial equilibrium where differences in housing costs account for differences in income and amenities for each individual (Glaeser and Gyourko, 2005). Individuals are trading-off commuting, housing and income simultaneously to maximize their welfare. The spatial pattern of amenities in a city can help to explain why rich income groups live at central locations or in the suburbs. When the level of amenities in the centre are high the rich are more likely to live there (Brueckner et al., 1999). Holding human capital constant, high wages result in higher costs to firms. The spatial equilibrium suggests there is advantages to firms in high wage areas, which offset the costs of conducting business (Glaeser, 2007). Spatial models capture the fact that the residuals produced by hedonic house price equations are often spatially correlated (Balcázar et al., 2017). Despite the availability of detailed house information, previous studies on small area imputed rent have been constrained by a lack of income data at a small area level.====Examining the spatial differences in income and house prices and how they impact on a household's overall level of income is the main objective of this study. A spatial microsimulation approach is used to overcome the lack of income data at a small area level (O'Donoghue et al., 2013a). This dataset is combined with a kriging methodology (Brunsdon and Comber, 2015) to calculate the spatial impact of net imputed rent on the spatial distribution of income.",The impact of housing consumption value on the spatial distribution of welfare,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137718301293,March 2019,2019,Research Article,168.0

While there is a body of literature on the effects of proximity to dams and reservoirs on housing prices, little known research attempts to determine if various individual houses are impacted differently depending on their locations and years of sale. We examine properties in Barkhamsted, Connecticut that sold between 2000 and 2015. We utilize non-parametric regression to allow for the possibility that bodies of water, dams and undevelopable land areas, affect various ==== differently, depending on their locations and when they are sold. We find that in general, undevelopable land area is valued as a disamenity in this rural town. With our semi-parametric estimation approach, we find the signs of the effects of proximity to the nearest body of water vary – some properties benefit from proximity while others experience lower sale prices when they are closer to water. But on average, being far from the water lowers property values, after controlling for flood risk from being below the nearest dam. In other words, residents prefer to live near waterfronts. We also control for other key housing characteristics and environmental variables, such as elevation relative to the nearest dam, numbers of bedrooms and baths, age of properties, year of sale, square footage and acreage, and others. We plot the parameter estimates over time for some variables to demonstrate how the spatial heterogeneity changes after the recession that began in late 2008.","Proximity to reservoirs and dams can have both positive and negative impacts on house prices. For instance, reservoirs can be considered “amenities” due to open space, wildlife, and aesthetics/views. On the other hand, there can be a higher risk of flooding near reservoirs and at elevations lower than nearby dams, which can be capitalized into house prices and lead to lower property values. An understanding of the potential positive and negative impacts of living near reservoirs, dams, and undevelopable land due to relatively steep slope, is important in justifying the operation of water (and possibly other) utilities near residential properties.====While there is a body of literature on the effects of proximity to dams and reservoirs on housing prices, little known research attempts to determine if various individual houses are impacted differently depending on their locations and years of sale. Also, relatively little is known about how proximity to these amenities affects house prices differently during a “boom” period versus a “bust” period. We examine all 495 arms-length single family residential property sales in Barkhamsted, Connecticut between 2000 and 2015. This sample covers a period of a significant housing boom (2002–2009) and also a bust (the housing crisis which began in 2009).====The reservoir in Barkhamsted supplies much of central Connecticut with its drinking water. We utilize non-parametric regression techniques (Geographically Weighted Regressions) to allow for the possibility that the major reservoir and dams in Barkhamsted affect various house prices differently, depending on their locations and when they are sold. Our nonparametric (and semi-parametric) approaches allow for a more general functional form for these relationships, compared with OLS. In other words, at some locations in Barkhamsted, we find that proximity to water enhances property values while in other locations property values rise with greater distance from water. In contrast, OLS estimation leads to a result that all properties are affected equally by being closer to water. This flexibility is a key advantage of our nonparametric approach.====We follow a similar approach of Saiz (2010) and generate estimates of land with sufficiently steep slopes that inhibit development. We also estimate a set of partial linear (i.e., semi-parametric) models. We find that for the most part, proximity to dams with higher elevation than a particular property leads to lower housing sale price for that property, with the magnitudes of these effects varying across geographic space and over time. Properties with higher census block steep slope land area tend to sell for lower prices, implying this type of land is a disamenity in this rural town.====The signs of the effects of proximity to the reservoir vary – some properties benefit from proximity while others experience lower sale prices when they are closer to the reservoir. We also control for other key housing characteristics and environmental variables, such as elevation relative to the nearest dam, numbers of bedrooms and baths, age of properties, year of sale, square footage and acreage, and others. We generate figures showing the range of the coefficients for several of the key variables to illustrate the heterogeneity (e.g., see Fig. 3).====The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. First, we review the literature on proximity to wetlands, dams, and water bodies. Then we describe our empirical approaches, followed by a discussion of the data.

Existing housing literature models the probability of a house sale using mainly property characteristics or ====, may aid in modeling house sales.====Incorporating the property characteristics, mortgage origination variables, and locational factors increases the pseudo-","Explaining whether an individual house sold or not over some time interval is of interest in at least three areas of real estate research. First, if houses sold are not a random sample from the population of all houses, sample selection bias could be an issue. Inferences drawn from the selected sample of sold houses could lead to biased parameter estimates and erroneous inferences about either the contribution of individual characteristics or the trajectory of real estate prices over time such as measured by a transaction price based house price index (e.g., Gatzlaff, Haurin, 1997, Gatzlaff, Haurin, 1998, Fisher, Gatzlaff, Geltner, Haurin, 2003).====Second, a house sale automatically results in the prepayment of the mortgage, because of the due on sale clauses in mortgages. This form of mortgage termination competes with other mutually exclusive mortgage decisions such as default, refinancing, or payment (e.g., Kau, Keenan, 1995, Deng, Quigley, Order, 2000, Clapp, Goldberg, Harding, LaCour-Little, 2001, Ong, 2000). Therefore, factors that affect the sale of the house also affect these other decisions and thus modeling of these decisions.====Third, housing transactions provide another measure of the state of the market. For example, the Pending Sales Index from the National Association of Realtors (NAR) is widely viewed as an indicator of housing market conditions. Like the MSA Median Price index from the NAR, this index is also not adjusted for variables that differ across markets. This suggests examining the aggregate house sale probability for submarkets after controlling for important factors could also be used as an improved measure of real estate market liquidity.====Despite of the importance of housing sales, papers that explicitly model the probability of house sales, especially at the individual property-level, are rare (Johnson et al., 2007). At the aggregate level, literature indicates that market conditions may influence housing market transactions (e.g., Qian, 2013; Fu, Qian, 2014, Chan, 2001). While macroeconomic conditions are important factors affecting the house sales, this study focuses on the contribution of individual property/borrower characteristics in individual level house sales.====Property-level house sale models normally appear as the first stage regression of the Heckman two-stage model in the house price index sample selection literature (e.g., Gatzlaff, Haurin, 1997, Gatzlaff, Haurin, 1998, Fisher, Gatzlaff, Geltner, Haurin, 2003). In the residential real estate literature, house sale models rely mainly on housing variables. Typically, it has been difficult to obtain a good fit of the probability of a transaction as a function of housing variables. As the fit becomes worse and worse, a probit or logit model will basically default to showing that each property has a 1/==== probability of sale and this either indicates that sample selection is not a problem (e.g., Munneke, Slade, 2000, Jud, Seaks, 1994) or that the empirical approach taken is inadequate to address the issue.====To understand the low effect of property characteristics on the probability of a house sale, we introduce a simple theoretical model. This model shows that if potential buyers and sellers place similar values on characteristics such as living area or house age, property characteristics by themselves may not materially affect the probability of a sale.====Mortgage borrowers/homeowners make house sale decisions. Their characteristics such as their time horizon of staying in the house or life cycle stage should play a role in the house sale decision (e.g., Ortalo-Magn and Rady, 2006).==== Although typically such information is difficult to obtain, it is reasonable to assume that mortgage choices made at loan origination should reflect borrower housing preferences (Chambers et al., 2009). Public mortgage records provide a convenient source of such origination variables. For example, public records contain information on whether individuals refinance. Given everything else is the same, individuals who expect to continue stay in the same house are more likely to take advantage of the market refinance opportunities than individuals who expect to move in the near future. Thus, a recently refinanced borrower is more likely stay in the house for some time. Similarly, hybrid adjustable rate mortgages normally have a lower contract rate for initial payments, but also a higher interest rate risk in the long run. Individuals are more likely to select such products if they expect to stay in the house for a shorter time period, holding everything else constant. Therefore, financial choices made by homeowners reveal some information about their anticipated future tenure in the house.====In addition, we investigate whether location matters in the house sales decision by explicitly modeling both the measurable characteristics of neighbors, and the locationally related omitted variables (as captured by the geographic clustering of sales). Some of these factors have been discussed in the housing tenure literature. However, whether and to what extent these pre-determined variables could help explain the individual house sale model in a given time period is not yet clear.==== For example, although location is an important factor in housing decisions, because of the computational challenge, it was until recently thought almost impossible to implement formal spatial probit model empirically (Pace and Sage, 2016).====Using the public transaction data for single family properties from Clark County in Nevada and Maricopa County in Arizona, this manuscript examines the performances of modeling the probability of sale as a function of property characteristics, loan characteristics,==== and location information. In a cross sectional setting, we investigate whether and how these variables affect house sales. We find that mortgage variables greatly enhance the explanatory power of the probit model. For example, in year 2010, property characteristics alone do not perform well with a pseudo-==== of 0.42 percent while loan characteristics alone give a pseudo-==== of 17.79 percent. Using both property and loan variables yields a pseudo-==== of 21.00 percent. Many of the inferences concerning the property characteristics change after adding the mortgage information. The results hold well for different time periods, different areas, and a variety of sub samples. The results also indicate that the coefficients of the house sale model vary from year to year.====Locational factors, as captured by both neighborhood information and a spatially dependent disturbance term, are also important in determining house sales. For example, in year 2006, for the loan variables only model, the pseudo-==== increases from a 14.01 percent for the ==== model to a 16.82 percent for the spatial error dependent model, and to a 20.30 percent when including neighborhood information in the spatial model.====In summary, this study investigates at the individual property-level the relative roles played by property characteristics, seller mortgage origination variables, and location information in determining cross sectional house sales. Our theoretical model helps explain why housing characteristics have little explanatory power. Overall, our results show that mortgage and location information together increase the house sale model fit as of pseudo-==== from 0.76 percent to 23.02 percent, which is an over 30-fold improvement from the housing characteristics only ==== model.====This paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we introduce a simple theoretical model of the probability of house transactions that incorporates property and seller/buyer characteristics as well as a spatial econometrics model to explicitly incorporate location related variables.

We use MLS data from the Randstad area of the Netherlands for the period 2008–2013 for which we have detailed information regarding the listing strategies. We find that those homeowners who expect loss set higher initial list price by 10% on average than those homeowners who do not. Sellers with prospective loss upon initial listing are more likely and more aggressively to revise their list price downward than other sellers.","Do loss-bearing homeowners prefer cutting loss upon property listing over cutting list price at times of housing busts? Listing strategies, or the initial list price setting and associated list price revisions, is one of the classical problems concerning homeowners when selling their home. This is because sellers, when setting initial list price, call upon informed brokers and use the observed price of surrounding properties, and they never actually observe a demand curve. List price setting is not immaterial. As selling a home is typically about selling one’s largest financial asset, list price setting and revisions have long-term financial implications. Listing a house for sale has been referred to as the most agonizing and stressful decision associated with selling one’s home. This may seem particularly true for homeowners expecting to sell for less than their original (nominal) purchase price during market busts. It is the topic of this paper to compare listing strategies among homeowners who, during housing market downturn, expect potential loss when listing their property on the market vis-à-vis those who do not.====The issue of listing strategies connects to the dynamic search and pricing literature in which sellers learn about demand and set list price accordingly. Sellers, while waiting for potential buyers to arrive, may set and subsequently change their list price during the property marketing period (Knight, 2002, Herrin et al., 2004, Merlo and Ortalo-Magne, 2004, Haurin et al., 2010, Deng et al., 2012, De Wit and van der Klaauw, 2013; Bucchianeri and Minson, 2013). As compared to the rather established literature on listing strategies, little is known about listing strategies when sellers face potential loss and whether they decide to cut loss upon market entry, or cut list price subsequently. What has been observed by Genesove and Mayer (2001) is that lower market price than sellers’ initial nominal purchase price induce sellers to set higher list price upon market entry than the market price associated with prevailing market conditions.==== Sellers set list price at an above-average level in hope of selling at relatively high price in the end, thus cutting their loss. Given positive holding costs, however, sellers may subsequently lower list price as they learn about or are exposed to market conditions. This can possibly be understood in reference to demand uncertainty. Since most moves are local, with seller and buyer in the very same housing market, competition for informed buyers will erode any markup of list price over expected selling price (Balvers and Cosimano, 1990). In practice, during a housing market bust, setting a markup upon market entry may result in subsequent list price revisions. On the one hand, the list price setting due to prospective loss may intensify the pressure on sellers to increase their markup upon market entry. These sellers may then learn from the market and lower their reservation price to compete for potential buyers. While the reservation price is not observed, changes in it can be inferred from list price cutting, or withdrawal from the market.==== On the other hand, since listing strategies of sellers are bounded by the reference point below which disutility will be increasing and convex, list price revision may not be obvious if potential loss is expected.==== Overall, whether potential loss plays a role in determining list price cutting is, in part, an open question, and it constitutes the central question of this research.====In this paper, we investigate the effect of potential loss on list price updating. We postulate that, if changes in reservation price are reflected in list price updates, sellers who expect to sell at loss in the market downturn will be less inclined to respond to actual market conditions by revising their list price downward as compared to sellers who are likely to realize capital gains. This paper contributes to the literature in considering potential loss and its impact on list price dynamics. Previous studies of Genesove and Mayer (2001) and Anenberg (2011) have concentrated primarily on the effect of loss on initial list price and/or on final sales price, while neglecting the entire list price updating process in between. Their findings can be considered to be a mixture of both list price updating effect and bargaining effect. We use rich data to model listing dynamics, and focus on sellers who are subject to potential loss upon market entry and its implication on list price updating during the entire property listing stage, that is from the initial listing date to the date on which final list price is posted. While previous research predominately focuses on the U.S. housing market, the current research utilizes data from the Dutch housing market with unique market institutions. The Dutch housing market differs from the U.S. housing market in two notable aspects. First, the Dutch housing market is characterized by high loan-to-value as down-payment is not required by Dutch mortgage providers. Second, Dutch mortgages are structured with full recourse. As strategic defaults are not possible, the number of foreclosures has been negligible relative to the total amount of mortgages outstanding in the market throughout the Dutch housing market cycle.==== These institutional differences may lead to a different mechanism as to how equity position may affect list price setting by sellers. Comparing with sellers in the U.S. who tend to set high list price due to equity constraint and/or the embedded put option on non-recourse mortgages, the recourse mortgage structure may be the single source of constraint that affect list price setting by Dutch sellers. Further, as compared to the previous literature that employs standard hedonic regression specification to estimate the expected property sales price in order to measure the prospective loss faced by sellers on the date of market entry, we propose to use the spatial-temporal autoregressive (STAR) model to predict the expected property sales price. The STAR model incorporates not only the housing structural attributes, but also the information concerning the housing spatial neighbors that have been sold previously when predicting the expected sales price of the subject property, which yields better predication precision as compared to the standard hedonic model.==== Lastly, this paper complements the extensive existing literature on list price revision, for instance, Balvers and Cosimano, 1990, Knight, 2002, Herrin et al., 2004, Yang and Ye, 2008, Haurin et al., 2010, Deng et al., 2012 and De Wit and Van der Klaauw (2013). While these papers generally neglect the impact of potential loss on the list price updating process, we emphasize on the list price revision revealed by sellers who face potential loss upon initial listing.====Our findings for the Netherlands during the 2008–2013 housing bust support earlier findings for the U.S. housing market as reported by Genesove and Mayer (2001) and Anenberg (2011). While we find larger effect of prospective loss on initial list price for the Netherlands during the recent bust, we also show that, as compared to sellers who are not bounded by expected loss on the date of initial property listing, sellers expecting loss are more likely to revise list price downward. It indicates that sellers seem to respond to market conditions after the property is listed, despite prospective loss. Furthermore, given the occurrence of list price revision, sellers who face potential loss are more aggressive in cutting list price than those who do not. We report positive impact of potential loss on final list price, which reflects that, despite the more aggressive list price updating revealed by sellers expecting loss upon initial listing, the impact of expected loss remains present in the entire property listing process. We find that our results are robust to heterogeneous samples of sellers’ motivation, sellers’ equity position, and property type.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

In addition to 11 crewmen losing their lives and numerous other rig operators sustaining injuries, the explosion left British Petroleum’s (BP) Macondo well severely damaged.==== An estimated 134 million gallons of oil spilled into the Gulf of Mexico over the next 87 days, and an additional 1.4 million gallons of chemical dispersant were spread on the resulting oil slick (Smithsonian Ocean Portal Team, 2016).==== The BP ==== oil spill is the largest off-shore oil spill in United States history (Deepwater Horizon Natural Resource Damage Assessment Trustees, 2016).==== It resulted in immense environmental damage throughout the Gulf; reduced aesthetic amenities and the general livability of the area; harmed coastal economies reliant on the Gulf for fishing, recreation, and tourism; and potentially affected the health of citizens in five different states in ways that are not yet fully known.==== Bishop et al. (2017) estimate that the total willingness to pay to avoid a similar disaster exceeds $17 billion.====In contrast to the negative effects of the spill, BP spent an estimated $44 billion on cleanup and legal costs, and, in late 2015, reached a $20.8 billion dollar agreement to settle all federal, Gulf Coastal state, and local government claims (Gilbert, Kent, 2015, Barrett, 2015).==== BP’s efforts to restore the natural habitats and compensate the citizens they harmed mitigated the effects of the spill and may have resulted in improvements to some community amenities in the affected areas.====While these effects cannot be quantified directly, economic theory dictates that local amenities and dis-amenities (either real or expected) are capitalized into property values (Rosen, 1974). We theorize that the BP oil spill diminished the demand for affected properties through the previously listed channels, but that the value of some homes in the area may have actually increased along some dimensions as a result of restitution efforts. To determine the net effect of the spill, we use a measure of annual housing market appreciation based on single-family home sales by ZIP Code developed by Bogin et al. (2016) and survey data on the location and severity of oil observed along over 4,300 miles of the Gulf Coast from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Environmental Response Management Application (ERMA) (MC-252 SCAT Program, 2014).==== We use Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques to spatially merge these datasets, then perform hedonic-style analysis in differences-in-differences (DD) and triple-difference (DDD) frameworks to determine the causal effects of oil from the spill capitalized by real estate markets along the Gulf Coast.====Hedonic models have long been used to quantify the effects of non-market amenities ranging from the negative effects of small-scale hazardous waste sites on property values (Ihlanfeldt and Taylor, 2004) to the premiums associated with high functioning school districts (Chiodo et al., 2010).==== Although these models are popular, Freeman III et al. (1993) and Deaton and Hoehn (2004) point out the difficulties of separately identifying the variable of interest from confounding factors. Recent work has used DD or DDD frameworks to identify, for instance, the effects of rising sea levels (Ortega and Taṣpinar, 2016), the impact of the redevelopment of contaminated lands (Haninger et al., 2014), and the effects of hydraulic fracturing (Muehlenbachs et al., 2015) with hedonic models. It is the tradition of these works that motivates our identification strategy.====Descriptive DD analyses suggest that the net effect of the oil spill was mostly limited to markets close to the coast. Additionally, the housing market bubble and correction, subprime mortgage crisis, and subsequent Great Recession (hereafter, we refer to these collective events as the housing market crash) confound estimation of the effects of the spill. Our descriptive analysis raises two important points and motivates our main specifications. In particular, it suggests the need for an empirical model that (i) accounts for the potentially localized effect of the oil spill without ignoring regional effects and (ii) addresses differences in the housing market crash experiences of coastal and inland markets not fully captured by available controls. These insights motivate a DDD analysis that accounts for differences between treated and unaffected communities, markets before and after the spill, and inland and coastal communities. We find strong evidence that suggests that this DDD specification effectively controls for changes in regional and macroeconomic conditions caused by the housing market crash.====DDD estimates show that the net effect of the oil spill caused a statistically significant decrease in home prices of 4–8% that persisted for at least five years. Back-of-the-envelope calculations indicate that the spill caused a minimum of $3.8 billion to $5.0 billion in damages that were capitalized by housing markets. Placebo and permutation tests support our findings, and our estimates are very robust to variations in the definition of coastal and inland areas. They are strongest in housing markets close to the coast and show a decaying effect of the spill as the treatment group expands inland, suggesting an intuitive, negative gradient in the effect of the oil spill. Additionally, we provide evidence consistent with more intense oil damage having a more negative effect on housing values, but we are unable to show conclusively that this is the case.====Generally, our work can be placed in a broad literature that uses hedonic analysis to estimate the effects of externalities on housing markets. More narrowly, we make at least four contributions to the existing literature on the BP oil spill itself. First, while researchers have studied the impact of the BP oil spill on local labor markets (Aldy, 2014), tourism (Whitehead et al., 2016), and advertising (Barrage et al., 2014), to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to plausibly estimate the effects of the spill on single-family housing markets across the entire Gulf Coastal region. Only Winkler and Gordon (2013) and Siegel et al. (2013) have studied the impact of the BP oil spill on housing markets in a systematic way. Both do so using condominiums and a very limited set of locations (the same coastal county in Alabama) in the short-run.==== We cover a different set of residential properties in all five Gulf States, and our analysis spans a longer time period.==== While both Winkler and Gordon (2013) and Siegel et al. (2013) find that the spill had negative effects similar in magnitude to our estimates, they also conclude that the effects of the spill were far more short-lived (on the order of three months) than our findings of effects that persist to 2015 indicate.====Second, and more importantly, unlike the pre versus post (single-difference) study methodologies used by Winkler and Gordon (2013) and Siegel et al. (2013), we use DDD specifications that allow us to compare changes in housing market outcomes in treated locations before and after the spill to changes in plausible control locations. As opposed to the previously cited before-after comparison analyses (that, by their nature, do not control for aggregate market effects), our empirical specification allows us to separately identify the effects of the spill from confounding housing market factors under plausible assumptions. Since our period of analysis coincides with the housing market crash, naive comparisons of home values in the pre- and post-spill periods that do not account for these changing market conditions against a reasonable benchmark are likely to misstate the true effect of the spill.====Third, while our research question is similar to those of Winkler and Gordon (2013) and Siegel et al. (2013), our empirical specification is most closely related to that of Aldy's (2014) analysis of the net impacts of the spill on labor markets. We improve upon the DD specification used by Aldy (2014) by incorporating detailed information on the actual oil damage experienced by coastal communities. As opposed to considering all Gulf Coastal locations as receiving an equal treatment, we are able to define multiple treatments based on whether a locality actually had oil wash up on its shores and how proximate the community was to observed shore oiling. We estimate models based on these definitions of treated communities in addition to one analogous to Aldy's (2014) definitions based on whether or not a jurisdiction is located in the NOAA defined coastal watershed.====Fourth, by using the ZIP Code/ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) as our unit of observation, we use a finer level of geography than the counties and parishes (hereafter, collectively referred to as counties) used by Aldy (2014).==== This allows us to better measure the outcomes of those affected by the spill by controlling for local housing market effects at the county level. These controls are particularly important given the concurrent and heterogeneous effects of the housing market crash during our period of analysis.====Section 2 discusses how we construct our estimation dataset. The following section details our empirical specification and presents our model estimates.

Underlying this concern is evidence showing that minorities perform better on standardized exams if they attend non-poor schools. One strategy to deconcentrate minorities within poor or low performing schools is to open up affordable housing opportunities within better school attendance zones (SAZs). In this paper I examine the efficacy of this approach using data on Florida elementary schools. I find that shifts in the proportion of a school district's affordable units in favor of better SAZs decrease the concentration of both black and Hispanic students in bad schools. However, different types of affordable units matter depending on the race of students and the definition of what constitutes a good school.","One of the major concerns with public education in the U.S. is that black and Hispanic students are concentrated in low performing schools where most of the students come from poor families. Orfield et al. (2012) report that in the early 2000s black and Hispanic students attended schools where somewhat more than 50% of their classmates received a free lunch because of low family income. What they find more disturbing is that less than ten years later this percentage had grown to over 66%. Underlying their concern is extensive research showing that students attain greater academic achievement if they attend schools where a majority of the students come from middle and high income families.==== The fact that minority students are underrepresented in these schools helps explain the large achievement gaps between them and their white counterparts.==== The importance of closing this gap cannot be overstated. In fact, two prominent experts on the issue, Jencks and Phillip (1998), have argued in their book ==== that closing the gap would probably do more to promote racial equality in the U.S. than any other strategy now under serious discussion. Not surprisingly, it follows that there is considerable interest in policies that would result in more minority students attending higher performing schools. Not only would the academic performance of those who move to better schools improve but this would also put competitive pressure on poor schools that wish to remain open to offer a better education to their students.====The most popular deconcentration policy option is school choice, which has been extensively studied by social scientists. Unfortunately, results on whether choice is an effective desegregation policy have been mixed. However, this is not all that surprising, since school choice is not one thing but many different things, the efficacy of which will depend on the specifics of the program and the context within which it is implemented (Schwartz and Stiefel, 2014).====The second most popular deconcentration policy option is to open up affordable housing opportunities for minority families within high performing/high income school attendance zones (SAZs).==== This option is based on the belief that minorities are trapped in poor schools because their families cannot afford the housing found within non-poor SAZs (Rothwell, 2012). Proponents of this option point out that improving housing affordability within non-poor SAZs would improve not only the school environment of minority students but also their neighborhood environment, which considerable research has shown has its own positive impact on the child's development (Ellen and Turner, 1997). There are, however, a number of reasons why more affordable units within non-poor SAZs may not guarantee the deconcentration of minorities within poor schools. First, minority families may be disinterested in these units. Concerns other than improving their child's school environment may dominate their locational choice, such as access to public transit, job opportunities, or social services. Second, the parents or guardians of minority children may be concerned that their child would be uncomfortable in what would be in most cases a majority white school. Third, even if minorities are willing to locate within a non-poor SAZ, they may be excluded from these SAZs by discrimination on the part of housing suppliers.==== In comparison to school choice, there is little, if any, empirical evidence on the effectiveness of housing affordability as a deconcentration strategy. There is a simple reason for this. To study a possible causal factor empirically there must be variation in the factor that is related to the outcome of interest. Within higher income SAZs, anti-density zoning (and NIMBYism) have done a pretty successful job of eliminating affordable housing (Rothwell, 2012).====In this paper I exploit the recent volatility in Florida's local housing markets to investigate the housing affordability option as a strategy for deconcentrating black and Hispanic elementary school students within poor, low performing schools. Florida's unprecedented boom/bust housing cycles have varied in their timing and intensity across its school districts, which in Florida are county-wide. Most importantly for the purpose of this study, as documented below, the proportion of a district's affordable units found in better SAZs plummeted during the booms but rose after the crashes. In essence, Florida provides a natural experiment for investigating what might happen to school integration if more affordable housing was available within SAZs containing higher quality schools.====My empirical methodology involves relating increases in the proportion of a school district's affordable housing units located in SAZs containing better schools to the proportion of a district's black and Hispanic students attending poor schools. The key question to be addressed is whether the families of minority students move to better school zones when the opportunity presents itself. While an answer in the affirmative may seem obvious, as noted above there are factors that may prevent this from happening. Moreover, as I review below, there is evidence from previous studies that throws into question the willingness of poor families, who are predominantly minorities, to take advantage of opportunities that seemingly would better their lives.====Better schools are defined based on three separate criteria — a low percentage of students receiving a free lunch, a high percentage of students passing a standardized exam, and the school receiving a high letter grade from the Florida Department of Education. Because affordable housing units are broken down into eight different types, I can not only test whether affordability has an impact on the proportion of a district's black and Hispanic students who attend bad schools, but I can also provide some evidence on which units matter most and I can do this separately for each racial group. For example, does an increase in affordable mobile home rentals within non-poor SAZs have the same or a different impact on the deconcentration of minorities attending bad schools than an increase in affordable single-family rentals? Identification of estimated effects comes from the use of a 15-year panel data set at the school district level employing alternative estimators, including linear fixed effects, pooled fractional probit, and two-stage least squares models.",The deconcentration of minority students attending bad schools: The role of housing affordability within school attendance zones containing good schools,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137718300718,March 2019,2019,Research Article,174.0

The quasi-natural experimental setting of a large-scale urban redevelopment project in Seoul, South Korea, announced in 2007 and cancelled six years later without any construction having taken place, allows us to cleanly disentangle the announcement affect from the actual development effect. Using more than 21,000 apartment transactions between 2006 and 2015, we find that the development announcement increases apartment prices between 2.4% and 7.3% for properties within 1 km radius of the project site. However, for buildings beyond 1 km, the effect becomes negative suggesting spatial redistribution of housing demand. The cancellation of the project leads to a significantly decline in prices between 3.5% and 5.2% for apartments within 1 km from the project site nearly cancelling the associated positive effects. We find that properties which are located around the project site but are not in direct proximity actually have a significant price cut after each announcement. Overall, we show that announcement and cancellation of development projects have a significant impact on residential property prices near the site but vary considerably in strength and direction across space.","Tiebout (1956) argues that facing an array of communities that offer different types and levels of public services and amenities, each individual household will move from one local community to another to maximise their utility. This process known as ""voting with their feet"" can explain the heterogeneity of house price levels among communities. Higher level of house prices in a certain community reflects better provision of public services and amenities in the community via higher willingness to pay for purchasing or renting a house by households. Starting with Oates (1969), a large number of empirical research tests the Tiebout theory and finds that the development of a new amenity has a significant impact on surrounding house prices. For example, amenities such as a new transit line or a sports stadium may have an overall positive impact on surrounding residential prices,==== whereas other facilitates, such as landfill, power plants or airports, may have a negative effect on the value of the surrounding residential properties.==== Some studies==== show that the overall effect from a development or an amenity (the development effect or the amenity effect) begins to be capitalised into property prices surrounding the development site as early as the first announcement of the development. This is due to the anticipation of future housing value growth after the completion of the development (McMillen & McDonald, 2004). Since property prices show this early response to news about developments, developers, government bodies and politicians need to be careful with this transmission mechanism to house prices as prices can be affected even without any construction taking place at all. What is the size of such purely announcement effects will be the focus of this paper.====While a number of studies has quantified effects associated with the announcement of new developments or amenities, such developments in deed take place and hence the anticipated house price increases are just capitalised somewhat earlier. We are interested in quantifying the effect on prices simply following an announcement of a new development and disentangling it from the actual development effect. This we call the announcement effect. However, assessing whether and to what degree the announcement effect exists is empirically challenging for various reasons. First, it is difficult to isolate the announcement effect from the effect of the actual development as those go hand in hand. As the development takes a long time, house prices can be influenced by incidental developments such as building a new road prior to the full completion of the amenity. House price changes can occur from the moment of announcement of the project throughout the whole construction phase and eventually event afterwards if the value of the project is over- or underestimated (McMillen & McDonald, 2004). Such price adjustments occur only gradually throughout the development process. Thus, it is not straight forward to define the cut-off point of when the announcement effect ends and the development effect takes over (that is, the announcement effect period, see Ahlfeldt and Kavetsos (2014) and Immergluck (2009)). This is even harder to identify for large-scale urban development projects, which may include multiple facilities and take dozens of years. Second, the announcement effect may vary in strength depending on the location of the properties in relation to the project site. We can observe spatial spillovers across property markets and spatial dependence in property prices following the announcement effect suggesting that some house price changes may not be associated with the announcement effects but rather with the spatial effects of house price changes.====In this paper, we quantify the announcement effect of an urban redevelopment project by using a quasi-natural experiment. We investigate the Yongsan International Business District (YIBD) project in Seoul, South Korea. What makes this project unique is that after it was officially announced in 2007 no further action and no construction has been taken and the development has been cancelled six years later. In August 2007, the Seoul metropolitan government announced for the first time the YIBD redevelopment. The main aim of the project was to turn a deprived downtown area of 515,483 m==== (356,000 m==== of which was a railroad maintenance depot and the rest, a residential area) into a global business district similar to the one in Roppongi Hills, Tokyo, and Canary Wharf, London. Totalling approximately $28.2 billion,==== the project was planned to develop commercial, retail, leisure and hotels. The announcement of the YIBD is enough to give rise to a constellation of the anticipation about future housing value growth near the project site. The project is to turn a huge land plot of dis-amenity facilities in the central urban area into amenity facilities. Most of the project site is a railway maintenance depot which is undesirable in an urban residential area due to noise and air pollution. The project would be expected to improve residential environment substantially by not only demolishing the dis-amenity facilities but also providing a number of aesthetic skyscrapers and consumption benefits from various facilities. Furthermore, after the official development announcement, the project labelled ‘the priciest real estate development project in the history of Korea====’ was frequently exposed to the public by mass media. In April 2013, the cancellation of the project was announced. Two factors are generally pointed out as primary causes of the project failure - the economic recession after the 2008 global financial crisis and the intense conflicts among the investors. During the 67-month period between the development announcement and the cancellation announcement, the project site consolidation had been conducted, however the construction of visible structures was not commenced.====We quantify the effect on house prices associated with two types of announcements – positive announcements of a new urban development and negative announcements of the cancellation of the development. We examine whether the announcement is capitalised into house prices by comparing transaction prices of properties surrounding the project site before and after the announcement. If the residential price changes are mainly driven by the anticipation of the development, then those should be offset with the cancellation of the project. A cancellation of the project is expected to result in an immediate and sharp price decline without any adjustment period. This can be compared to the effects from a collapse of a speculative housing bubble. Therefore, the bigger the announcement effect, the larger the negative impact of the cancellation would be on house prices. Assuming that the Seoul housing market is relatively efficient==== given the short-term inelastic supply of new housing, the capitalisation in house prices following the announcement effects would be substantially prominent and rapid (Gibbons and Machin, 2005, Glaeser et al., 2008, Mian and Sufi, 2009). Thus, we would not expect a significant net change in house prices after the two announcements.====We assume that the changes in property prices near the project site following the announcement would embed all positive and negative externalities expected by the development. Therefore, the announcement effects can be principally inferred from the spatial variation in the transaction prices of residential properties surrounding the development site after the announcements. For this purpose, we use a spatial difference-in-differences (DID) approach. A DID methodology essentially compares two samples of data – a treatment group and a control group – compared in two subperiods -before and after the announcement. The treatment group in our case consists of the apartment transactions in the ‘impact’ area, the area closest to the redevelopment site. The control sample comprises of the properties in the ‘control’ area, which is located further away from the project site where property prices are unlikely to be affected by the development. This quasi-experimental approach controls for the possible omission of significant variables correlated with the announcement effect (Ahlfeldt and Kavetsos, 2014, Gibbons and Machin, 2005, Pope and Pope, 2015). We apply the DID setting into a spatio-temporal autoregressive model (STAR), which we call the spatial DID model (SDID), rather than estimating a classic DID hedonic price model (HDID). The SDID looks at spatial dependence between transaction prices in the impact area and the control area. Thus, the SDID controls for the spatial autocorrelation effects across house prices which may not be directly related to the announcement.====We use apartment transaction data from the Ministry of Land of South Korea, covering all 21,200 apartment transactions in the area of interest between 2006 and 2015. The results provide strong evidence for the existence of significant announcement effects. Following the announcement of the redevelopment, apartment prices within 0.5 km from the project site increase by 7.3% relative to comparable apartments located 3–3.5 km away from the project site. However, for buildings further away from the site, the positive announcement effect has a negative effect on house prices suggesting spatial redistribution of housing demand. A cancellation of the project leads to a significantly decline in prices between 1.5% and 5.2% for apartments within 1.5 km from the project site. Those results suggest that both, positive and negative announcement effects of development projects have large impact on house prices and vary considerably in strength and direction across space.====The rest of this study is structured as follows.

This paper applies wavelet analysis to five first-tier cities in China to study housing price changes over time, to decompose housing prices into their trend and cycle components, and to explore co-movement and lead-lag relationships among these cities. We find the average cycle for all five cities to be 3.25 years, which is much shorter than the housing cycles observed in the United States. When we examine the cyclical lead-lag relationships among these cities, we find that during the 2008–2011 period, Shenzhen led Beijing, which led Guangzhou, which led Shanghai, and finally Tianjin followed. However, during the 2011–2014 period, the lead-lag relationships changed to Tianjin leading Shenzhen, then Shanghai, then Beijing, and finally Guangzhou. Although we generally observe a strong co-movement among the city pairs, the co-movement between Tianjin and each of the remaining four cities is weak. The weaker correlation between Tianjin and other cities indicates that real estate investors in these other four cities can improve their risk-return performance by adding Tianjin properties to their portfolios.","The primary objective of this paper is to improve our understanding of residential price dynamics and our ability to measure co-movement of prices across markets over time and frequencies. To achieve this objective, we apply wavelet technology to analyze housing markets in five major cities in the People's Republic of China.====In modern economies, housing comprises a large segment of aggregate demand, as well as a large segment of personal investment. Therefore, housing values play a critical role in the stability of national economies and financial markets. At the same time, housing price level is one of the most dynamic and unpredictable variables in the economy (Mu et al., 2009). The interaction of housing, financial and economic activities, and political interventions all contribute to nonlinearity and cyclical changes in housing values. Typically, housing prices exhibit oscillatory behaviors, with cycle periods ranging from a few years to a few decades (Wheaton, 1990). Both trend and cycle are often accompanied by random shocks that cannot easily be observed, and their adjustments are often distorted by exogenous shocks such as changes in government policy, or by the inelasticity of land supply.====Although there have been previous attempts to understand price dynamics in real estate markets, the methods used in previous studies suffer from a critical limitation. The usual time-domain approach utilized by earlier studies omits frequency horizons, or simply assumes time-invariant frequency in examining the temporal properties of a financial or economic variable.==== This approach does not convey any dynamic information regarding the frequency components of a variable. To overcome these problems, we utilize wavelet technology. Wavelet analysis captures both the frequency and the time variations of a time series. It thus captures the changing volatility of the price cycle by simultaneous treatment of the time-variant seasonal or frequency components along with the trend and cycle. It also facilitates a deeper understanding of co-movements in both short and long term horizons across asset types and markets.====In this study, we utilize wavelet technology to investigate both intra- and inter-regional dynamics of housing prices. We apply the analysis to examine price dynamics in the five first-tier cities in China: Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenzhen and Guangzhou. Using wavelet transform, we decompose regional prices into their trend and cycle components, and compare different patterns among cities. We further use a wavelets coherence test to analyze the co-movement and lead-lag relationships of the five regional prices over frequency (or scale) and time.====This paper makes two contributions to previous research on dynamics of housing prices. Firstly, it applies wavelet tools to analyze the duration of the housing price cycle and how such duration evolves over time. As far as we know, this is one of the first papers to apply wavelet technology to the study of housing price dynamics. This method helps us detect break points in price cycles (Bowden and Zhu, 2008). In addition, decomposing time series into different frequencies can provide considerable improvement over traditional techniques (Funashima, 2016).==== As a result, wavelet technology enables a deeper understanding of regional differences in the price formation process, including differences in cyclical activity, oscillatory amplitude, and variations in response to economic fundamental dynamics.====Secondly, we contribute to the literature on housing price dynamics by examining the degree of co-movement of housing prices in both time and frequency domains. Previous research on housing price dynamics assesses co-movement in the time domain by calculating the contemporaneous correlation coefficient or rolling window correlation coefficient, or, as a complementary, uses Fourier transform to measure the correlation between two series at each individual frequency (Rua, 2010). However, these methods consider the frequency and time components of the time series separately and require the data under investigation to be stationary or at least locally stationary. This is often not the case in real estate, since volatility in real estate markets is known to exhibit complicated patterns like jumps, clustering and long memory. The wavelet tools enable us to assess the evolution of co-movement strength and direction in housing prices and lead-lag relationships for different housing market pairs. Such analysis will clearly provide essential insights for policymakers and investors with differing investment horizons.====We find the average cycle for all five cities to be 3.25 years, which is much shorter than in the United States where long cycles are around 15–20 years and short cycles are around 5 years. The length of each cycle in the five Chinese cities, though similar, is slightly different, ranging from an average of 3.3 years in Shenzhen to 3.0 years in Tianjin. When we examine the cyclical lead-lag relationships among these cities, we find that during the 2008–2011 period, Shenzhen led Beijing, which led Guangzhou, which led Shanghai, and finally Tianjin followed. However, during the 2011–2014 period, the lead-lag relationships changed to Tianjin leading Shenzhen, then Shanghai, then Beijing, and finally Guangzhou. We observe a strong co-movement among the city pairs of Beijing–Shanghai, Beijing–Guangzhou, Beijing–Shenzhen, Shanghai–Guangzhou, Shanghai–Shenzhen and Guangzhou–Shenzhen, with the co–movement being stronger in the long term. In contrast, the co–movement between Tianjin and each of the remaining four cities is weak. Our finding that Tianjin exhibits weaker correlation with the other cities indicates that real estate investors in any of the other four cities may improve their risk-return performance by adding Tianjin properties to their portfolios.====The structure of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we present a review of previous dynamic housing price studies and regional market price studies. In Section 3, we present an institutional background on the five cities studied. In Section 4, we present the technology of wavelet decomposition and coherency analysis. In Section 5, we discuss the data. In Section 6, we present the empirical findings.

Our study is novel in a number of key ways. First, new insights are obtained through utilising a large disaggregated panel dataset comprising multiple types of housing (detached, semi-detached, terraced housing and flats) for a very large sample of 348 England and Wales local authorities. Second, we analyse through probit estimation those factors that drive convergence club formation. Third, we also consider within-city club formation as well as club formation during periods of house price bubbles. Using a study period of more than two decades, we find the presence of divergence or multiple house price convergence clubs rather than a single club. While location, distance, income, population density, congestion and education are significant in explaining convergence club formation, housing type is also an important factor with convergence less likely among detached, semi-detached and terraced housing than among flats.","There is considerable value in understanding how relative regional house prices behave over time. Not only do they have the potential to influence relative regional economic activity, but also the affordability of housing, relocation costs and labour mobility between regions. While there is a relatively extensive literature that explores inter-regional house price convergence, there have been far fewer studies that explore intra-regional convergence. Indeed, little is known about the causes explaining the evolution of intra-regional house prices and the increased disparities within regions. This is because tradition has been to employ standard definitions of economic regions to study spatial differences in house prices by authors such as Meen (2002), Clark and Coggin (2009), and Fadiga and Wang (2009). One might consider the notion of convergence clubs that are based on the clustering of house price series according to some common factor such that there is movement over time leading towards a steady state. With this in mind, Kim and Rous (2012) note that the possibility of house price convergence club classifications that are not entirely compatible with any of the widely used definitions of economic regions has implications for the rationale behind including regional dummy variables. Moreover, estimated coefficients may not be capturing the full effect of important geographically-based omitted variables.====In this paper, we examine the evidence for convergence clustering across England and Wales local authorities, on the basis of house price trends over the period 1995–2017. Given that we employ data from 348 authorities for four types of property for more than two decades, this is one of the largest datasets employed in the house price convergence literature; for a recent review see Meen (2016). It is of interest to investigate the characteristics of convergent and divergent subgroups as well as possible factors driving the convergence clubs. With this in mind, we also explore whether the formation of convergence clubs is based on common factors among groups of local authorities leading them to converge to a similar house price level. A small number of studies have examined regional house price convergence using the club convergence and clustering procedure of Phillips, Sul, 2007, Phillips, Sul, 2009. For example, Montagnoli and Nagayasu (2015) find that house prices across UK regions can be grouped into four clusters, confirming the heterogeneity and complexity of the UK housing market. They document the dynamics of house price spillovers across regions. There are stronger spillover effects from the core regions such as London, but regional economic and financial developments are found to be important too. In the case of US states, Kim and Rous (2012) find strong evidence of multiple convergence clubs. They also examine the general characteristics of the various convergence and divergence subgroups as well as some important driving forces of convergence clubs. They find that housing supply regulation together with climate are important determinants of convergence club membership. Apergis et al. (2015) analyse the long run behaviour of provincial house prices in South Africa across nine provinces. In doing so, they consider three segments of the housing market and find that the nine provinces do not form a homogeneous convergence club. Data limitations prevent a formal analysis of the drivers behind convergence club formation. Blanco et al. (2016) identify convergence clubs in house prices among Spanish regions and find that regional house prices do not converge to a common trend and so confirms the existence of segmentation in the Spanish housing market. Spanish regions are found to be grouped across four separate convergence clubs. The estimation of an ordered logit model suggests that differences in population growth, size of the rental market, initial house supply and geographical situation have played significant roles in determining club membership.====Another strand of the literature focuses more on the interaction of the housing market with macroeconomic variables. Kuttner and Shim (2016) gauge the effectiveness of non-interest rate policies on house prices whereas Plakandaras et al. (2017) discuss the effects of macroeconomic shocks on house prices for the US and the UK. Jordà et al. (2015) examine the interdependence between monetary policy and house prices. The earlier literature on the interaction between the macro economy and the housing market is reviewed in Goodhart and Hofmann (2007).====Whether or not local authority house prices drift apart, there are implications for relative affordability, labour mobility, labour mismatch, commuter times and potential localised house price bubbles. Essentially, these are issues relating to economics, financial stability and well-being. Our investigation differs from the above-mentioned studies in a number of key ways. First, we examine house price convergence clubs from an intra-regional perspective using a very large data set for 348 England and Wales local authorities. This is in sharp contrast to existing studies of inter-regional convergence that employ a far more limited number of time series based on aggregated regions. While existing studies of convergence club formation in house prices such as Kim and Rous (2012) and Tsai (2018) make a valuable contribution to our understanding of regional housing market interaction, they are based on more aggregated regional data. However, this extent of regional aggregation employed can mask insights in terms of what is going within the standard regional classifications in terms of convergence club formation and the drivers of club formation. Second, we take the extent of disaggregation further still through a breakdown of property types. In contrast to existing studies that provide insights into interregional convergence based on a single house price measure encompassing all property types, we distinguish between four property types. This enables us to investigate the extent to which convergence club formation is influenced by property type in addition to other drivers of convergence. Third, we offer an analysis of convergence club formation within cities. Studies by Jones and Leishman (2006), Liu et al. (2016), Oikarinen et al. (2018) and others point to the presence of heterogeneity of house price dynamics within cities. With our focus on local authorities across England and Wales, we also reflect on whether house price dynamics around convergence club formation within London paint a different picture compared to the rest of our sample.====We are therefore able to incorporate a significantly greater degree of heterogeneity in the UK housing market in our assessment of convergence.==== It is well-known that districts within a given region can themselves be subject to great variation in terms of the house price behaviour and the local drivers that influence housing demand. Also, it may well be that housing type is at least as an important consideration as the distance between local authorities when it comes to assessing the extent of convergence club formation. Indeed, convergence club formation may well be more associated with certain types of housing than others. Indeed, heterogeneity in the housing market is important (see also Nemov et al., 2016). These are key issues that our study explores by employing a disaggregated dataset. Given that housing affordability has been a key concern, borough price convergence or divergence across housing types is of potential interest to policy-makers with an eye on long-term affordability. The potential policy implications that arise from this are in terms of measures such as transport policy to address commuting issues, house building to address affordability, incentives for employment to be offered in cheaper areas and financial measures to address potential bubbles.====The rest of the paper is structured as follows. The following section provides a review of the Phillips and Sul convergence club methodology. The third section describes the data set that we employ. Our data set is far more detailed than hitherto applied in convergence club studies. The fourth section reports and discusses our results. Based on 1386 time series, we find evidence in support of four convergence clubs for England and Wales house prices. In the fifth section, we analyse the drivers in terms of what determines convergence club membership.

Using land supply as an instrument, we find that city-level housing price has a positive effect on co-residence, and this effect is larger for those who do not own a house, who have a lower level of ====, and who are relatively younger. Husband's parents, who take relatively more responsibility to provide housing support for the young couple, are more likely to be co-resided with.","Since China started the market-oriented housing reform in the 1990s, it has gradually become a country with one of the highest rates of home ownership in the world (Gan et al., 2013). Meanwhile, housing price in China has demonstrated a long-term increasing trend. In the past three decades, the rising housing price not only had important implications on macro economy and social inequality, but also deeply affected various household behaviors, such as saving (Wang and Wen, 2011), occupational choice (Wang, 2012, Li and Wu, 2014), labor force participation (Fu et al., 2016), and marriage (Wei et al., 2017). This paper extends the scope of studies on the consequences of rising housing price by linking it with another important family behavior – intergenerational co-residence between the elderly parents and adult children.====Intergenerational co-residence is a common phenomenon in an agricultural society. Traditional theories suggest an inverse relation between household complexity and economic development. Intergenerational co-residence usually diminishes with industrialization, migration, and economic growth (Ruggles and Heggeness, 2008). For example, around 74% elderly people are living with a child or a grandchild in Africa and Asia, whereas this number is only 19% in North America (United Nations, 2005). Goode (1963) predicts that the nuclear family will eventually predominate worldwide. However, intergenerational co-residence has become popular in recent years in many developing countries despite their fast economic growth. Ruggles and Heggeness (2008) show that the share of younger generation people who co-reside with their parents increased during the period of 1970–2000 in 10 out of the 15 developing countries in their sample. They propose that demographic changes, such as the reduction in fertility and mortality rates, tend to favor intergenerational co-residence. For China, the shrink of family size due to the One-Child Policy and the large scale migration are, of course, with great importance.====In addition to the demographic analysis, the existing literature has examined various economic factors that affect intergenerational co-residence, and more generally, living arrangement or household formation. Such economic factors include employment status (Lee and Painter, 2013, Engelhardt et al., 2016), income of the youth and the elderly (Haurin et al., 1993, Takagi and Silverstein, 2011, Costa, 1999, Crimmins and Ingegneri, 1990, Whittington and Peters, 1996), housing cost (Winkler, 1992, Haurin et al., 1993, Ermisch and Salvo, 1997). In particular, Ermisch (1999) proposes a model that links young people's decision to live apart from parents with housing prices. He uses British data to show that a higher regional housing price can retard home leaving of young people and encourage their returns to the parental home. Relatedly, Paciorek (2016) finds that higher housing costs depress housing demand and decrease the probability of living alone. Following this literature, we use several large-scale datasets to document the growing trend of intergenerational co-residence in urban China during the past three decades, and tries to establish a causal link between housing price and co-residence.====China adopted a far-reaching housing reform in the 1990s and had experienced a fundamental change in its urban housing market since then (Murray and Sun, 2017). Before the reform, residential houses were allocated mainly through the working unit. If employed, both the elderly parents and adult children would get their own living place. After a pilot experiment in several cities, the Chinese government started to sell public housing units to employees throughout the country in 1994. Urban housing was quickly commercialized (Chen, 1996, Lee, 2000), and the allocation of houses through the working unit was stopped in 1998. Since then, the real estate market has experienced a long-term boom.==== The average residential housing price in China has increased from around 756 RMB ==== per square meter in 1991 to 1790 ==== in 1997, 3576 ==== in 2008, and 7203 ==== in 2016.==== The growth rate is especially fast in big cities. For example, the residential housing price in Beijing increased from 4557 ==== per square meter in 2000 to 17151 ==== in 2010, which corresponds to a nominal growth rate of 14.2% per annum. In terms of the real growth rate, Fang et al. (2015) and Wu et al. (2012) both give a number that is above ten percent per annum for major Chinese cities during the period of 2003–2014. Because the growth rate of housing price generally exceeds that of household income, affordability has been a major concern. The mortgage market in China generally requires down payment to be at least 30 percent of the house value. For young adults who have not yet accumulated enough savings, it is difficult to purchase a house, and co-residing with their parents becomes a feasible way to lower living expenses. Thus, the higher housing price is a potential reason for an upward trend of intergenerational co-residence in urban China.====Apart from the incentive to save living cost, the wealth effect caused by housing capital gain could be another reason for the growing frequency of intergenerational co-residence. With the rising housing price, families who own a house have experienced a substantial wealth appreciation. On one hand, household complexity and economic development generally have a negative correlation (Ruggles and Heggeness, 2008). As a result, the likelihood of co-residence could be lower. On the other hand, a higher level of wealth also increases the demand for intergenerational care – including both care to the elderly parents provided by the adult children, and care to the grandchildren provided by the elderly parents (Wu and Li, 2014). For adults, as living together with the elderly parents offering a convenient way of providing old-age support and receiving child care at the same time, the chance of intergenerational co-residence may increase with the growth of their wealth.====In this paper, we first present some graphical evidence on the time-series and cross-sectional variation of intergenerational co-residence. For this purpose, we use a long panel dataset, the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS), to document a growing trend of co-residence during 1991–2011. Then we use a large cross-sectional dataset, the 2005 Inter-Census Population Survey, to demonstrate the positive correlation between housing price and living arrangement in major Chinese cities.====In the regression analysis, we use a nationally representative panel dataset, the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS), to estimate an individual fixed-effect model. Co-residence is largely a joint decision of the elderly parents and their adult children in China. If viewed separately, elderly parents’ moving in decision is often affected by health shocks, while the decision of young adults would be more affected by housing price (Lee and Painter, 2009, Paciorek, 2016). In order to examine the impact of housing price, we focus on the young adults’ decision. Adults who choose to co-reside with parents include both those who do not leave their parent home after starting to work and those who return to their parental home after living separately for a while. To deal with the endogeneity of housing price, we use local land supply as an instrumental variable. With the control of various individual characteristics (including age, income, education, development level, and income distribution), our regression results confirm that housing price has a positive effect on the probability that an adult child lives with the elderly parents. We also examine the role of home ownership and household wealth in determining the co-residence behavior.====With the world-wide trend of population aging, old-age support and health care have become a major concern for both economists and policy makers. In this regard, living arrangement of the elderly has enormous importance (Engelhardt and Greenhalgh-Stanley, 2010). Previous studies on intergenerational co-residence in China mostly look at its consequences on elderly well-being, paying particular attention to the rural area where many young people migrate. For example, Ren and Treiman (2015) find that elderly parents living with children are less happy than those who live independently, but the negative effects disappear when there are grandchildren in the household. Lei et al. (2015) demonstrate that the elderly's living alone is accompanied with being living close to children. In addition to the implications in terms of healthy aging, living arrangement also has a huge impact on macroeconomic outcomes such as consumption and labor force participation of the young generation (Pezzin and Schone, 1999, Kochar, 2000, Sasaki, 2002). Recently, Rosenzweig and Zhang (2014) point out that intergenerational co-residence masks the true life-cycle pattern of saving rate for Chinese households, and it is necessary to take co-residence into account in order to understand the so-called “Chinese saving puzzle.” While Yi et al. (2018) study a similar topic as our paper, there are significant differences between these two papers in terms of data, empirical method, mechanism, and major findings.====The remaining of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 displays some stylized facts of intergenerational co-residence and discusses why housing price matters. Section 3 introduces the empirical strategy and gives detailed data description. Section 4 reports the empirical results.

Findings suggest that appreciation patterns of low-income neighborhoods are different than those of high-income neighborhoods. Moreover, appreciation of housing prices in low-income neighborhoods that have experienced gentrification is different than in other low-income neighborhoods not gentrified. To analyze this issue further, we compare the behavior of housing prices in neighborhoods experiencing different stages of gentrification with housing prices in low-income neighborhoods that have not been gentrified. Housing price appreciation is only observed in neighborhoods gentrified that had low levels of income when gentrification was measured. One interpretation of these findings is that housing prices appreciate in neighborhoods experiencing early stages of gentrification, but not in neighborhoods that have been gentrified for longer periods of time. These results could suggest that gentrification may cause displacement pressures in the early stages, but prices are stabilized in neighborhoods being gentrified for some time, reducing the probability of displacement of the low-income population.","Many large American cities have recently undergone urban renewal processes better known as gentrification, urban revitalization, or neighborhood renewal processes. Urban renewal refers to housing renovation followed by the process of resettlement of the upper middle class into low-income city neighborhoods (Clay, 1979). Gentrification, on the contrary, has several definitions. For instance, Hyra (2008) refers to gentrification as the “new urban renewal,” but it has also been defined in the literature as the process in which urban low-income neighborhoods experience socioeconomic upgrading (Ding et al., 2016), influx of affluent households (Martin and Beck, 2016), housing renovation (Helms, 2003) and appreciation of housing prices (Rosenthal and Ross, 2015), among others. In this paper, gentrification is understood as a change observed in central, low-income neighborhoods that experienced housing renovation and an influx of middle- and high-income households.====The consequences of gentrification have been widely explored in the literature. Although some authors suggest that low-income populations are not displaced from these neighborhoods (see Freeman, 2009, McKinnish et al., 2010, Ding et al., 2016, Ellen and O'Regan, 2011, Martin and Beck, 2016), others note that gentrification increases income disparities and racial segregation in the inner cities as a result of the influx of middle- and high-income populations into gentrified neighborhoods (Walks and Maaranen, 2008, Lees, 2008, Nyden et al., 2006, Palen and London, 1984).====The socioeconomic effects of urban renewal processes have been analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. Joseph and Chaskin (2010) conduct surveys in gentrifying neighborhoods in Chicago to analyze the perception of the gentrified and the gentrifying population in terms of displacement, quality of life and social relations. DeVerteuil (2011) performs a similar exercise in some gentrified neighborhoods of London and Los Angeles by analyzing the displacement of social services facilities as a proxy of displacement of the population. Recent quantitative analyses that focus on the causes of gentrification, its consequences, and the study of mixed-income communities include studies by Freeman, 2005, Freeman, 2009), McKinnish et al., 2010, Brueckner and Rosenthal, 2009, Bostic and Martin, 2003, and Atkinson (2003) among others. Epple and Sieg, 1999, Galster, 2007, Galster and Booza, 2007 and McKinnish and White (2011) have investigated the existence and stability of mixed-income neighborhoods in central locations using theoretical models of population sorting, finding an optimal combination of economic efficiency and distributive equity, calculating entropy indexes to define bipolar neighborhoods, and analyzing characteristics of incomers to heterogeneous neighborhoods.====Although the socioeconomic consequences of gentrified neighborhoods have been reported in the literature, the effect of gentrification on housing price appreciation is barely known. Housing price appreciation has been included in the gentrification definition to study the effect on displacement of the low-income population (Martin and Beck, 2016), but not as a consequence of the process. Guerrieri et al. (2013) study the housing price appreciation of neighborhoods after a citywide exogenous housing price boom. Thereafter, defining gentrification as those neighborhoods where low-income population is displaced by more affluent new residents due to the exogenous shock, the authors explore how prices rise after poor residents leave.====The present paper aims to fill this gap by analyzing housing appreciation patterns of neighborhoods experiencing gentrification during the decade of the 1990s. Gentrified neighborhoods in this paper are defined as those low-income city central communities that experienced an increase in building permits and an influx of households with a family income greater than the median of the city. Specifically, this paper compares appreciation patterns in the city of Chicago with specific patterns in low-income neighborhoods. Then, the comparison is made between two sets of low-income neighborhoods, those that experienced gentrification during the 1990s, and those not gentrified. Since appreciation is different for those neighborhoods experiencing gentrification, we finally estimate directly the behavior of housing prices in neighborhoods gentrified during the 1990s that had different levels of income and housing prices at the beginning of the decade.====Chicago has been an interesting case study in the gentrification literature because of the frequent and widespread relocations that have occurred in past decades, and the attempts made by the city to implement several programs to reduce segregation in neighborhoods (Lin, 2002, Nyden et al., 2006, Helms, 2003; and Betancur, 2002). The Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (DHUD) have attempted to reduce the level of housing segregation in the city by creating mixed-income housing development programs such as the Gatreaux program, the HOPE VI housing redevelopment program, the Lake Park Place program, and the Plan for Transformation (for details, see Joseph and Chaskin, 2010, Wyly and Hammel, 2000; and von Hoffman, 1996). If gentrification processes can appreciate housing prices of low-income neighborhoods without producing displacement (a general finding in the literature; see McKinnish and White, 2011, Ellen and O'Regan, 2011, Martin and Beck, 2016, Ding et al., 2016, Vigdor, 2010, Freeman, 2005, McKinnish et al., 2010, Newman and Wyly, 2006), the gentrification phenomenon could be seen as a successful market-driven alternative to create income mixing and reduce segregation in central city neighborhoods. However, negative consequences such as social exclusion and cultural and political displacement should also be considered when analyzing the effects of gentrification.====According to the results, patterns of housing price appreciation are different for low- and high-income neighborhoods. In general, neighborhood characteristics have a similar impact on housing prices before and after observing gentrifying forces. However, the effect of neighborhood characteristics changes for low-income neighborhoods, specifically, for those neighborhoods gentrified in the period analyzed. When analyzing the direct impact of gentrification on housing prices, results suggest that gentrification does not appreciate house prices on average, but this appreciation is positive and significant for properties located in neighborhoods with a low level of income and/or mid-level of housing prices at the beginning of 1990s. One interpretation of these results is that appreciation of housing prices is only observed in those neighborhoods experiencing early stages of gentrification (when income and housing prices are still low), but not in neighborhoods that have been gentrified for longer periods of time. In terms of policy implications, these results could suggest that gentrification may cause displacement pressures in the early stages, but prices are stabilized in neighborhoods being gentrified for some time, reducing the probability of displacement of the low-income population. Housing price appreciation due to gentrification is beneficial if mixed-income communities are created when low-income population is not displaced due to a rise in property taxes (a result found by Martin and Beck, 2016; and McKinnish and White, 2011), and when the influx of mid- and high- income households is greater than the displacement effect. Since gentrification is not a uniform phenomenon, it should be studied with caution to understand its possible benefits and disadvantages.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section defines gentrification and describes the data used for the empirical model. Section 3 explores different housing price appreciation patterns and describes the identification strategy to estimate the effect of gentrification on housing prices.

In this study, we aimed to analyze how the young-elderly in the Montreal metropolitan area deal with the duality opposing a dwelling's characteristics with those of the neighborhood in their residential choices. Therefore, those who move need to make choices within the constraints of both dwelling and neighborhood characteristics. We employed a statistical approach combining both dwelling and neighborhood characteristics from the 2011 National Household Survey (2011 NHS) and geospatial data, first in separate models and then in a joint model. Our results revealed that the general characteristics of an ideal home of retirees are 3 to 4 rooms, a high-rise building, and a low-density neighborhood. We noted that the geographical location of the previous dwelling is an important determinant of the geographical location of the new one, suggesting a strong territorial attachment among the young-elderly. By stratifying the model with the income quintile, we noted that choices varied widely according to the socioeconomic profile. Thus, for the lower-class of young-elderly, housing costs are a predominant factor, while condos are the preferred housing tenure of the upper class, who also sought to live in a wealthy neighborhood. This segregation dynamic may lead to territorial segmentation, where the upper class seeks to live apart from the rest of the population.","In past decades, most studies on residential location were concerned with families, which formed a large part of the population in the Western world during the second half of the XXth century (Karsten, 2007, Michielin and Mulder, 2008, Turcotte and Vézina, 2010). Thus, a large part of the housing market has been customized for their needs. As with most developed societies, Canada faces important demographic changes. The increase in life expectancy and low fertility levels recorded in the last 40 years suggest an important increase in the proportion of young-elderly people (Girard et al., 2013). Population aging is especially important in the province of Quebec, because the Baby Boom of the 50s was most prevalent here. As this cohort approaches the retirement age, the Baby Boom generation is likely to change to a Papy Boom generation in the coming years.====According to the life cycle theory, the different cycles of life, such as marriage, childbirth, divorce, departure of children, or the death of a partner, determine needs in housing and residential location (Æro, 2006, Kim et al., 2005, Landale and Guest, 1985, Michielin and Mulder, 2008, Rossi, 1955, South and Crowder, 1997, Speare et al., 1975). A change in this cycle can lead to the dissatisfaction of the current housing scheme and indicate the need for a change. Retirement brings an important change in a person's life and affects the needs in housing, as commuting is no longer an issue and also because this event is often concomitant with the departure of children. Although empirical studies show that the odds of moving around the age of 65 are moderate (Marois and Bélanger, 2014, Marois et al., 2018), the number of movers is likely to grow following the increase in the size of the cohort reaching the retirement age. The study of the residential choices of the elderly is therefore important in social sciences and for urban planning (De Jong and Brouwer, 2012, Kim, 2011).====This paper studies the residential choices of retirees in the Montreal metropolitan region (Canada). More specifically, we aim to analyze how the young-elderly deal with the duality opposing a dwelling's characteristics and those of a neighborhood in their residential choices, as movers need to make choices within the constraints of both dwelling and neighborhood characteristics. For this purpose, we employ a statistical approach by performing mixed logit regressions on movers aged 65–74 years old, using dwelling and neighborhood characteristics from the 2011 National Household Survey (2011 NHS) and geospatial data, first in separate models and then in a joint model. Following the age-effect perspective of the life cycle theory, for policy concerns, we assume that the cohort succeeding the first Baby Boomers born between 1946 and 1955 will have similar preferences when they reach this age group. From a fundamental perspective, the present study is expected to bring new insights on mobility of aging population.

While automobile travel is necessary for this transition from the monocentric to the polycentric city, car travel alone, so this paper argues, is not sufficient. Instead, the decentralization of shops and jobs (two important “urban functions”) hinges on the initial spatial distribution of the urban electorate, as embodied by the original city’s shape (“urban form”). The electorate is more likely to tilt in favor of decentralization the less skewed is original city shape. Hence “function follows form”. Given that “form follows function” eventually, too, cities either remain centralized and skewed in the long run, or shed all three: central jobs, central shops, and skew. We turn to a sample of U.S. metropolitan areas to illustrate these ideas.","Ever since Victor Gruen opened ====, the first modern mall, in a Detroit suburb, thousands of shopping centers and office parks have sprung up in city peripheries (Lampugnani (1985); Garreau (1991); Hardwick (2010)). Decentralization of jobs and shops could be especially dramatic when highways were built around, or even through, cities (Baum-Snow, 2007a, Baum-Snow, 2007b, Glaeser and Kahn (2010)). At the same time, plans for such radial or tangential highways were often also shelved – witness the success of those grass roots movements against, say, Robert Moses’ plans for Lower Manhattan (Jacobs, Caro), the Spadina Expressway in Toronto, Covent Garden urban renewal in London or Berlin’s 1970s highway planning. Surely the city only paves the way for the decentralization of its employment and retail if a majority of its citizens approve.====This article will add: Support for, and opposition to, such decentralization are imprinted into – and hence may even be predicted by – the city’s shape. It is in this sense that function (jobs and shops) follows form (city shape), as in the paper’s title. Imagine a monocentric city inhabited by owner-occupiers voting on a proposal to transfer the city’s jobs and shops to a ring road encircling it. Surely we can predict these residents’ votes. Any resident living near the center (a resident we label centrist) will not want to give up on that center; the opposite is true for any resident living in the periphery (decentrist). A fine line, coincident with the ring halfway from the city’s center to its periphery, will divide those who are against decentralization from those who are for it. Even ahead of the vote we are able to assess centrists and decentrists, by counting their respective dwellings.====Ultimately city form drives the extent to which jobs and shops will decentralize. As city form changes over time or varies across cities, decentralization may stall, or accelerate, too. Fogelson (2003) devotes an entire chapter of his book on America’s “downtown” to “the specter of decentralization”. He writes that one “... phenomenon to which downtown businessmen and property owners attributed decentralization was residential dispersal” (p. 231). More homes at the urban fringe certainly mean more voters in favor of business decentralization. Similarly, Thurston and Yezer (1994) and Brueckner (2000) have discussed how “jobs follow people”, as opposed to how “people follow jobs”. Our discussion below will cast the interaction between “jobs and people” as one between “function and form”.====Of course cities are not solely, and not even predominantly, owner-occupied. Homeownership rates are typically not close to, and often fall well short of, one. Extracting decentralization’s urban political economy from urban form here is much less straightforward than for the simple owner-occupied city. Further, note that the bulk of the urban literature – the very literature this paper wants to connect to – departs from a landlord-tenant, rather than an owner-occupier, setup (see the “absentee landlords” in Brueckner (1987) or Helsley (2004), or the “common ownership” framework in Wheaton (1973) and Borck and Brueckner (2018)). For these reasons we will pursue our analysis of centrists’ and decentrists’ strengths within a more general resident-landlords-cum-tenants framework.====So suppose each landlord owns multiple – two! – properties: one property to live in, the other to rent out. We rarely observe a landlord’s full set of properties. We cannot determine that set’s average location. We do not know whether a given landlord is a centrist or not. However, we often observe the distribution of population (or housing) across the city’s rings, as one representation of urban form. This “city shape” places constraints on the smallest number of centrists that could conceivably nest into it. Consulting suitable subsets of city rings, different lower bounds on centrists will emerge. We may estimate centrists’ true (unknown) number by employing the largest of those.====Besides recurring on observable city shape (i.e. aggregate) data only, the largest of our lower bounds (or the “greatest cumulative ring difference”, as it is also referred to below) has four remarkable properties. First, it is representable by a formula (and a simple one at that). It may easily be fed shape data from any city presented to it. Second, it will never overestimate centrists’ true number. It provides us with conservative estimates of true centrists. Nor will it, third, underestimate centrists’ true number by “too much”. It provides us with efficient (i.e. not unnecessarily small) estimates. And fourth, it will be bounded by city shape’s skew. Ultimately we may hope to learn about the city’s politics simply by inspecting its shape. E.g., we will see that if that shape “leans more towards” the city center, voters are more inclined to maintain – “lean more towards” – that center.====Urban form is an interesting field in its own right, as forcefully argued in Lynch (1960) and Baranow (1980). This paper adds that urban morphology, as the study of city form, has uses that go beyond the descriptive. Besides, reading restrictions on a city’s various political interests off its physical form also complements a prominent view due to Louis Sullivan. According to Sullivan (1896), “... it is the pervading law of all things organic and inorganic, ... that the life is recognizable in its expression”. Among architectural theorists, Sullivan’s view has become the proverbial ====. This paper provides a framework of how instead building contours (form) determine buildings’ uses (function), or of how ... ====.====Much as a city’s shape previews the minimum share of its centrists does it preview its minimum share of decentrists. We will see that decentrists’ minimum share coincides with (minus) the least cumulative ring difference. Important factions of urban political economy now become estimable by inspecting city shape (Proposition 1). We are also interested in understanding the effects of varying that shape. First we will show that more compact cities exhibit more centrists, less decentrists (Proposition 2); and that cities whose shape is skewed more to the right (left) exhibit more centrists (decentrists) (Proposition 3). If skew is positive (negative) enough then a majority holding on to the traditional center (pushing for decentralization) is inevitable, whatever the assignment of landlords and tenants in the city at hand. Skew literally reveals urban form’s hidden grip on local politics. And, one concept that is graphic predicts another that is political.====We then decompose shape into topography and building height, and discuss the extent to which these “shape shifters” affect urban political economy (Proposition 4). We will suggest that tighter natural constraints on developable land impede decentralization. In that sense, New York is compact because its geography discourages (political support for) the decentralization of its business and shopping. Alternatively, cities able to expand in any direction, such as Houston or Atlanta, have shapes that are skewed less. Here a majority of voters push for decentralization. We will add that tighter limits on building height risk the CBD’s demise, as argued previously by Glaeser and Kahn (2010). Tighter constraints on building height are asymmetric by nature. They tend to weaken centrists and strengthen decentrists.====As time progresses, function and form interact. Political decisions on where to locate jobs and shops not just ==== urban form (function follows form), but of course also ==== it (form follows function). We will address this mutual interaction. Cities that have many centrists and few decentrists initially will not take decisions that weaken the CBD. In contrast, cities that start out with many decentrists and few centrists to begin with are more likely to embrace decentralization. Decentralization subsequently reverses the structure of rents, which has suburban buildings grow in number and height. This in turn reinforces the number of decentrists, and eventually locks city functions into their ultimate ring road position. Two very different equilibria coexist, and either may actually emerge, depending on the city’s original shape (Proposition 5).====U.S. Census Bureau provides detailed data on population as well as population-weighted densities by distance (in miles) from the city center, for all U.S. metropolitan areas. These data have been collected for years 2000 and 2010, with respect to identical geographies (Wilson (2012)). “Population by distance from the center” coincides precisely with this paper’s idea of city shape, and so these data are uniquely suited to illustrate aspects of our theory below. For each metropolitan area we avail of the full distribution of the urban population across the city’s rings. We briefly preview these shape data on two specific cities, to give a flavor of the path dependence that both (i) is suggested by our theory and (ii) may be consistent with our sample (Fig. (1)).====San Diego, on the one hand, is coastal. From this paper’s perspective, this is why its shape not just is noticeably skewed to the right to begin with (diag. (a)). It also barely changes over the decade that follows (diag. (c)). Small relative losses (red on screen in diag. (a)) are balanced by small relative gains (not shown in (a) but shown in (c)) in both, central and peripheral, rings. Phoenix, on the other hand, is continental and barely land-constrained. And so its shape is much less skewed already back in 2000 (diag. (b)). Our theory has us expect that the mass of its population shifts out over the ten following years, and that is precisely what it does (diag. (d)). Larger relative losses (in red in diag. (b)) impose in, yet are also restricted to, central rings, while larger relative gains (not shown in (b) but shown in (d)) occur in peripheral rings only.====The paper has seven sections. Section 2 sets out city shape as our notion of urban form and reviews the urban political economy of decentralization in an owner-occupier setting. Section 3 shifts to a landlord-tenant setup, and shows how to extract minimum shares of centrists and decentrists from city shape even then. These shares are new to the literature (if we except a companion paper with an independent, linear programming, approach, cf. (Dascher, 2018)). Section 4 decomposes shape into topography and building height. Section 5 lets shape adjust, too. In the long run, shops and jobs either cluster in the traditional center, with residents staying around, or relocate to the periphery, with residents following suit. Section 6 offers some evidence with respect to the model’s key predictions. Section 7 concludes.",Function Follows Form,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137717302759,18 August 2018,2018,Research Article,181.0

Since the influential paper by Gyourko et al. (2013), superstar cities have drawn increasing attention.==== One key feature of these markets is that strong demand worsens affordability conditions and crowds out low-income families. To address this problem in superstar cities, governments across the world have adopted various policies, but little has been learnt about the true effects of their policy interventions. In this paper, we study the impacts of ten rounds of cooling measures during a recent housing market boom in Singapore.====Housing is an incredibly important asset in Singapore, not least because just over 90% of all households own their units. Home equity is 40% of household sector net worth in Singapore, which is far greater than the analogous share of 14% in the United States.==== The residential building sector comprises a significant share of overall economic activity, too. Expenditures on ‘Residential Buildings’ comprised 28% of all gross fixed capital formation in Singapore for 2015, and amounted to just over 7% of GDP. Additionally, governments around the world have a strong interest in their housing markets for social reasons, too. Housing is the locus of where people spatially organize their personal and professional lives. Distributional issues often are relevant in the sense that affordability conditions can be a central concern for policymakers (McMillen, 2008).====These factors often lead governments to intervene in their housing markets, and Singapore is no exception. This government is centrally involved in the property markets generally via sales of public land for private (and public) building. More recently, the government decided to respond to a large increase of 40%+ in its aggregate housing prices following the global financial crisis. In addition to potential financial stability worries raised by this sharp increase, affordability conditions deteriorated by about one-third between 2007 and 2010, as reflected in rising price-to-income ratios for those buying modest-sized HDB flats.====The Singaporean government decided to try to cool its housing market via a series of ten interventions that began in September 2009, with the last round implemented in December 2013. Housing prices in the public (HDB) and private sectors kept rising through the middle of 2013, around the time of the eighth specific policy announcement (each of which is described more fully in Section 3). Subsequently, prices fell by 10%−15% according to different price indices for the public and private sectors. Over this same time period, economic growth in Singapore has slowed, but statistical analyses we conducted to test for co-movement between housing price and economic fundamentals such as GDP and consumption do not show a tight link between changes in the series. This does not mean that real estate has no impact on the broader economy; it does; rather it indicates that Singapore's cooling measures have not generated any type of major collapse in the broader economy. Affordability conditions as we measure them in terms of price-to-income ratios for modest quality purchasers in the HDB sector have returned to pre-price jump levels.====These are beneficial outcomes, but caution remains in order regarding the magnitude of the overall success of the intervention. The drops in prices are relatively recent; they began in mid-2013 with stabilization occurring within the past year or so. There could be lagged responses in terms of households slowly adjusting consumption or firms altering their investment plans downward that our statistical tests based on currently available data are not powerful enough to pick up. Moreover, there are the standard economic concerns about inefficiencies generated from deadweight losses associated with each imposition of a tax as reflected in a new and different seller's stamp duty. Many were imposed throughout the long cooling process. Different policies were imposed roughly every six months, making it virtually impossible for us (or the government) to know what the impacts of any one intervention were. Such a strategy is bound to raise uncertainties for households, builders, and investors. That can generate its own efficiency losses in a complex durable goods market such as housing.====To evaluate the effects of the cooling measures in Singapore, we use micro-level house transaction datasets. We focus on Seller's Stamp Duty (SSD), Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty (ABSD), Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR), and the general loan-to-value (LTV) in Singapore in this study. We investigate the effects of policy changes in September 2009, February 2010, August 2010, January 2011, December 2011, October 2012, January 2013, June 2013, August 2013, and December 2013, respectively. We employ different identification strategies. To estimate the net effects of these policies on housing market, we apply the regression discontinuity method.====This paper is one of the first studies on the effectiveness of government intervention in property market and its implications to the general economy. As such, the empirical results provides important implications for the future policy design. Moreover, the use of large scale micro-level transaction data, together with the identification strategy design, enable us to obtain credible estimations of the policy effects.====The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. The next section provides an overview of Singapore's housing market and its role in the general economy. This is followed in Section 3 with a detailed description of Singapore's series of cooling efforts, along with two statistical tests of their effects.

Individuals choose which local public good to attend on the basis of income, and there are individuals in the same location but with different income that choose different public goods at different distances. Importantly, there is an equilibrium where smaller jurisdictions are comprised of a higher proportion of poor individuals.","The Mixed Income Housing model adopted by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) (2003) and other developed countries aims to change the orientation of urban space, essentially by dispersing very low-income residents throughout middle-income and low-to-middle-income residential areas, to alleviate some of the social problems associated with ghettoization. Like the public housing model, the Mixed Income Housing model is also project based, rather than tenant based like Section 8. Its goal is to mitigate the problems presented by the Section 8 program, where renters were ==== regulated to the poorest and most dangerous neighborhoods in the borough.====The presence and relevance of mixed-income areas in the United States (US) is remarkable. According to Tach (2010), in 2000, about 20% of census tracts were mixed-income. These tracts had substantial populations with both very low incomes (< 50% area median income) and high incomes (> 200% area median income).====Since the income of an individual is highly correlated with her education, health and employment opportunities, there is a role for public policy in implementing mixed-income communities. Several studies in the US and other developed countries indicate mixed-income models were an overall success.==== Benefits of mixed-income developments include addressing many problems associated with red-lining and ghettoization, such as the historic negative impact on education programs, as public education funding is tied to property tax income. Indeed, the impact of mixed income housing on education is theoretically a much more positive than commonly perceived outcome, since children of mixed income districts would have already grown used to a more diverse educational setting and therefore be better prepared to enter a more well-rounded discourse.====The goal of this paper is to understand how the Mixed Income Housing model may influence the way households living in mixed-income areas provide local public goods, either through political institutions – in the strict sense of a political jurisdiction – or in a more decentralized private manner (e.g., a private school financed by the contributions of its “ customers”). All that matters for our theory is that the consumption of the public good is subject to exclusivity (in the pure sense of the “ local public good” definition), i.e., only individuals belonging to the jurisdiction can make use of its public facility. Examples of local public goods are hospitals, schools, golf clubs, gyms, parks, community colleges, and child care centers.====The topic of jurisdiction formation with local public goods studies the problem that society faces when different individuals need to form coalitions (jurisdictions) in order to provide a mutually beneficial public good. In general, each individual has two different types of costs. One is common to all the members of the jurisdiction, and the other is specific to the individual. Alesina and Spolaore (1997), Casella (2001), Casella and Feinstein (2002), Bolton and Rolan (1997), Cremer et al. (1985), among others, emphasize the trade-off between size and heterogeneity in the provision of public goods (see Bolton et al., 1996 for a survey). Following this literature, our trade-off is the following. In a large jurisdiction, the cost to provide a local public good is split among more individuals and thus the poll fee is low compared to another public good with a smaller jurisdiction. However, a large jurisdiction implies a large average distance to the location of the local public good.====The consumers’ geographical distribution considered in this paper breaks the identification between the consumers’ preferences and their geographical location. Our specific spatial distribution allows us to dissect the properties of a dimensionally-constrained jurisdiction formation problem in a multidimensional context – heterogeneity in both geographical location and income (Epple and Platt, 1998 and Epple and Sieg, 1999, although in a very different context, also consider households heterogeneous in income and preferences).==== In this respect, our paper differs from Casella (2001) and Alesina and Spolaore (1997). The former looks at an excludable public good that enables private market transactions and, therefore, it is simpler to focus on consumers that differ in terms of geographical location but are otherwise homogeneous. The latter, on the other hand, focuses on sorting by preferences, and so it is natural that the geographical and the preference dimensions coincide. As Alesina and Spolaore propose in their conclusions, there is room for new insights by dropping this assumption, which seems unreasonable in many economic contexts (see also Alesina et al., 2004). The setup analyzed here is an hybrid of the two: a two dimensional (in income and geographical location) heterogenous mixed community that chooses on the level of congestion of its local public good.====In our model, residents are double-heterogeneous: they are not only uniformly distributed along the uni-dimensional interval (geographical - horizontal - facet of heterogeneity), but also there is a vertical facet of heterogeneity – namely, the resident’s wealth. This task is addressed here by assuming that individuals are uniformly distributed along the real line==== and that this distribution is “ fully mixed”, in the sense that every point in the geographical space is occupied by one and the same proportion of rich and poor residents. We think of this spatial set-up as having an affordable housing development in each location (we have a continuum of locations along the real line). In particular and for simplicity, we assume that half of residents are rich and pay market rents, while the other half are poor and live in affordable units. Thus, each location can be seen as a mixed-income community.====As in Casella (2001), our modeling assumptions borrow from Starret, 1974, Starret, 1988’s treatment of spatial clubs, exploiting the spatial representation to capture graphically the heterogeneity of preferences over the public good. Our notion of equilibrium consists of a system of intuitive conditions, such as the individuals’ distribution, the median voter condition, and a condition saying that an individual located at the jurisdiction frontier must be indifferent between two jurisdictions. Thus, our equilibrium concept relies on the notion of “Nash equilibrium in location” and departs from the literature on club formation that uses the notions of the “core” (Ellickson, 1979, Bewley, 1981, Scotchmer, Wooders, Scotchmer, Wooders, 1987 the memberships price-taking equilibrium (Ellickson, Grodal, Scotchmer, Zame, 1999, Luque, 2013, Faias, Luque, 2017). See Luque (2014) for a review of different approaches to prove equilibrium existence in models of club formation.====The main results of our model are the following. First, by considering a non-linear individual’s utility function we can show that there are equilibria where jurisdictions have ==== sizes and spatially overlap (i.e., there are residents in the same location but with different wealth that choose different public goods).==== It is in the border regions of these jurisdictions were we find such a phenomenon: rich residents choose the farther public good, while poor residents choose the nearer public good. Such equilibrium configuration exists in our model with heterogeneous individual types, but cannot exist when all individuals are of the same type (as in Casella, 2001).====Second, our model rationalizes the fact that the proportion of poor individuals varies across jurisdictions, and also that individuals do choose which public good to attend on the basis of their underlying income and residential location. Importantly, an individual’s location with respect to a public good location as well as the size and composition of the jurisdiction are endogenous.====A third result in this paper is that jurisdiction sizes matter for public policy because there is an equilibrium where local public goods in small jurisdictions serve a large percentage of poorer individuals. This result is also appealing to the empirical literature that uses distance-based Instrumental Variables (IVs) to predict choice of a public facility (see, for example, McClellan, McNeil, Newhouse, 1994, McClellan, 1995, McClellan, Newhouse, 1997 for the case of hospitals). Distance-based IVs must both predict choice of local public good and remain uncorrelated with outcomes (other than through public facility choice). However, in our model ==== is correlated with outcomes because the size of a catchment area is related to the underlying composition of individual types (see also Luque and Vanness, 2018 for a careful discussion of this result when applied to hospital choice).====Fourth, bringing heterogeneity in income within locations to the model is important because if individuals were to differ only by their geographical location, equilibrium must be characterized by the local public good being located in the middle of the jurisdiction interval, i.e., any impediment to locating the public good in the middle of the jurisdiction interval would preclude the existence of equilibrium. Unlike in Casella (2001), in our setting with double heterogeneity, the standard median voter condition on the public good location is no longer necessary to guarantee equilibrium existence.====So does the location of the public good matter in determining the jurisdiction frontiers? We answer in the affirmative. If the public good is not located in the middle of the jurisdiction (by a natural impediment, e.g., a mountain or a river, or because some historical reason), then any equilibrium jurisdiction structure must be characterized by different jurisdiction sizes, where rich and poor consumers in the jurisdiction face asymmetric frontiers. Such equilibrium configuration exists in our model, but not in the model with homogeneous consumers’ incomes. This clarifies that our results are indeed different from previous literature, and thus represent a further step in understanding the real world and urban configurations.====Our emphasis on public good location is related to the literature on “travelled-for public good” (see Berliant et al. (2006) for a model with a finite number of mobile consumers, Fujita (1986) for a classic model with a continuum of immobile consumers, and Peng and Wang (2005) for a model with endogenous number of visits to a “travel-for” local public good). Our model departs from this literature because we find equilibria where the jurisdictions that offer the same local public good are composed of heterogeneous consumers and this composition may vary, in size and proportions, across jurisdictions.====Our paper also departs from the literature that analyzes the trade-off between tastes for local public goods and local wages (see e.g., Berglas, 1976, McGuire, 1991, Gyourko, Mayer, Sinai, 2013,==== Luque, 2014, and Glaeser and Saiz 2004) in several respects, including our specific spatial setting along the real line and our focus on anonymous pricing of local public goods (poll taxes). Another important difference is that we assume that individuals already live in mixed-income communities and thus they inherit a location along the real line, so their only decision is to choose the jurisdiction to which they would like to belong to in order to consume a local public good. Our motivation, as explained above, is the Mixed Income Housing model adopted by the US HUD, where mixed-income communities are a result of a particular public housing policy and not a result of pure market forces. This location constraint also distances the model from those of Tiebout (1956) tradition - see, for instance, Ortalo-Magne and Rady (2008) and Luque (2013).====The rest of this paper is composed as follows. Section 2 briefly describes the main public policies used in the US to promote mixed-income areas. It also comments on the different definitions of a jurisdiction and provides some evidence of mixed-income areas in the US. Section 3 introduces the model and Section 4 presents the existence and characterization of equilibrium results. In Section 5 we depict examples to visualize the different equilibrium structures that our model can generate. Section 6 relates the model predictions with observed juridiction outcomes for the particular case when the local public goods are hospitals. Section 7 concludes and offers directions for future research.

This paper investigates whether housing unaffordability crowds out elites in Chinese superstar cities. Using both micro- and macro-level data from China's Urban Household Survey and China Statistical Yearbook for Regional Economy, we find that, in general, elites still prefer superstar cities. However, there is evidence that the attractiveness of superstar cities has declined over time. In addition, we find that the next-tier cities (i.e., alternative cities) become increasingly attractive to elites. These findings provide strong evidence of the crowding out effect on elites in Chinese superstar cities due to their housing unaffordability.","When the Communist Party took power in 1949, all new housing stocks in urban China were built by the government and allocated to state-unit employees for free (Huang, 2004). The welfare public housing system was officially abolished in 1998 and the overwhelming majority of public housing across the nation was privatized and sold to sitting tenants at a heavily discounted price within a few years; however, this reform did not trigger a significant housing boom immediately (Chen and Han, 2014). China's housing market started to surge in price in 2004 when the open auction and listing policy was implemented in the transfer of state-owned land use rights for all types of urban land (Deng et al., 2012, Li and Wu, 2014). However, housing price appreciation varied significantly over different tiers of cities, which may be largely due to varying land values and different policies of land supply in local markets (Dong, 2016, Gyourko et al., 2013, Liang et al., 2016, Wu et al., 2016).====Superstar cities in the literature are defined as the cities that experience persistently high housing price growth (e.g. Gyourko et al., 2013). Based on this definition, there are four Chinese superstar cities: Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen. Fig. 1 plots the average housing prices from 2004 to 2009 both in Chinese superstar cities and in the country as a whole.==== During the period, the price per square meters in superstar cities increased by US$665.27 in real terms from US$689.79 in 2004 to US$1355.06 in 2009, while the price per square meters for the nation increased by US$152.26 from US$202.79 in 2004 to US$355.05 in 2009, which is only 22.9% of the increase in superstar cities.====The increasing unaffordability of housing in post-reform urban China has recently attracted wide attention in the literature (e.g. Chen et al., 2010, Chen and Wen, 2017, Glaeser et al., 2016). However, Gyourko et al. (2013) find that the high degree of housing unaffordability largely occurs in superstar cities. This point is particularly true in China. With prices soaring in Chinese superstar cities since 2004, housing has become much more unaffordable in these cities than other cities, which is evident from Fig. 2. In 2004, the price to income ratio (PIR), which is measured by the ratio of average housing price to average household disposable income, is 7.34 for the nation and 10.60 for superstar cities.==== In 2009, the PIR did not change much for the nation and increased only by 1.39 from 7.34 to 8.83, but the PIR in superstar cites increased significantly and surged from 10.6 to 17.24.====Given the fact that housing has become increasingly unaffordable in Chinese superstar cities, there have been numerous media discussions on how young educated members of society are no longer choosing superstar cities as their most preferred location to settle down.==== Nevertheless, so far, it has yet to be proven whether highly-educated people really choose to stay away from Chinese superstar cities. Data-based empirical examinations to prove that claim have not yet been made.====This paper is the first to investigate whether higher educated people especially elites really opt out of Chinese superstar cities due to their housing unaffordability. In this paper, we define elites as those who have a master's degree or a higher level of education, primarily for two reasons.==== First, there is overwhelming evidence that education affects economic and political outcomes, such as earnings, citizenship behaviors, political involvement and economic growth (Besley et al., 2011, Card, 1999, Dee, 2004, Milligan et al., 2004). Secondly, highly educated people comprise a tiny proportion of the population. According to data from China's Urban Housing Survey, the proportions of people with a master's degree or a higher level of education from 2004 to 2009 are a mere 0.22%, 0.32%, 0.35%, 0.39%, 0.50%, and 0.55%, respectively.====This topic is particularly interesting in the Chinese context for two reasons. First, since state economic development policies traditionally lean toward big cities in China, superstar cities can provide better job opportunity and higher quality of infrastructure. As a result, they have a much bigger size and their advantage in agglomeration economy is larger than those in western countries (Au and Henderson, 2006, Combes et al., 2012a). Secondly, Chinese have an extensive tradition and a culture rooted in valuing the notion of homeownership, which is considered an important indicator of individual's social status in China (Li and Wu, 2014). In addition, a widening gender imbalance intensifies marriage competition for young men; and, consequently, owning a house is almost a prerequisite for marriage (Wei and Zhang, 2011). The soaring price in superstar cities over time makes homeownership much more difficult for anyone, including the elites who have a master's degree or a higher level of education.====Using both micro- and macro-level data obtained from China's Urban Household Survey and China Statistical Yearbook for Regional Economy for the period of 2004 to 2009,==== we find that in general, the elite class still prefers superstar cities. There are at least two reasons for the continuing attraction of superstar cities for elites. First, holding other things equal, we find that elites can earn much more in superstar cities than in other cities. Second, we also find that superstar cities provide much better amenities and higher quality of infrastructure. However, because of an increasing housing unaffordability in superstar cities and Chinese tradition of valuing homeownership, we find strong evidence that the attractiveness of superstar cities has declined over time.====In addition, we also find evidence that the next-tier cities (i.e., alternative cities) become increasingly attractive to elites for the following two reasons.==== First, the gap in amenities and the quality of infrastructure decreases significantly over time between superstar cities and alternative cities. Secondly, alternative cities are much more affordable. These findings strongly suggest there is a crowding out effect on elites in Chinese superstar cities due to their housing unaffordability.====The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we review the relevant literature. In Section 3, we discuss the data in our analysis, and then report our empirical findings in Section 4.

In recent years, however, those concerns have turned particularly acute, in the wake of deterioration in availability of affordable units and related popular protest in many western nations.==== Appropriate policy response, however, is predicated on accurate measurement of affordability burdens. Indeed, longstanding popular measures of affordability may be biased owing to failure to account for variability among households in housing preferences and consumption. In this paper, we address those concerns in development and assessment of a new normative consumption- and quality-adjusted measure of housing affordability. We employ the new measure to assess the incidence of affordability burdens as well as to compute a new Gini measure of affordability inequality. Finally, we evaluate how economy-wide trends in house prices and incomes affect the affordability burdens of severely affordability constrained households.====In the literature, housing affordability is typically represented by the relationship between housing costs and some ability-to-pay criterion (e.g., Robinson et al., 2006). Among the most prevalent method for assessing affordability is the house price-to-income ratio (e.g., Gan and Hill, 2009, Weicher, 1977, Bogdon and Can, 1997, Thalmann, 1999, Quigley and Raphael, 2004, Belsky et al., 2005, Stone, 2006; and Kim and Cho, 2010).==== However, the individual household price-to-income measure may be biased owing to varying individual preferences for consumption of housing services. For example, households may choose to reduce their consumption of housing services and hence be viewed as less affordability burdened. Conversely, households may consume excessive housing services and hence appear to be highly affordability burdened (see also Thalmann, 1999).====In this study, we propose a new normative measure that corrects for the above-described consumption bias in the assessment of housing affordability. Our proposed measure is normative in the sense that it is endogenously derived, varies over time and space, and represents current consumption typical of similarly situated households. To compute the new measure, we employ extensive micro-data on Israeli households over the 1998–2015 period to identify the typical housing consumption bundle of households stratified by demographic and locational characteristics. We then match each household in our sample to the average housing consumption bundle of similar households. We also estimate housing hedonic price indices for each city in Israel for the timeframe of the analysis using the universe of housing transactions. Given computed information on normative household housing consumption, the pricing thereof via hedonic price equations, and housing net income, we compute a quality- and consumption-adjusted measure of housing affordability. We compare results of the new consumption-adjusted affordability measure to standard unadjusted measures.==== Both measures give rise to substantial evidenced decline in housing affordability in Israel over recent decades. Further, failure to correct for housing consumption variability results in understatement of affordability burdens among a large number of sample stratifications. We also compute a Gini measure of inequality in housing affordability; the consumption-adjusted measure shows a substantially larger housing Gini coefficient.====We further evaluate systematic variability in our new affordability measure across household demographic and locational traits. A few prior studies, including Skaburskis, 1997, Skaburskis, 2004), Charlier et al., (2001), and Lin et al., (2014), have used micro-data to examine the association between housing affordability and household attributes in Canada, Taiwan, and The Netherlands, respectively. Malpezzi (1999) and Ben-Shahar and Warszawski (2011) estimate the relationship between macro measures of housing affordability and market indicators in the United States and Israel, respectively.==== Results of our analysis show that consumption-adjusted affordability burdens in Israel are elevated among low educational attainment, minority, and immigrant households. Further, those associations vary across the new consumption-adjusted and traditional measures. Finally, we assess how trending up in house prices and incomes in Israel over the course of recent decades has affected affordability among disadvantaged populations, notably including those living in areas peripheral to the primary coastal agglomeration of economic activity. Findings show the incidence of those economy-wide trends to be substantially more adverse among highly affordability-burdened households. Further, the trending up in those indices in Israel in recent years has been even more harmful to highly affordability-burdened households residing in outlying, peripheral areas.====The primary contributions of our paper are as follows. First, we introduce a new method for estimating housing affordability that addresses potential bias in traditional measures by adjusting for normative housing consumption. We use that measure to compute estimates of consumption-adjusted affordability as well as Gini-based indices of affordability inequality. The new consumption-adjusted measure suggests more marked deterioration in Israel housing affordability and related affordability inequality. We identify variance in normative affordability across household socio-demographic and locational traits and show more severe affordability burdens among Israel minority and disadvantaged groups. Finally, we show an adverse incidence of recent trending up in Israel economy-wide house price and income trends as regards the consumption-adjusted affordability burdens of less privileged groups, especially those living on the outlying, peripheral areas. In marked contrast, those same macro trends are associated with improved relative affordability among the least burdened segment of households, especially those living in Israel's superstar Tel Aviv location. That evidence may prove useful to policymakers in designing programs aimed at mitigating housing distress.====The paper is organized as follows. The next section describes the sample, variable definitions, and related summary statistics. Section 3 details our approach to estimating consumption- and quality-adjusted housing affordability. Section 4 examines housing affordability inequality under the consumption-adjusted, as compared to the standard approach. Section 5 identifies individual characteristics associated with elevated affordability burdens. Section 6 studies the incidence of recent economy-wide income and house price trends on housing affordability among disadvantaged groups. Finally, Section 7 provides a summary and concluding remarks.",Housing affordability and inequality:A consumption-adjusted approach,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105113771730270X,1 March 2018,2018,Research Article,185.0
